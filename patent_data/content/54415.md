Although use of stabilizer compounds in heat developable and heat stabilizable photographic materials is known from U.S. Patent 4,012,260, a need exists in the art for water soluble, organic stabilizers and fixing agents. The problem facing the art is that the known compounds lack sufficient water solubility to permit their effective use in photographic silver halide materials to provide light insensitive silver I complexes upon exposure and processing. Such complexes provide light stability to developed images in processed photographic silver halide materials. The present invention provides a photographic material which contains a silver halide stabilizing and fixing agent which is capable of forming a water soluble, light insensitive silver I complex upon exposure and processing of the photographic silver halide material. According to the invention, a developed and stabilized silver image is provided in a heat developable and heat stabilizable photographic silver halide material comprising a support having thereon a layer which contains, or adjacent layers which together contain a photographic silver halide, preferably as a photographic silver halide gelatino emulsion b a photographic silver halide developing agent c an activating concentration of a thermal base releasing compound d a stabilizing concentration of a mesoionic 1,2,4 triazolium 3 thiolate silver halide compound, and e a binder.

The resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for one hour and the water was removed under reduced pressure. The residual oily acethydrazide, CH3N COCH3 NH2, was suspended in diethyl ether and to this stirred mixture at room temperature was slowly added a diethylether 25 ml solution of methyl isothiocyanate 7.3 g, 0.1 mol .The resulting stirred solution was kept at room temperature for 30 minutes and then the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residual colorless solid was triturated with diethyl ether to give 4.9 g 30 percent of the thiosemicarbazide a white powder m.p., 180 to 181us literature m.p. 175 to 177VC . The thiosemicarbazide 5.0 g, 0.03 mol was refluxed in a methanol 25 ml solution for 21 hours. During this reflux period, the thiosemicarbazide completely dissolved in the refluxing methanol and the triazolium thiolate, a colorless solid, then separated m.p., 258 to 259UC m.p. reported in literature, 256 to 257QC . Another illustrative method is the preparation of l,5 dimethyl 4 2 methoxy ethyl 1,2,4 triazolium 3 thiolate as follows Crude acethydrazide prepared from acetic anhydride 10.2 g, 0.1 mol and methylhydrazine 4.6 g, 0.1 mol , as described above, was dissolved in diethyl ether 25 ml and to the resulting stirred translucent solution at room temperature was slowly added a diethyl ether 25 ml solution of 2 methoxyethyl isothiocyanate 11.7 g, 0.1 mol . After keeping the stirred solution at ambient temperature for one hour, the ether was removed under reduced pressure. More diethyl ether was added to the residual pale yellow syrup, and the resulting composition was stirred at ambient temperature for 18 hours. The thiosemicarbazide 2.4 g, 0.012 mol was heated to its melting point 123VC and held at this temperature for five hours. After cooling to ambient temperature, the crystalline residue was recrystallized from ethyl acetate ethanol 1 1 by volume to yield 1.3 g 59 percent of pale yellow plates m.p., 125 to 126to mass spectrum M 187. The structure of the desired product was confirmed by mass spectral analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance. An illustration of an alternate method of preparation is the synthesis of 1,5 dimethyl 4 2 methoxyethyl l ,2,4 triazolium 3 thiolate as follows A stirred dichloromethane 40 ml mixture of 2 methoxyethyl isocyanide dichloride 1.9 g, 0.012 mol and CH3 CS N CH3 NH2 1.3 g, 0.012 mol was refluxed for two hours. Solvent was then removed under reduced pressure and the residual orange semi solid was dissolved in 50 ml of methanol.One half of this solution was evaporated to dryness and was then dissolved in methylene chloride 50 ml . Ammonia gas was bubbled through this stirred solution at ambient temperature for about 5 minutes.The resulting precipitate presumably ammonium chloride was collected, and the filtrate was evaporated to dryness to yield a reddish brown semi solid. A stirred ethanol 50 ml solution of this solid was refluxed for 18 hours. Solvent was removed under reduced pressure to give a slowly separating orange oil. An ethyl acetate solution of this material was treated with decolorizing carbon and eluted through a diatomaceous SiO2 absorptive filter aid Celite trade mark . The ethyl acetate elute was concentrated to about 25 ml, and colorless plates began to separate. The desired compound was recovered and had a melting point of 123 to 12500. The desired products are purified by procedures known in the chemical art, such as by recrystallization. One embodiment of the invention is a heat developable and heat stabilizable photographic silver halide material comprising a support having thereon a layer which contains, or adjacent layers which together contain a photographic silver halide, preferably as a photographic silver halide gelatino emulsion, b a photographic silver halide developing agent, c an activating concentration of a thermal base releasing compound, d a stabilizing concentration of a mesoionic 1,2, 4 triazolium 3 thiolate stabilizer compound as defined herein, and e a binder. The photographic material according to the invention comprises photographic silver halide. Useful photographic silver halides include, for example, silver chloride, silver bromide, silver bromoiodide, silver chlorobromoiodide and mixtures thereof. The grain size of the silver halide ranges from coarse grain to fine grain. The photographic silver halide is prepared by procedures known in the photographic art, as described in, for example, Research Disclosure, December 1978, Item No. 17643, and Research Disclosure, June 1978, Item No. 17029. The photographic materials according to the invention, if desired, also contain addenda which do not adversely affect the desired properties of the materials, such as antifoggants, tone modifiers, chemical sensitizers, hardeners, matting agents, brighteners, absorbing and filter dyes, development modifiers, spectral sensitizers and coating aids, as described in these Research Disclosure publications. The heat developable and heat stabilizable photographic materials according to the invention contain binders and vehicles alone and in combination. Suitable vehicle materials include both naturally occurring substances, such as protein, for example, gelatin, gelatin derivatives, cellulose derivatives, polysaccharides such as dextrin or gum arabic and synthetic polymeric materials such as water soluble polyvinyl compounds such as poly vinyl pyrrolidone or acrylamide polymers. The photographic layers and other layers of the materials of the invention such as overcoat layers, interlayers and subbing layers can also contain, alone or in combination with the described vehicles, other synthetic polymeric vehicle compounds, such as dispersed vinyl compounds, such as in latex from, in particular those which increase the dimensional stability of the photographic materials.Useful binders are also described in the above ResearchDisclosure publications. Selection of an optimum binder depends upon such factors as the processing conditions, the particular components of the photographic material and the desired image. Many supports are useful for a photographic materialaccording to the invention. Typical supports include those which are resistant to adverse changes in structure and do not adversely affect the sensitometric properties of the described photographic materials at the processing temperatures employed. Typical supports include cellulose ester film, poly vinyl acetal film, poly ethylene terephthalate film, polycarbonate film and related films and resinous materials, as well as glass, paper or metal. The stabilizer according to the invention is in a location in the photographic material which enables the stabilizer to react with the silver halide in the unexposed areas upon processing to form a stable silver I complex. The stabilizer is useful in one or more layers of a photographic material according to the invention. The stabilizer is preferably in an overcoat layer or in a layer between the support and the layer containing silver halide. It is important that the stabilizer be in a location which enables the desired interaction between the stabilizer and the silver halide at the proper time during processing. The term in reactive association is often used to mean that the stabilizer and silver halide are in such locations as to enable such desired interaction Many silver halide developing agents are useful according to the invention. Combinations of silver halide developing agents are useful. Useful silver halide developing agents include those described in, for instance, Research Disclosure, June 1978, Item No. 17029. A preferred silver halide developing agent is ascorbic acid. Many thermal base releasing compounds are useful in a heat developable and heat stabilizable photographic material according to the invention. The term thermal base releasing compound as used herein means a compound which releases an organic base when heated to processing temperature in a photographic material according to the invention. The released base activates development of the exposed photographic silver halide at processing temperature. The activating concentration of the base release agent means that the concentration of base release agent is sufficient in the photographic material to release a sufficient amount of base upon processing to activate development. The base released also helps stabilization by the stabilizer according to the invention. Examples of useful thermal base releasing compounds are described inResearch Disclosure, June 1978, Item No. 17029, and include guanidinium trichloroacetate, 1, 1 dimethyl 1 2 hydroxypropyl amine adipimide, l B amino ethyl 2 imidazolidone, trichloroacetate, zinc oxide and urea. The optimum concentration of each of a the photographic silver halide, b photographic silver halide developing agent, c thermal base release agent, and d stabilizer according to the invention will depend upon such factors as the desired image, processing conditions and particular components and their respective concentration in the heat developable and heat stabilizable photographic material.In a photographic material according to the invention, useful concentrations, per square meter of support, are within the following ranges a photographic silver halide 2.5 x 10 to 1.0 x 10 1 moles, preferably 1.0 x 1012 to 3.0 x 10 2 moles b photographic silver halide developing agent 2.5 x 10 to 1.0 x 10 1 moles, preferably 1.0 x 10 2 to 3.0 x moles c thermal base releasing agent 1.15 x 10 to 5.0 x 10 2 moles, preferably 5.0 x 10 to 1.5 x 10 moles d stabilizer 2.5 x 10 3 to 1.0 x 10 1 moles, preferably 1.0 x 10 2 to 3 x 10 2 moles. An especially useful heat developable and heat stabilizable photographic material according to the invention comprises a support having thereon a layer which contains, or adjacent layers which together contain a photographic silver halide gelatino emulsion, such as a photographic silver bromide gelatino emulsion b a photographic silver halide developing agent, such as a photographic silver bromide developing agent, preferably ascorbic acid c an activating concentration oi a thermal base releasing compound consisting essentially of an ethylenebis sulfonyl acetic acid compound, d a stabilizing concentration of a 1,2,4 triazolium 3 thiolate stabilizer consisting essentially of mesoionic 1,4,5 trimethyl 1,2,4 triazolium 3 thiolate, and e a gelatino binder. The stabilìzerecompounds are useful in photographic silver halide processing compositions. SuchWprocessing compositions include silver halide monobaths, stabilizing compositions, fixing compositions, hardeners and other processing compositions that enable the stabilizer according to the invention to form a silver 1 complex without adversely affecting desired properties of the processing composition and the photographic silver halide material. An example of a silver halide processing composition comprises a silver halide developing agent, a thermal base release agent and a stabilizer according to the invention, such as mesoionic 1,4,5 trimethyl1,2,4 triazolium 3 thiolate. The processing composition generally comprises a solvent or binder. A processing composition according to the invention is useful as a layer of a photographic silver halide material, such as a layer contiguous to the layer of the material comprising photographic silver halide. Alternatively, the processing composition is useful in the form of a bath into which an exposed and developed photographic silver halide material is immersed. Other processing methods and processing compositions in which the mesoionic silver halide stabilizers according to the invention are useful are described in, for instance, ResearchDisclosure, December 1978, Item limo. 17643. A usetul processing composition according to the invention is a photographic silver halide fixing composition comprising a silver halide fixing concentration of a mesionic 1,2,4 triazolium 3thiolate. A preferred photographic silver haliae fixing composition comprises a fixing solution comprising, in an aqueous solvent, a fixing concentration of a mesoionic 1,2,4 triazolium 3thiolate and an organic acid, such as acetic acid. Because the described stabilizer compounds provide stable silver I complexes, no additional silver halide stabilizer is necessary in a photographic material according to the invention. Atter exposure of a photographic silver halide material according to the invention, an image is developed and stabilized by heating the material to a processing temperature within the range of about l000C to about lbO0C, such as about 100C to about 140çC, until the image is developed and stabilized.An image is generally developed and stabilized by heating for about one to about 60 seconds, such as about 10 to about 30 seconds. Normal atmospheric conditions of pressure and humidity are preferred for processing. Various means are useful for heating the exposed photographic silver halide material, including a simple hot plate, iron, rollers, dielectric heating means or microwave heating means. The following examples are included for a further understanding of the invention.Example 1 Silver Halide Stabilization Compound A was added to the following composition Concentration Component per dmê Silver chloride 0.24 micron 6.1 mmol grain size ethylenebis sulfonyl acetic 0.05 mmol acid thermal base releas ing compound photographic gelatin 27.0 mg surfactant Surfactant lOG, 1 trade mark for a para isononyl phenoxypolyglycidol available from the Olin Corporation, U.S.A.
