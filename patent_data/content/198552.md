# Equipment for producing conical products.

## Abstract
With an installation for manufacturing conical objects from two webs 5, 6 of flexible material, conical valves for bags can be made in an efficient manner since a guiding device 8 is mounted consisting of two change direction irons, 15, 16 positioned in the same planes as the ones in which the webs come out of the folding device. For the guiding device enables the folded webs to continuously shift into each other with the open sides facing each other. Furthermore the installation should have a chop off device 10 a glueing device 19, 20 and a driving apparatus 17, 18 .

## Description
INSTALLATION FOR MANUFACTURING CONICAL OBJECTS.THE INVENTION RELATES TO AN INSTALLATION FORMANUFACTURING CONICAL OBJECTS, SUCH AS VALVES FORPACKAGE BAGS, FROM TWO WEBS OF FLEXIBLE MATERIAL,BEING FED INTO THE INSTALLATION FROM ROLLS.A VALVE IS A TUBULAR DEVICE MADE OF FLEXIBLEMATERIAL, THROUGH WHICH A BAG OF FLEXIBLE MATERIAL CANBE FILLED AND WHICH CAN CLOSE THE OPENING IN THE BAGAFTER THAT. FOR FILLING1 THE VALVE IS SLID ABOUT AFILLING PIPE AND IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE OPENING OFTHE FILLING PIPE EXTENDS THROUGH THE INNER END OF THEVALVE INTO THE BAG.USUALLY THE SHAPE OF THE VALVE IS CYLINDRICAL. IF SLIDABOUT THE FILLING PIPE. DURING PRODUCTION AND TRANSPORTOF THE EMPTY BAG THE VALVE IS FOLDED FLAT AND THUS HASA RECTANGULAR SHAPE.A CONICAL VALVE IS NOT CYLINDRICAL, BUT HAS THE SHAPEOF THE SURFACE OF A FLATTENED CONE. DURING PRODUCTIONAND TRANSPORT OF THE EMPTY BAG THE VALVE IS FOLDED FLATAND HAS THE SHAPE OF A TRAPEZIUM. THE VALVE HAS TWO FUNCTIONS TO ENCLOSE THE FILLING PIPE AS THOROUGHLY AS POSSIBLE DURING FILLING AND TO TRANSFORM IT IN SUCH A MANNER AFTER FILLING THAT THE FILLING GOOD IS PREVENTED FROM PASSING THROUGH TO OUTSIDE.THE CONICAL VALVE IS FAR MORE SATISFACTORY IN BOTHFUNCTIONS THAN THE CYLINDRICAL VALVE KNOWN UP TO NOW.THERE ARE VALVES IN WHICH THE CYLINDRICAL SHAPE HASBEEN PURPORTLY ABANDONED, BUT OF THOSE ONLY EMBODIMENTSARE KNOWN WHICH HAVE BEEN MANUFACTURED BY SEALING THECONTACT SURFACES AND THUS THEY HAVE TO BE MADE OFSEALABLE MATERIAL. SUCH AN EMBODIMENT HAS BEEN DESCRIBEDIN BRITISH PATENT SPECIFICATION 1,000,335.THE INVENTION AIMS TO PROVIDE AN INSTALLATION FORMANUFACTURING CONICAL OBJECTS, SUCH AS VALVES FORBAGS, WHICH DO NOT HAVE TO BE MADE OF SEALABLE MATERIAL.ACCORDING TO THE INVENTION1 THE INSTALLATION ISCHARACTERIZED IN THAT IT COMPRISES A FOLDING DEVICE THAT CAN FOLD IN TWO SAID TWO WEBS LENGTHWISE, A GUIDING DEVICE THAT CAN SHIFT SAID FOLDED WEBS INTO EACH OTHER WITH THE OPEN SIDES FACING EACH OTHER, A DRIVING APPARATUS1 A CHOP OFF DEVICE, AND A GLUEING DEVICE.IF THE INSTALLATION IS USED FOR MANUFACTURING CONICALVALVES FOR BAGS, IT IS VERY PRACTICAL TO MOUNT AGRABBING DEVICE WHICH IS ABLE TO TRANSFER THE CHOPPED OFF VALVE TO A VALVE MOUNTING DEVICE.THE FOLDING DEVICE MAY CONSIST OF TWO PAIRS OFOPTIONALLY FREELY ROTATING, PERPENCIDULARLYINTERSECTING PINS.THE GUIDING DEVICE MAY CONSIST OF TWO CHANGE DIRECTIONIRONS POSITIONED IN THE SAME PLANES AS THE ONES INWHICH THE WEBS COME OUT OF THE FOLDING DEVICE.THE DRIVING APPARATUS MAY BE POSITIONED BETWEEN THEGUIDING DEVICE AND THE CHOP OFF DEVICE, AND MAYCONSIST OF ROTATABLY DRIVEN DRIVING ROLLS FOR EACH OFTHE WEBS, IN WHICH THE CENTRE LINES OF THE DRIVINGROLLS ARE AT AN ANGLE WITH RESPECT TO EACH OTHER WHICHIS EQUAL TO THE SUPPLEMENT OF THE ANGLE AT WHICH THEFOLDED WEBS WITH THE OPEN SIDES FACING EACH OTHER CANBE SHIFTED INTO EACH OTHER. THIS ANGLE IS PREFERABLYABOUT 2 X 5d. THE GLUEING DEVICE MAY COMPRISE TWO NOZZLE PIPES WHICHCAN COVER THE OVERLAP OF THE SHIFTED1 FOLDED WEBS WITHGLUE.THE CHOP OFF DEVICE AND THE GRABBING DEVICE AREPREFERABLY MECHANICALLY COUPLED.THE INVENTION WILL BE ELUCIDATED HEREAFTER ON THEBASIS OF THE DRAWING, IN WHICH BY MEANS OF AN EXAMPLEAN INSTALLATION ACCORDING TO THE INVENTION IS SHOWN.IN THE DRAWING,FIG. 1 SHOWS AN OUTLINE OF THE INSTALLATION IN QUESTION IN PERSPECTIVE,FIG. 2 SHOWS AT A LARGER SCALE THE UPPER PORTION OF THEFOLDING DEVICE IN PERSPECTIVE, ANDFIG. 3 SHOWS AT A LARGER SCALE THE GUIDING DEVICE ANDTHE OTHER DEVICES POSITIONED NEARBY IN PERSPECTIVE.THE INSTALLATION SHOWN IN FIG. 1 FOR MANUFACTURINGCONICAL OBJECTS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPRISES TWO PARALLEL,HORIZONTAL SHAFTS 1 AND 2 FOR ROTATABLY SUPPORTINGTWO ROLLS 3 AND 4 OF FLEXIBLE MATERIAL, IN WHICH ROLL 3PROVIDES AN UPPER WEB 5 AND ROLL 4 A LOWER WEB 6.BOTH WEBS 5 AND 6 PASS THROUGH A FOLDING DEVICE 7,SHOWN IN MORE DETAIL IN FIG. 21 AND IN WHICH THE WEBSARE NOT ONLY FOLDED IN TWO BUT ALSO CHANGED INDIRECTION OVER 900.AFTER THAT THE WEBS 5 AND 6 ENTER A GUIDING DEVICE 8IN WHICH THE FOLDED WEBS ARE SHIFTED INTO EACH OTHERWITH THE OPEN SIDES FACING EACH OTHER. AT THAT POINTTHERE IS ALSO A DRIVING APPARATUS 9, A CHOP OFF DEVICE 10, A GLUE SUPPLY 111 BEING ELUCIDATED IN MORE DETAILIN FIG. 3, AND A GRABBING DEVICE 12 WHICH TRANSFERSTHE FINISHED CONICAL VALVE, AFTER IT HAS BEEN CHOPPEDOFF PERPENDICULAR TO THE BISECTRICE OF THE ANGLEBETWEEN THE WEBS, TO A VALVE MOUNTING DEVICE NOT SHOWN .THIS LATTER ACTION PARTICULARLY IMPLIES, THAT THE NEWVALVE IS DIRECTLY USED IN THE USUAL MANNER FORFINISHING A BAG. THE ACTION OF THE TWO WEBS BEINGSHIFTED INTO EACH OTHER WILL CONTINUE UNDISTURBED INORDER TO FORM THE NEXT CONICAL VALVE. IN FIG. 2 THE UPPER HALVE OF THE FOLDING DEVICE 7 ISSHOWN, IN WHICH IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT THE LOWER HALVEIS THE SYMMETRICALLY REFLECTED IMAGE OF FIG. 2. THEUPPER HALVE OF THE FOLDING DEVICE CONSISTS OF TWO PAIRSOF OPTIONALLY FREELY ROTATING, PERPENDICULARLY INTERSECTING PINS 13 AND 14. THE PIN 14 SUPPORTING THE WEBFOLDED IN TWO, NATURALLY HAS A LENGTH BEING ABOUT HALFTHE LENGTH OF PIN 13 WHICH SUPPORTS THE STILL UNFOLDEDWEB.THE GUIDING DEVICE 8 COMPRISES TWO CHANGE DIRECTIONIRONS 15 AND 161 POSITIONED IN THE SAME PLANES AS THEONES IN WHICH THE WEBS 5 AND 6 COME OUT OF THE FOLDINGDEVICE 7. THIS IMPLIES THAT THE WEBS 5 AND 6 AREGUIDED ABOUT IN SUCH A MANNER, THAT THEY PREFERABLYMOVE 50 TOWARDS EACH OTHER TWICE AT AN ANGLE ANDREMAINING IN THE SAME PLANE.AFTER THIS, THE OPEN SIDES OF THE WEBS 5 AND 6 AREPOSITIONED ON THE INSIDE OF THE SAID ANGLE.THE DRIVING APPARATUS 9 CONSISTS OF TWO ROTATABLYDRIVEN DRIVING ROLLS 17 AND 18 WITH CENTRE LINES BEINGAT A MUTUAL ANGLE WHICH IS EQUAL TO THE SUPPLEMENT OFTHE ANGLE AT WHICH THE OPEN SIDE OF THE FOLDED WEB 6IS SHIFTED THROUGH THE DRIVING ROLL 18 INTO THE OPENSIDE OF THE FOLDED WEB 5. THIS ANGLE IS OPTIONAL, BUTPREFERABLY IT IS ABOUT 2 X 50. IN THE SHOWN EMBODIMENTTHE DRIVING ROLLS 17 AND 18 PULL THE WEBS 5 AND 6 BOTHABOUT THE CHANGE DIRECTION IRONS 15 AND 16 OF THEGUIDING DEVICE 8 AND OVER THE OPTIONALLY FREELYROTATING PINS 13 AND 14 OF THE FOLDING DEVICE 7. THISGUARANTEES THAT CORRECT FOLDS ARE APPLIED AND THAT THE WEBS ARE SHIFTED INTO EACH OTHER CORRECTLY. IN FIG. 3 THE POSITION OF THE CHOP OFF DEVICE 10, THEGLUE SUPPLY 11, AND THE GRABBING DEVICE 12 WITHRESPECT TO EACH OTHER ARE SHOWN. THE GLUE SUPPLYCONSISTS OF TWO NOZZLE PIPES 19 AND 20 THAT CANCOVER THE OVERLAPS 21 WITH GLUE. AS SOON AS THAT HASBEEN DONE, THE CHOP OFF DEVICE 10 AND THE GRABBINGDEVICE 12 START ACTING IN THE KNOWN MANNER TO TRANSFERTHE FINISHED VALVE TO A VALVE MOUNTING DEVICE NOT SHOWN IT IS REMARKED, THAT ALTHOUGH THE INVENTION ISDESCRIBED ON THE BASIS OF AN INTALLATION FORMANUFACTURING CONICAL VALVES, THE MERIT OF THE INVENTIONCAN OF COURSE ALSO BE APPLIED IN THE MANUFACTURE OFOTHER CONICAL OBJECTS,
