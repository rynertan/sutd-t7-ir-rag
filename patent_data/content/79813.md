# Composition for backing carpets.

## Abstract
A composition for backing a carpet, which contains a 5 to 65 by weight of an olefin polar monomer copolymer having a polar monomer content of 5 to 40 by weight, b 1 to 50 by weight of a synthetic oil comprising one or more non condensed tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds having a boiling point of 250 C or higher and a molecular weight of 258 to 482, and being liquid at room temperature, c 30 to 90 by weight of an inorganic filler, and, if necessary, up to 50 by weight of a solid low molecular compound component. The composition is particularly use ful for automobile carpets and carpet tiles. The composition provides flexibility during blending, a high flexibility, and, in particular, a superior performance at low temperatures.
