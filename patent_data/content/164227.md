## Description
NEOALKOXY ORGANO TITANATES AND ORGANO ZIRCONATES USEFUL AS COUPLING AND POLYMER PROCESSING AGENTS Background of the Invention The use of monoalkoxy organo titanates, i.e., those containing primary, secondary or tertiary alkoxy groups directly attached to titanium, as coupling agents for particulate material and polymeric resins is well known. See U.S. Patent No. 4,122,062. While these materials have proven effective, they could not be used directly where the polymeric systems required compounding at temperatures substantially in excess of 200 C, because these known organo titantes had insufficient thermal and or solvolytic stability. Accordingly, with such compounds it was necessary to first mechanically preblend at temperatures below 2000C in advance of polymeric resin compounding above 2000C.This two step process, which is also necessary with other coupling agents, e.g., silanes, alumino zirconates and aluminates, is both costly and time consuming, requiring the use of special equipment. Furthermore, the known alkoxy titanates have exhibited poor performance because of their relatively low stability in the presence of certain solvents, particularly water at elevated temperatures. This drawback has made these organo titanates ineffective for applications requiring long periods of storage stability in proton containing solvents, such as alcohols and ketones and in ester plasticizers. Brief Description of the Invention It has now been discovered that neoalkoxy organo titanates and organo zirconates, a new groups of compounds, overcome both of the above mentioned deficiencies and, in addition, enhance the performance of polymer matrices whether or not they contain particulate. This latter effect relates to the ability of these novel neoalkoxy organo titanates and organo zirconates to remain stable at elevated temperatures, i.e., over 200 C, for a sufficient period in processing equipment used to form high temperature polymers. This stability, particularly in high shear systems, permits the interaction of the titanate or zirconate with the polymer during polymerization, so as to alter the rheological characteristics associated with such processing.The exact mode of performance enhancement is, as yet, incompletely understood, but is believed to involve wall shear reduction, antioxidant and or polymer component rearrangement activity. It is certain, however, that the special structure associated with the neoalkoxy group provides sufficient thermal and solvolytic stabilization to permit the novel materials to be employed in selected areas where the prior art organo titanates, because of their instability, were non functional or degraded the performance characteristics of the polymer compositions. The neoalkoxy zirconates are particularly useful for peroxide cured and air cured systems, since they accelerate the polymerization reaction. On the other hand, the titanates because of their tendency to oxidize free radicals inhibit such polymerizations.Hence, the neoalkoxy zirconates most unexpectedly provide a means of both coupling filler to the polymer and accelerating the polymerization. In addition, the neoalkoxy zirconates give polymer composites having most beneficial thixotropic properties that is, such materials exhibit low viscosity under high shear and high viscosity under low shear. This is most beneficial since the low viscosity under high shear facilitates spraying and other applications of the polymeric material, while the high viscosity low shear as for example under storage conditions prevents settling and enhances the shelf life of such polymers. A still further advantage of the organo zirconates is their ability to maintain their coupling capability even in the presence of moisture. This is of substantial importance in the case of fiberglas reinforced unsaturated polyesters. Slanes, on the other hand, cannot be used in such applications because of their adverse effect on processability.Isocyanates used as thixotropes in such applications suffered from the problems of toxicity and sensitivity to moisture. The organo zirconates are also outstanding in silicon resin applications, since they are most effective in bonding silicon resin to glass. Details of the Invention The subject invention relates to novel neoalkoxy organo titanium which may be represented by the formula EMI3.1 wherein M is titanium or zirconium, R, R1 and R2 are each a monovalent alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aralkyl, aryl or alkaryl group having up to 20 carbon atoms or a halogen er ether substituted derivate thereof, and, in addition, R2 may also be an oxy derivate of said groups. The various R, R1 and R2 may each contain up to three ether oxygen or halogen substituents, provided the total number of carbon atoms for each such R group does not exceed 20, inclusive of the carbon atoms contained in substituent portions.A, B and C may be an aroxy ArO , thioaroxy ArS , diester phosphate R30 R40 P O O , diester pyrophosphate R30 R40 P O OP O , oxyalkylamino R5R6NR7O , sulfonyl ArS O 2O or carboxyl RC O O . Each group may contain up to 30 carbon atoms. Ar, in the above formulas, may be a monovalent aryl or alkaryl group having from 6 to about 20 carbon atoms, optionally containing up to 3 ether oxygen substituents, and substituted derivatives thereof wherein the substitutions are up to a total of three halogens or amino groups having the formula NR8R9 wherein R8 and R9 are each hydrogen, an alkyl group having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, an alkenyl group having from 2 to 8 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms, and an aryl group having from 6 to 12 carbon atoms and R3 and R4 may each be the same group as R, R1 and Ar. R5 and R6 may be hydrogen, an alkyl or aminoalkyl group having from 1 to 15 carbon atoms and R7 may be an alkylene group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms or an arylene group having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms or a combination thereof and a b c is equal to 3. A wide variety of ligands, subject to the limitations heretofore expressed, may be used in the practice of this invention. The most suitable for a particular application will depend largely upon the polymer system employed and, to a lesser degree, upon the particular curative and or extenders introduced into such system, if any. Particulary preferred examples of the R, R1 and R2 groups are alkyl having 1 to 8 carbon atoms aralkyl having 6 to 10 carbon atoms such as benzyl the aryl and alkaryl groups having from 6 to 10 carbon atoms including phenyl, naphthyl, tolyl, xylyl and the halogen substituted bromophenyl and the allyloxy substituted alkyl having from 4 to 20 carbon atoms and the allyloxy substituted aryl having from 9 to 20 carbon atoms. Where R2 is an oxy derivative, the most preferred compounds are the alkoxy derivatives having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms and the phenoxy group. Preferred R3 and R4 groups are alkyl groups having 1 to 12 carbon atoms, aryl and alkaryl groups having from 6 to 12 carbon atoms and ether substituted alkyl having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms. Examples of specific R, R1, R2, R3 and R4 groups are methyl, propyl, cyclohexyl, 2,4 dimethoxybenzyl, 1 methyl 4 acenaphthyl 2 ethyl 2 furyl and methallyl. R2, in addition, may be methoxy, phenoxy, naphthenoxy, cyclohexene 3 oxy, 4 isobutyl 3methoxy, l phenanthroxy and 2,4,6 trimethylphenoxy. Examples of A, B and C ligands useful in the practice of this invention are likewise numerous. These include aryl and thioaryl ligands such as phenoxy, 2,4 dimethyl 1 naphthoxy, 3 octyl 1phenanthroxy and 3,5 diethyl 2 thioanthryl and 2 methyl 3 methoxy thiophenyl as well as diester phosphates such as dibutyl, methylphenyl, cyclohexyl, lauryl and bismethoxyethoxyethyl phosphate and their pyrophosphate analogs as well as aryl sulfonyl groups such as phenylsulfonyl, 2 ,4 dibutyl 1 naphthalene sulfonyl and 2 methyl 3 ethyl 4 phenanthryl sulfonyl. Particularly effective are carboxyl groups such as acetyl, methacryl, stearyl, 4 phenoxy and 4 phenoxy butyl.

A variety of processes can be used to prepare compositions of the invention.These are illustrated inExamples A through C. In the first process, shown in Example A, one mole of an alcohol 12 of the formula RR1R2CH20H the hydrophilic precursor is reacted with 3 moles of a compound of the formula H A a B b C c the hydrophobic precursor and one mole of titanium or zirconium tetrachloride. The reaction may take place in the presence of a solvent such as xylene at temperature of from 2O0C to 1400C. Hydrogen chloride gas is involved. A second method which may be used is described specifically inExample B. Here a tetraalkoxy titanate or zirconate is substituted for the titanium tetrachloride. Here the reaction is carried out at a temperature of from O C to 2000 C. During the course of the reaction four moles of alcohol, corresponding to the alkoxy groups on the titanium or zirconium compound, are evolved. It will be understood that in the foregoing reactions one or more hydrophobic precursors may be used to form the neoalkoxy compound. The third method of the invention involves the admixture of two titanate or zirconate compounds, the first containing four neoalkoxy hydrophilic radicals and the second containing four hydrophobic radicals. By mixing one mole of the former with three moles of the latter a reaction product having the structure of the neoalkoxy compounds of the invention can be obtained. This procedure is generally carried out in the presence pf a solvent such as toluene at a temperature of OOC to 15O0C. In addition to the neoalkoxy compounds, the instant invention also relates to compositions containing the neoalkoxy compounds and polymers, particulate material treated with the neoalkoxy compounds, and blends of polymers, particulate material and the neoalkoxy compounds. Even a small amount of the neoalkoxy compounds markedly affects the rheological properties of polymers and therefore makes these compounds useful as processing aids. The interaction between the external surfaces and the polymer can be measured by melt flow index.As is well known in the art, flow characteristics of the resin are particularly important during processing and shaping of the polymers, as for example by extrusion or injection molding. While a wide variety of polymers may be treated with the neoalkoxy compounds of the invention, the admixture thereof are particularly useful with engineering plastics, which are conventionally processed between 2000 and 4000C. The organo titanates of the prior art were not satisfactory in this application, because of their lack of stability.It should be understood, however, that the neoalkoxy compounds may also be blended with other resins such as PVC and used in paint and other coating applications, in the latter cases because of the solvent stability of these compounds. Broadly, from 0.005 to 5 wt. Z of the neoalkoxy compounds are added to the resin, preferably from 0.1 to 1.0X. If the amount of the neoalkoxy compound added is greater than that needed to affect the surface properties of the resin, the neoalkoxy compounds will have a plasticizing effect on the resin. The optimum amount of the neoalkoxy compounds added to the resins may be readily determined by those skilled in the art by consideration of the examples set forth herein and by simple experimentation. By so proceeding, the desired flow properties for a particular resin can be reasily achieved. Examples of the engineering plastics which may be admixed with neoalkoxy compounds include epoxy resins, fluorocarbons, modified phenylene oxides, nylons, polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, phenolics, polyamides, polycarbonates, polyetheretherketones, polyaryletherketones, polyether imides, polyphenylene sulfides, polysulfones, polyarylsulfones, styrene, polyester copolymers, styrenics, such as, polystyreneacrylonitrilebutadiene styrene, styrene actylonitrile, styrene butadiene, and styrene maleic anhydride copolymers. The neoalkoxy compounds also improve the dimensional stability of shaped resins. This is reflected by reduced water absorption in humid environments, and is amply demonstrated by the examples hereinafter set forth. Other positive effects in certain filled plastics include improved conductivity, a reflection of the improved dispersion of the conductive filler in the polymer flame retardancy, a result of the exclusion of air from the interstices of the resin and better filler dispersion less heat distortion and catalytic effects. Data for all of these effects are given in the examples which follow. The solvent stability of the neoalkoxy compounds, as mentioned previously, is also a marked advantage over the prior art. The prior art hydrolyzable groups reacted with many solvents, thereby destroying the efficacy of the organo titanate as a coupling agent. Examples of solvents which quickly deactivated the prior art coupling agents are protonated solvents, such as hydroxylated polymers, vicinal glycols both monomeric and polymeric , solvents which exhibit keto enol tautomerism, organic acids, esters, isocyanates and carboxylates. In the case of the neoalkoxy compounds of the invention, however, they are substantially non reactive at the processing temperatures of most polymeric materials. The resistance to protonated solvents, accordingly, improves the shelf stability of polymeric compositions containing the neoalkoxy compounds. Rather than being useful for just minutes after blending with the resin, stability can now be extended for weeks. Actually, this is of substantial advantage in using the organo titanates or organo zirconates of the invention as coupling agents, rather than the conventional primary, secondary and tertiary alkoxy type. The reaction product of the neoalkoxy compounds and fillers are a further embodiment of the instant invention. Generally speaking at least 0.01 part, preferably from 0.1 to 5 parts by weight of the neoalkoxy compound are used to treat each 100 parts of filler. Most preferable is the reaction of from 0.2 to 2 parts per 100 parts of filler. A wide variety of fillers may be treated these include both organic and inorganic material. These materials may be particulate or fibrous and of varied shape or size, so long as the surfaces are reactive with the hydrolyzable groups of the organotitanium compound.Examples of inorganic reinforcing materials include metals, clay, carbon black, calcium carbonate, barium sulfate, silica, mica, glass and asbestos. Reactive inorganic materials include the metal oxides of zinc, magnesium, lead, and calcium and aluminum, iron filings and turnings, and sulfur. Examples of inorganic pigments include titanium dioxide, iron oxides, zinc chromate, ultramarine blues. Organic materials include carbon black, carbon fibers, nylon fibers, polytetrafluoroethylene, cellulosics and organic pigments. As a practical matter, the particle size of the inorganic materials should not be greater than 1 mm, preferably from 0.1 micron to 500 micron. It is imperative that the neoalkoxy compound be properly admixed with the inorganic material to permit the surface of the latter to react sufficiently. The optimum amount of the neoalkoxy compound to be used is dependent on the effect to be achieved, the available surface area of and the bonded water in the inorganic material. Reaction is facilitated by admixing under the proper conditions.Optimum results depend on the properties of the alkoxy compound, namely, whether it is a liquid or solid, and its decomposition and flash points. The particle size, the geometry of the particles, the specific gravity, the chemical composition, among other things, must be considered. Additionally, the treated inorganic material must be thoroughly admixed with the polymeric medium. The appropriate mixing conditions depend on the type of polymer, whether it is thermoplastic or thermosetting, its chemical structure, etc., as will be readily understood by those skilled in the art. Where the inorganic material is pretreated with the organic titanate or zirconate, it may be admixed in any convenient type of intensive mixer, such as a Henschel or Hobart mixer or a Waring blender. Even hand mixing may be employed. The optimum time and temperature are determined to obtain substantial reaction between the inorganic material and the organic metalate. Mixing is performed under conditions at which the organic metalate is in the liquid phase, at temperatures below the decomposition temperature. While it is desirable that the bulk of the hydrolyzable groups be reacted in this step, this is not essential where the materials are later admixed with a polymer, since the substantial completion of the reaction may take place in this latter mixing step. Polymer processing, e.g., high shear mixing, is generally performed at a temperature well above the second order transition temperature of the polymer, desirably at a temperature where the polymer will have a low melt viscosity. For example, low density polyethylene is best processed at a temperature range of 1700 to 2300C high density polyethylene from 2000 to 2450C polystyrene from 2300 to 260 C polypropylene from 2300 to 2900C thermoplastic polyesters from 260 to 2800C polyamides from 2600 to 3200C and polycarbonates from 230 to 2550C. Temperatures for mixing other polymers are known to those skilled in the art and may be determined by reference to existing literature.A variety of mixing equipment may be used, e.g., two roll mills, Banbury mixers, double concentric screws, counter or co rotating twin screws and ZSK type of Werner and Pfaulder and Busse mixers. When the organic metalate and the inorganic materials are dry blended, thorough mixing and or reaction is not readily achieved and the reaction may be substantially completed when the treated filler is admixed with the polymer. In this latter step, the organic metalate may also react with the polymeric material if one or more of the A groups is reactive with the polymer. The treated filler may be incorporated in any of the conventional polymeric materials, whether thermoplastic or thermosetting, whether rubber or plastic. The amount of filler depends on the particular polymeric material, the filler and property requirements of the finished product. Broadly, from 10 to 500 parts of filler may be used per 100 parts of polymer, preferably from 20 to 250 parts.The optimum amount may be readily determined by one skilled in the art with the assistance of the following dosage table Coupling Agent, wt. basedSubstrate Class Substrate Type on SubstratePolymers Organic Inorganic All types 0.1 0.3Silicas Mineral Sand, Quartz 0.2 Novaculite 0.3 Diatomaceous Earth 0.6 Synthetics Precipitated Silica Reinf. 0.6 Fumed Colloidal Silica 0.8 Silica Aerogel 0.8Silicates Mineral Soft, Hard, Calcined Clay 0.3 Mica, Talc 0.3 Wollastonite, Perlite, Asbestos 0.4 Synthetics Calcium Silicate 0.6 Aluminum Silicate 0.4Calcium Carbonate Calcite, Dolomite 0.2 0.5 Precipitated 0.5Metals Plate All Metals 0.2 0.5 Powder All Metals 0.2 0.4 Oxides Iron, Zinc, Lead, Chromium, Zirconium, Ti, Al, Mg, etc. 0.2 0.4 Peroxides Lead Zinc 0.3 0.5 Hydrates Aluminum, etc. 0.2 0.4 Acetates, Hydroxides All Types 0.2 0.4 Sulfates, Nitrates All Types 0.2 0.4 Sulfides Zn, etc. 0.2 0.4 Borates Ba, Zn 0.1 0.5Carbon Black Pigment, Reinf., Conductive 0.5 2.0Fibers Fiberglass 0.2 0.3 Coupling Agent, wt. based Substrate Class Substrate Type on SubstrateFibers Aramide Kevlar 0.2 0.3 Graphite 0.1 0.8 Polybenzamidazole 0.2 0.3 Potassium Titanate 0.2 0.4 PAN 0.1 0.3 Carbon PAN based 0.2 1.0Cellulosics Wood Flour 0.5 2.0Sulfur Vulcanization Grade 0.3 0.5Pigments Chromates Lead Chromate 0.2 0.3 Molybdate Orange 0.2 0.3 Chromate Green 0.2 0.3 Ferriferrocyanide Iron Blue 0.3 0.5 Monoazo Tol.Red, etc. 0.3 0.5 Lithol Lithol Red 0.3 0.5 Rubine Rubine Red 0.3 0.5 Phthalo Blue, Green 0.4 0.6 Oxides TiO2 0.4 0.6 Iron 0.2 0.4 As mentioned previously, because of the outstanding heat stability of the neoalkoxy compounds, it is unnecessary to first treat the filler in order to obtain the benefits of the neoalkoxy compounds as coupling agents, since their stability at high temperatures permits the blending of each of the three components separately in a single operation. In the case of the prior art organo titanate, where the blending of the polymer and filler required high temperature, high shear mixing, the addition of the three components at once would have resulted in the decomposition of the hydrolyzable group and the destruction of the coupling effect. In order to further illustrate the subject invention, the following examples are provided. Examples 1 through show the preparation of various neoalkoxy compounds of the invention. Example 4 shows the relative solvolytic stability. The balance of the examples are directed towards the use of the neoalkoxy compounds in resins, showing both filled and unfilled resin systems Example 1 TITANIUM IV 2,2 DIMETHYL PROPANOLATO,TRIS DIOCTYL PHOSPHATOD To a glass vessel equipped with a mechanical agitator, external heating and cooling, vapor condensation means, a distillate trap and off gas scrubber was added one mole of 2,2 dimethylpropanol and three moles of dioctyl hydrogen phosphate as well as two liters of mixed isomer xylene.The reactor was flushed with nitrogen and maintained under a slow nitrogen purge during the addition of one mole of titanium tetrachloride over a period of two hours. External heating and cooling was supplied, as necessary, to maintain the operating temperature in the range of 45 600C. After the addition of the titanium tetrachloride, nitrogen purge was slighly accelerated for an additional two hours followed by evaporation of the reaction mixture in vacuo to produce a bottoms fraction boiling above 1500 C. Elemental analysis of the moderately viscous red brown residual oil was consistent with its formulation as C5HllTitOP O OC8Hl7 2 . The off gas scrubber contents were analyzed to show that approximately 4 moles of hydrogen chloride had been captured in the caustic scrubbing solution.Subsequent high pressure liquid chromatography HLPC analysis of a portion of bottoms product was used to determine product yield employing a Fourier transform infrared detector system FTIR for quantification of effluent assay.

In addition, the coupling agents of the instant invention also selectively improve the physical propertlesi of the reinforced polyester.Example 37 PEROXIDE CURED CaCO3 FILLED POLYESTER Formulations were prepared containing 30 parts by weight of a synthetic marble mix polyester resin Stypol 40 5727, FreemanChemical 70 parts of calcium carbonate in the form of ground marble dust Micro White 50, Sylacauga 0.5 part of a catalyst comprising methylethyl ketone peroxide and 0.2 part of the additives shown below, added to the resin prior to the addition of the marble dust.The compositions were cured at ambient temperature and their physical properties measured.

The above data clearly show that the neoc koxy titanates tend to retard the cure of the polyester, while the neoalkoxy zirconates function as accelerators. The additives of the invention improve the tensile strength and the compressive strength of the formulations in most instances. Example 38 PEROXIDE CURED POLYESTER CLEAR COAT Formulations containing 100 parts by weight of polyester resin Hetron 700C, Ashland Chemical Co. 0.5 part of nethylethyl ketone peroxide catalyst and 0.4 part of the additives shown in the table below were cured at ambient temperature.

Certain of these tinates substantially prevent the curing of the material, while others merely retard the reaction.In contrast, each and every one of the neoalkoxy zirconates tested markedly accelerated the tire to gel and the cure time. Furthermore, the elongation to break of the compounds cured in the presence of the neoalkoxy zirconates shows that higher molecular weights were achieved. Substantial improvements in notched Izod values and, in certain instances, flexural strength and tensile strength, are also apparent.

Improvements are also shown in selective additives, particularly for the zirconates, in the tensile strength and HTD value.

All of the neoalkoxy titanates, however, selectively increase the physical strength of the polyester compound.Example 42 CURED POLYESTER CLEAR COAT In this example, compositions containing 100 parts by weight of polyester resin Aropol 7362, Ashland , 0.5 part of methylethyl ketone peroxide, and 0.2 part of the additives shown below were cured at ambient temperature and post cured for 24 hours at 50 CC.
