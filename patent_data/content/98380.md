# Friction spinning apparatus.

## Abstract
A friction spinning apparatus comprises two rollers 1, 2 in closely spaced parallel arrangement which define between them a yarn formation zone at an elongate gap along the rollers and a feed duct 41 which extends into the gap so as to feed fibres directly into the gap in such a manner that they can fall directly onto the yarn 419 . The feed duct comprises two parts 415, 416 one 415 of which includes a planar portion defining a side wall of the fibre feed passage along the duct and the other 416 of which is a complex part defining the opposite side wall as well as end walls which in the assembled fibre feed duct extend between the opposite side walls.
