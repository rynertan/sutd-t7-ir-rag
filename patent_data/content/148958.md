# TAPERING METHOD FOR WIRE CUT ELECTRIC DISCHARGE MACHINING.

## Abstract
A tapering method for use in, for example, wire cut electric discharge machining, in which any desired truncated cone shaped machined surface is inserted between first and second tapered surfaces TP₁, TP₂ adjacent to each other such as to be smoothly continuous therewith. The passage
