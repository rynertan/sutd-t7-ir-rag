# Method and device for cleaning carpets.

## Abstract
A container 12 has a first section 18 in which is mounted a distributing roller 20 and which has a brush 22 on its end. A second section 16 is attached to a handle 14 and an open cleaning powder container 29 is slid into the second section. The roller 20 distributes the powder on the carpet. The device is then turned over so that the brush 22 can be used to scrub in the powder which is then vacuumed up.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A carpet cleaning device comprising a hollow container having first and second sections 18, 16 at an angle to each other, a powder transfer roller 20 rotatably mounted in the first section, a brush 22 mounted on the first section, a handle 14 on the second section and a device 34 for holding a disposable powder container 29 in the second section in communication with the powder transfer roller. 2. A device according to claim 1, wherein the roller 20 has a rough or porous surface. 3. A device according to claim 2, wherein the surface of the roller 20 is a reticulated foam. 4. A device according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the holding device includes a clip 34 and wing nut 36 arrangement engaging a powder container 29 slid into the second section 16 . 5. A device according to claim 1, 2 or 3, wherein the holding device is an elastic noose 38 on the powder container 29 that slides over the handle 14 . 6. A method of cleaning a carpet comprising the steps of depositing a cleaning powder on the carpet by rotating a cleaning roller into contact with the surface, brushing the powder on the surface and vacuuming up the powder. CLAIMS 1. A device for cleaning a floor surface, comprising a handle for pushing the device along the floor, a hollow container for a cleaning agent at the lower end of the handle, a distributing roller in the lower part of the container for spreading the cleaning agent, and a brush mounted on a support projecting at an angle from the container such that, in a first orientation of the device, only the roller contacts the floor surface whereas in a second orientation of the device the brush contacts the floor surface, characterised in that, in the first orientation the bristles of the brush C22 project substantially horizontally from a substantially vertical wall at the end of the support 18 and, in the second orientation the said wall is substantially horizontal and the roller 20 is raised away from the floor surface. 2. A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the roller 20 has a rough or porous surface for distributing a carpet cleaning powder. 3. A device according to claim 2, characterised in that the roller C20 surface is of reticulated foam.

## Description
CARPET CLEANING DEVICE This invention relates to a carpet cleaning device which can be used by a housewife, for example, to clean a carpet in situ. Recently, a new approach to cleaning carpets has been developed which uses a powdered cleaning composition containing a mixture of extremely porous solid particles and a solvent. This new cleaning composition is described inU.S. Patent Specification 4,013,594 and has proved especially effective in removing dirt. Further, only a short interval is required between application and removal of the powered cleaning composition. Using this new cleaning composition, it has now become possible to clean wall to wall carpets in offices, shops and residences wit little disruption of normal affairs. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a lightweight, low cost carpet cleaner which uses a powdered cleaning composition to clean carpets in situ. The invention is defined in claim 1 below. Because the two sections of the container are at an angle to each other, the device can be used in two orientations, in one of which the roller faces down to contact the carpet and in the other of which it is the brush which faces down. The invention will be described in more detail, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIGURE 1 is a side view of the carpet cleaner in the powder distribution position FIGURE 2 is a view taken on line 2 2 of Figure 1 FIGURE 3 is a side view of the carpet cleaner in the cleaning position and FIGURE 4 illustrates a modification of the carpet power container and its mounting in the carpet cleaner. In Figures 1 and 2, a carpet cleaner 10 comprises a hollow container 12 and a handle 14. The container 12 consists of a powder support section 16 and a cleaning section 18 at an angle to the powder support section 16. The cleaning section 18 has a roller 20 with a rough or porous surface, such as a reticulated foam roller, rotatably mounted therein in communication with the powder support section 16, and a brush 22 mounted on the end thereof. The handle 14 is secured to the back 24 of the powder support portion 16 by a pair of U shaped clips 26 and screws 28. The powder dispenser 29 is a disposable container, which is opened at one end and slid do nard into the powder support section 16 until it engages flanges 30 at the bottom of the hollow powder support portion 16 adjacent the roller 20. In Figures 1 3, the bottom 32 of the powder dispenser 29 is flanged and is engaged by a clip 34 which is secured to the handle 14 by wing nut 36. In the embodiment shown inFigure 4, the flanged bottom 32 is eliminated and an integral elastic cord or wire noose 38 is slid over the handle 14. Th.en the carpet cleaner 10 is to be used, the powder container 29 is opened, inverted and placed in the hollow powder section 16 and secured to the handle 14, as in Figure 3 or 4. The cleaner 10 is then placed rollerdown Figure 1 on the carpet 36 to be cleaned and pushed over the carpet by the handle 14. The roller 20 rotates to deposit cleaning powder from the container 29 on to the carpet.when the carpet 36 has been covered with powder, the cleaner 10 is turned over Figure 3 and the brush 22 is used to scrub the powder into the carpet to loosen the dirt which, along with powder, is cleaned up afterwards by a vacuum cleaner.
