## Description
A PORTABLE UNIT This invention relates to a portable unit in which a desired pressure may be maintained, for example for the recovery of divers suffering from the bends. When resurfacing rapidly, a diver is at risk of suffering from the bends, caused by the rapid decrease in pressure to which his body is subjected as he rises to the surface of the water. The diver who suffers from the bends under water is at a great risk of his condition deteriorating as he continues to rise to the surface of the water to be transferred for treatment. Presently, many underwater operations are conducted using rigid diving bells which must be lifted up from, or lowered to, the sea bed with a crane or similar lifting device. Such bells are heavy and inflexibleswhich makes them difficult to manoeuvre and awkward to handle both on land and underwater. According to the present invention there is provided a portable unit in which a desired pressure may be maintained and which is capable of transporting therein person, the unit comprising a flexible body for housing the person, the body having an entrance forming a hatchway, and a rigid hatch cover for sealing the hatchway, the unit being provided with an inlet for compressed gas and a valve whereby the pressure in the unit may be regulated. The unit of the invention may be submerged to the depth of the diver, who is placed inside the unit.The unit is then sealed and air is dein from a demand valve to be discharged into the unit. The required pressure, according to the depth at which the unit is submerged ,may then be set in the unit by means of an adjustable release valve. The air discharged from the demand valve into the unit then causes water in the unit to leave via the release valve. As a result of the buoyancy of the air, the unit ascends to the surface of the water maintaining the preset pressure. When the unit has surfaced, air may be discharged fron the and valve to e pel any water fran within the unit so that the unit may be transferred with the diver inside. The unit may also be used to transfer a suffering diver for treatment on land. For a better understanding of the present invention, and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Figures 1 and 2 are an end view and side view of the assembled unit, respectively Figures 3, 4 and 5 are a front, reverse and side view respectively of a hatch cover used to seal the entrance of the diving unit Figures 6 to 10 illustrate the entrance of the diving unit at various stages during its construction Figure 11 is a cross section of the hatch cover of Figures 3 to 5, also showing, in cross section, part of the entrance of the unit Figure 12 is a partial cross section of the entrance of the diving unit and Figure 13 is a cross section of the hatch cover in place in the entrance.
