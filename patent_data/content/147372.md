# DEVICE FOR ATTACHING A BEARING IN A BEARING HOLDER

## Abstract
In a device for attaching a bearing 12 in a bearing holder 10 , preferably an end shield bearing bracket in an electric machine, the bearing is fitted in a cut out 11 in the bearing holder. The bearing 12 is secured against rotational movement relative to the bearing holder by means of a ring 22 of elastic material which is disposed in a groove 18 in the bearing holder so as to be clamped between the bearing and the bottom 21 of the groove. The groove 18 is so positioned that the elastic ring 22 also exerts an axially directed force on the bearing 12 .
