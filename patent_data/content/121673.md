# Turbomolecular vacuum pump.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a turbomolecular vacuum pump 1 of the type having stator blades 10 which are disposed in multistage fashion within a casing 2 and in the axial direction thereof, and rotor blades 11 which are located between the respectively adjacent stator blades 10 and which are disposed on the outer periphery of a rotor 12 situated centrally of the casing 2 . A motor rotor 17 is fixed to a rotating member 5 which is formed of the rotor 12 having the rotor blades 11 fixed to its outer periphery, and a motor stator 18 opposite to the motor rotor 17 is ar ranged to construct the drive mechanism of the rotating member 5 . The rotating member 5 is supported at its lower part by a pivot type plain bearing 15 . A magnetic bearing 20 is arranged in a manner to oppose between the lower end of the rotor 12 and a supporting member 6 for the rotating member 5 .
