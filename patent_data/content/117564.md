# Rotary type heat exchanger.

## Abstract
A rotary type heat exchanger comprises a rotor having heat insulation in the direction of its diameter, a casing for said rotor, an entrance of said casing to guide the high tem perature incoming gas to be used for the heat exchange ex clusively toward said rotor except for the outer periphery thereof and the areas close to the shaft of said rotor, a heat insulation being treated on the inner wall of said entrance, a sealing member for high temperature being provided on the side toward said rotor of said entrance to keep the gas leak age minimum, an exhaust gas outlet of said casing being provided on the side opposing to said entrance to guide all the exhaust gas passed through said rotor to outside, a sealing member being provided on the side toward said ro tor of said exhaust gas outlet to keep the gas leakage min imum, an outer fresh gas inlet of said casing to guide outer fresh gas into said casing, an outlet port of said casing be ing provided on the side opposing to said outer fresh gas in let to guide the heated gas in said rotor to outside, and a heat insulation being treated on the inner wall of said outlet port.
