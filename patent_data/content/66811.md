# Multi component glass optical fiber for optical communication and glasses therefor.

## Abstract
There is provided a multi component system glass fiber for optical communication which comprises glass for the core having a composition comprising SiO₂, BaO, Al₂O₃, B₂O₃, at least one alkali metal oxide selected from Na₂O, K₂O and Li₂O, and at least one alkaline earth metal oxide selected from MgO and CaO in specified amounts, and a glass for the clad layer having a composition comprising SiO₂, Al₂O₃, B₂O₃, at least one alkali metal oxide selectec from Na₂O₃, K₂O, Li₂O, at least one alkaline earth metal oxide selected from MgO and CaO and at least one of ZnO, ZrO₂ and TiO₂ in specified amounts. The core in the glass fiber for optical communication according to the present invention shows lower optical loss and the clad layer shows high weathering resistance, and the glass fiber according to the present invention suffers from no devitrification during fiber drawing and is excellent in dimensional stability. Figure 4 shows an example of optical loss characteristics of a fiber constituted according to the invention.
