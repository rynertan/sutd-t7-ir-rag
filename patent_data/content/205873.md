# Method for processing an expert system rulebase segmented into contextual units.

## Abstract
Method for processing the Rulebase of an expert system on a data processing system in which the Rulebase is segmented into a plurality of contextual units, each one having a size less than the size of the system memory and a plurality of Goal trees with a Goal node at its root and a plurality of other nodes at the leaves of the tree. When the Rulebase is segmented, it is then possible to eliminate portions of the Rulebase containing data or knowledge that is not needed in a particular application. The segmenting of the Rule base also allows the expert system to be run with systems or on systems having much smaller memory capacities than was possible with prior art arrangements since each segment of the Rulebase can be paged into and out of the system as needed.
