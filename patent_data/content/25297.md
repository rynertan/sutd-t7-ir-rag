# Improvements in electrical machines.

## Abstract
An alternating current electrical machine construction in which a primary winding is modified to create transient elec tromagnetic conditions for example by having at least two distinct values of pole pitch. In a linear induction motor a first pole pitch portion STAL is followed by a sec ond portion STAA of shorter pole pitch. When an inductively coupled solid rotor passes from first to second rotor currents memorised from the first, propulsion, section cause current in the second, recovery section. This current can be of unity or leading power factor. Appropriate winding design permits the operation of the machine using an inverter LCIA without making provision for reactive power supply. Part of the machine winding, the recovery section, functions as an asyn chronous condenser ASCA to cope with the reactive power components In a cylindrical machine the winding modification can provide transient creating pole or part pole windings controlling the quadrature flux component.

## Description
IA2ROVEFlENTS IN ELECTRICAL MACHINES This invention relates to electrical machines, and more particularly to brushless machines such as linear and cylindrical induction machines for operation on alternating current. In electrical machines energy is wasted in various ways including friction, winding resistance and eddy currents. Such losses can be minimised by careful design of the mechanical aspects of the machine and by correct choice of constructional materials There is however another defect which is related more to the nature of the electrical effects by which the machine operates. This defect is identified with a quantity called the power factor. The current and voltage in the machine are moved out of phase with one another resulting in an imaginary or reactive power component of the electrical energy involved.This reactive component cannot produce a useful output from the machine so it reduces the real power available in the machine, reducing the efficiency of both the machine and the associated electrical transmission path and increasing the construction and operating costs of both. Despite these disadvantages the simple, robust construction of induction machines has led to their widespread use with the acceptance of this cost penalty.Clearly with increasing material and manufacturing costs this penalty is less acceptable. Induction motors are generally cylindrical and symmetrical but motors have been proposed and occasionally made with a rotor only partly encircled by an arcuate stator. Such machines are Icnown as arch motors or motors with an open magnetic circuit . The partial stator introduces asymmetry into the electrical and magnetic states which is distinct from the symmetry of a conventional cyclindrical machine. Professor Sir FredericWilliams analysed these states Proc. I.E.E. 104A 1957 p.102 and 106A 1959 p.471 .A conventional induction motor has a lagging power factor with a stator current pattern travelling at synchronous speed and induced printed in the rotor an identical pattern also travelling at synchronous speed but displaced in the direction of motion in dependence on the ratio of load current to magnetising current. This ratio is the lZGoodness Goodness Factor of the machine and should be as high as possible. Professor Williams suggested for the arch motor a second induced current pattern in the rotor due to transients on the entry of unmagnetised rotor material under the leading edge of the stator and identical to the stator current pattern but travelling at rotor speed.Figure 1, which is similar to Figure 12 of the first of the above references, illustrates the analysis on p.108 of this reference. Figure 1 is a plot of flux in the stator rotor gap against distance along the gap normalized as radians in terms of pole pitch and slip to be independent of any particular machine condition. The flux level marked ECM is that of the steady state in phase flux of an equivalent conventional machine .The two flux components drift in and out of phase during rotation of the rotor producing the Bp and Bq curves shown in Figure 1. It should be emphasised that these curves relate to a perfect machine, i.e. one requiring zero magnetising currents and having zero magnetic leakage.The area under the Bp curve is a measure of the useful power output of the machine as a motor. The maximum machine efficiency occurs at on the distance axis. The area in quadrants III and IV between Bp and ECM represents a reduction in electrical losses in comparison with a conventional machine. The maximum power factor occurs at a slip distance product of 2 and in fact from the equal graph areas on either side of the axis appears to be unity. The ECM level of Bq is zero, i.e. the distance axis. Prior to reaching 2 athe power factor which is the integral of the Bq waveform is always lagging and at 27 the air gap power factor is unity.The second current pattern leads to higher rotor losses than in a cylindrical machine, indicated by the area above the Bp curve but below ECM. Also on exit from the stator back torques arise when the magnetised rotor teeth continue to move from beneath the final energised stator blocks, again leading to transients which result in further losses. In particular a perfect arch machine, i having no leakage flux and drawing no magnetising current would still draw reactive volt amperes from the supply whenever the region between the Bq curve and the axis has more positive area than negative area, resulting in lower, i.e. poorer, power factor. The amount of reactive power is indicated by the value of the power factor. This is unity when reactive power is not being drawn. Fihen reactive power is drawn the power factor is less than unity. The higher the proportion of reactive power the lower the power factor.Inductive loads, typically induction motors, have a lagging power factor between 1.0 and zero while capacitive loads, which are very rare, have a leading power factor between 1.0 and zero and can offset inductive loads on a common supply. Accordingly the arch motor, and open magnetic machines in general, are at a disadvantage, apart from applications where other properties outweigh this poor power factor disadvantage. Reference has been made to stators and rotors above but as the terms are not always clearly identifiable with machine parts the terms primary and secondary will be used respectively to identify that machine part connected to a supply of electricity and that part coupled to the primary by electromagnetic effects. Where the term winding , is used this includes a solid element of the type found in some linear motors. The term machine extends to both generators and motors. It is an object of the invention to provide an electrical machine in which transient states exist aut which has a better power factor than the equivalent conventional machine and which preferably is at about unity or even leading. According to the invention there is provided an alternating current electrical machine having a first winding and a second winding as hereinbefore defined both of electrically conductive material and supported for relative motion with a flux permeable gap between them, one winding being arranged to create and maintain along the gap at least one transient to different electrical and or magnetic field conditions across the gap, without requiring a change in the frequency of the alternatIng current applied to the machine, the arrangement being such that in operation with said relative motion of the windings the transient to different conditions results in a change of effective field speed along said gap and the first and second windings there interact to produce in the one winding negative reactive volt amperes i.e. alternating current of the applied frequency at a leading power factor . Conveniently in a brushless electrical machine having a wound, uniformly slotted, stator and a uniform rotor the stator winding includes one part wound to one pole pitch and another part wound to a shorter pole pitch to provide in operation a stator field pattern decelerating with respect to the rotor when moving steadily from the longer towards the shorter pole pitch past that part of the stator. In this arrangement the alternating field from the energised one stator part imprinted on the rotor excites a reactive current in the other, shorter pole pitch, stator part at a phase advanced with respect to that of the energised one part. Modifications of the primary winding can provide a modified phase relation between adjacent poles. The production of negative reactive volt amperes can be enhanced by changing the number of turns per coil in the winding. The modification of the pole phase relation and or pitch can be achieved by a fixed winding form. The modification can also be achieved by control of the quadrature flux component of one or more transientcreating pole or part pole primary windings spaced around the stator of a cylindrical machine to control the effective width of a region of transient electromagnetic conditions. Advantageously there is provided an electrical machine system including such an electrical machine providing therein an asynchronous condenser winding arranged to recover reactive power during the operation of the machine, thereby improving the efficiency of the machine. The system may include an inverter to supply the machine with alternating current at a fixed or variable frequency, the asynchronous condenser permitting operation with reactive power despite the inability of the inverter to provide reactive power. The system may be arranged so that the asynchronous condenser winding provides a filter for unwanted harmonics. Embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a graph relating to an explanation of effects already observed in electrical machines Figure 2 shows a primary winding layout according to the invention for a primary stator of a linear induction motor Figure 3 shows a plot of coil voltage phase angles for some coils of one phase of the stator in Figure 2 Figure 4 shows a further winding layout according to the invention Figure 5 shows a plot of coil voltage phase angle for some coils of all phases of the stator of Figure 1 in a modified connection arrangement Figure 6 shows a prior art connection arrangement for a 10,000 HP linear induction motor Figures 7a and 7b show constructional 6a and circuit 6b details of a variable speed arrangement embodying the invention Figures 8a and 8b show in outline the distribution of types of primary stator winding in linear and cylindrical machines embodying the invention Figure 9 shows in outline another such winding distribution embodying the invention for a cylindrical machine Figure 10 shows the primary stator winding details for a 10 pole squirrel cage motor conforming to the outline in Figure 9 Figures lia and lIb show a connection arrangement embodying the invention Figure 12 shows such a winding diagram for a motor including s.c.r. devices in the winding and Figures 13 and 14 show graphs useful in explaining the behaviour of machines such as are shown in Figures 9 and 10. The invention will be described as applied to a linear induction motor. This machine form is not necessarily a preferred embodiment but is a convenient form of operating and analysing the invention. As described below the invention is applicable to various machine forms and the exact machine form is not part of the invention. Figure 2 shows the winding layout of a stator ST for a short primary stator single sided linear induction motor having a secondary rotor RO of aluminium sheet inch 9.5 mm thick and backed by a steel sheet 5 inch 19 mm thick. The aluminium is tungsten inert gas welded to ensure electrical continuity and prevent rotor induced transients. The stator faces the aluminium with a small air gap preferably in the range of 1 10 inch 2.5 mm to 1 25 inch 1 mm . The stator and rotor are both shown symbolically in Figure 1 and mould be of several suitable constructional forms. The stator block is 42 feet 1.46 m long and has 54 slots 14.3 mm wide by 38.1 mm deep on a 27 mm pitch.48 coils with 12 turns per coil were wound on to the stator and connected as shown in Figure 2. The connections provide three different field speeds when energised with a singlefrequency 3 phase supply in the sequence R Y B. The phases are indicated in Figure 2 by the respective letters R, Y andB. In the winding coils 1 to 22, section 1, provide three poles at pole pitch Tp1 of 0.2025 m coils 23 to 40, section 2, also provide three poles but at a pitch Tp2 of 0.162 m and coils 41 to 48 provide two poles at a pitchTp3 of 0108 m. For a given energisation frequency the field speed of section 2 is 80 of that of section 1 while for section 3 it is 53.3, 0 of that of section 1. The decelerating field pattern is a feature of one aspect of the invention. As the slip varies the effect of sections 2 and 3 will change. Thus by way of example at a slip of 0.5 for section 1 the construction produces a slip of 0.375 for section 2 and 0.062 for section 3, all three sections giving some forward thrust to the rotor. However at a slip of 0.25 for section 1 the slip of section 2 is apparently 0.062 and for section 3 is apparently 0.406, i.e. section 3 is apparently a power generator. However it must be remembered that the whole of the pole surface is operating under transient conditions at all times.Thus it must not be assumed that an apparent negative s lip, say for section 3, implies a reversed thrust. It is precisely this combination of conditions and slip that accumulation of leading reactive volt amperes begins, substantially without loss of thrust. The effect of the machine structure according to the inVention that is achieved can be represented on Figure 1. Instead of the continuously repeating cycle of flux values known hitherto Bp can be held at the ECM level value and Bq at the negative peak value. The cyclic curves then become horizontal lines not shown at these values indicating the action of the invention in changing the nature of machine operation. These lines also indicate the production of useful power between Bp and the axis and the accumulation of leading reactive volt amperes beneath the axis down to BRq . This continuous recovery of leading reactive power is an important advantage and hitherto unobtainable action which permits the offsetting of the lagging reactive power of the propulsion portion of the machine. The machine described was tested with all coils in series connection and energised at 50 Hz. Sections 2 and 3 can be considered as forming a generator of reactive volt amperes VAR , i.e. out of phase, which operates without significant braking thrust, while section 1 provides propulsive thrust drawing power from the supply at a lagging power factor. Each stator tooth, i.e. within each coil, had a search coil to permit measurement of tooth flux at slot pitch resolution. The search coils were in 0.5 mm grooves in the centre of each tooth face. Figure 3 shows a plot of coil current phase angles for the B phase at 50 Hz and 0.218 slip.The angles range from 280 to 1560. However none of the coils actually had a leading power factor, probably because all had equal ampere turns, all the coils being similar. To permit an estimate of a better winding arrangement for sections 2 and 3 a shunting loop of virtually zero impedance was applied. Figure 4 shows this at OSH. Coils 23, 25 and 27 of Figure 2 were each connected directly to a floating star point, switches being included to enable the loop to be opened and closed. The machine was then operated with the same excitation and mains current as above. The light running speed was higher, the overall power factor was improved by 3098 taking account of the recoverable reactive power and, most importantly, 9 coils in winding section 2 showed leading power factors on measurements with two independent devices, viz an electronic phase meter and a moving coil VAR meter to eliminate the possibility of a spurious measurement. Figure 5 shows power factor angle plots for the coils of sections 2 and 3 coils 23 48 . Coils 23 to 31 all had leading power factors. Additionally 5 coils in section 1 had phase angles of 45 to 48 indicating a lagging power factor of 0.7 which is about 8 better than for the basic machine, while coils close to the section 1 section 2 transition showed phase angles of 300 to 400 indicating a potential power factor of 0.86 for total machine current.The voltage phasors in Figure 5 are distributed among all four quadrants whereas in a conventional rotary machine all would be in one qudrant. Tize phasor pattern was displaced bodily, showing an improvement in overall power factor, at higher values of mains current. The action of the machine in this connection arrangement is to strongly couple section 1 to isolated sections 2 and 3 via the sheet rotor which provides a secondary circuit. The coupling permits the magnetisation of the stator core of isolated coil sections 2 and 3 by rotor currents only and the continuous production of leading power factor current in these coil sections purely by electromagnetic induction from a brushless rotor. Practical applications of the invention demonstrated by the above tests are exemplified below. Figure 6 shows a common, prior art, arrangement for operating a 10,000 HP linear induction motor from a variable voltage variablefrequency semi conductor controlled rectifier inverter.Reactive power cannot pass through the inverter and is supplied wholly by the d.c. field synchronous condenser.Some 90 goes to the motor and 10 ó to commutate the inverter. In detail a constant current d.c. source, CCDC, supplies a line commutated square wave inverter, LCI, to operate the linear induction motor, LIM, and the synchronous condenser, DCSC, which is in parallel with the seriesconnected LINT. The condenser DCSC additionally provides an effective harmonic filter. The synchronous condenser has a d.c. excited rotor DRF. The invention permits a significant simplification and improvement of the prior art arrangement of Figure 6. By using the currents in the rotor no, induced by section 1 of the windings of the stator ST in Figure 1, a magnetisation field to replace that of the d.c. energised rotor field DRF of Figure 6 can be produced. This field is applied to sections 2 and 3 of the stator ST which can now be considered as the stator windings of the synchronous condenser DCSC.In this arrangement the condenser is conveniently considered to be asyrichronous ia.s.c. . Thus the test described with the zero impedance connection of coils 23, 25, 27 can represent the provision of an asynchronous condenser with coils effectively in parallel with the stator section 1 of a linear induction motor. The zero impedance connection is then a way of avoiding the practical problem of matching stator section impedance levels for actual parallel connection. In this way the overall power factor can be improved. An approximation to the matched impedance is provided by either adjustable complex impedances or a feedbackcontrolled s.c.r. mark space ratio phase retarder in place of the zero impedance loop. A further advantage to machines embodying the invention to provide an a.s.c. is that the supply waveform need not be sinusoidal. A convenient and commonly used technique for variable speed drives is to use an induction motor energised from a variable frequency supply using s.c.r. inverter devices. The induction motor is usually a fixed pole type designed for a sinusoidal supply and unless very expensive complex inverters are used their output includes substantial square wave components. These cause square wave currents in the motor with excessive losses and unyielding harmonic torques. Clearly the Figure 6 prior art avoids these problems but requires a costly synchronous machine. The invention in one aspect provides a machine including an a.s.c. to act as filter of supply harmonics providing a substantially sinusoidal fundamental to the propulsive winding.The a.s.c. is provided by the modified part of the winding, e.g. sections 2 and or 3 above. The a.s.c. winding requires a significantly higher 50 Hz impedance than the propulsive winding at the energisation frequency. Desirably when the a.s.c. winding in combination with rotors of large inertia is used as an electromechanical current harmonic filter the a.s.c. winding offers maximum impedance to the fundamental while its lowest impedance can be designed to occur at the strongest harmonic which is usually the fifth in the case of a square wave inverter. Figure 7 shows at 7a a stator block STA and at Figure 7b an outline circuit for a variable speed arrangement of integrated machine LIMA and a.s.c. ASCA powered via a line i.e. a.s.c. commutated 6 s.c.r. bridge current source inverter LCIA .This arrangement is for a linear machine and eliminates the need for large commutation capacitors or an auxiliary synchronous machine. Also the weight and capital cost for a given rating will be reduced. The stator block STA has two slot regions, STAL at one uniform pitch for the linear machine and STAA at a shorter uniform pitch for the a.s.c. portion. The a.s.c. portion is of reducing iron section as the flux density falls as rotor currents decay t after leaving the linear machine portion. An important feature of the invention is that the frequency of the recovered electrical energy is the same as that supplied to the propulsion windings. The slip frequency from propulsion winding to rotor and back to recovery winding is offset by the higher field speed in the recovery winding to bring this about. This harmony of the machine frequency is important in that among other things it permits the recovered energy to be sent back into the supply if this is desired.Clearly the techniques described so far are applicable to cylindrical machines. Such a machine directly applying the techniques would require an unsymmetrical stator winding layout, in complete contrast to existing machine technology but although desirable an unsymmetrical slot layout is not essential to put the invention into effect. Details of such stators are considered below. In the primary stator arrangements described so far power factor has been improved by recovery of exit end power although the power factor of the propulsive, linear motor, part of the machine will still have the usual low power factor and excessive rotor ohmic losses albeit that these are at a reduced level. The constraint of exponential rise in air gap flux along the propulsion windings will remain, although mitigated by the above recovery, but the power factor can be improved. Another constraint is that the stator current loading in the a.s.c. generator portion must be less than in the propulsive portion for a leading power factor. In the embodiment now described the stator is further modified to improve the propulsive portion. Referring to the 48 coil stator STA of Figure 2 this is wound with coils 1 to 29 providing a 4 pole section of the same wavelength as the 3 pole section. Coils 39 to 48 are of a high impedance, while coils 30 to 38 are of a lower impedance, approximately one ninth that of coils 39 to 48, having one third the number of windings. Conveniently coils 30 to 38 are identical to coils 1 to 30. However coils 30 to 48 are parallel connected to coils 1 to 29 via an external phase shifter permitting a variable stator current ratio between the propulsive part, coils 1 to 29, and the a.s.c.part, coils 30 to 48. Clearly the two a.s.c. coil sets 30 to 38 and 39 to 48 are in the fixed ratio of 1 3. In this way the stator current loading Us , of the a.s.c. can differ from that of propulsive part J p and can also vary from coil to coil of the a.s.c. Conveniently for experimental use the phase shifter is an induction regulator. The change in stator current loading between propulsion and recovery windings is identified as a J jump , which is a term used herein to identify this technique. Series connection is possible. The regulator connection permits adjustment of machine conditions for different load conditions such as different mechanical loads and different machine terminal power factors. That is to say for differing balances of real and reactive powers resulting from the particular mode of the recovery section, if the mechanical load conditions are predictable and steady, e.g. a fan or pump, then a.s.c.windings star connected to a floating star point can be connected to appropriate tappings on the propulsive windings to achieve the required current reduction at the load despite any impedance mismatch. Start up is inefficient due to the a.s.c. but this does not matter for steadilyrunning equipment. This tapped connection provides a commercially attractive device without an induction regulator or s.c.r. inverter. Figure 8 compares in outline the allocation of propulsive and recovery portions or power and reactive portions in linear and cylindrical machines. Figure 8a is a linear machine with a stator STB and solid or sheet rotor ROB. Portion STEP of the stator has the propulsive winding applying power at a lagging power factor to the machine to drive the rotor. Portion STBR shaded of the stator has the recovery winding recovering reactive power from the rotor at least partly at a leading power factor to improve the overall power factor. It will be seen that the allocation of windings along the stator is relatively uncomplicated and segregated, recovery being by t end effect action as the rotor moves out from under the stator. The technique of a change in current loading described above can be applied within sections of the recovery winding if required. Figure 8b is a cylindrical machine, stator STC. The rotor ROC is not shown in detail but could conveniently be a conventional squirrel cage type. The rotor should however have a high ratio of magnetising, or demagnetising, inductance to rotor resistance to provide a good memory of applied flux during movement past the stator from propulsion to recovery portions. As in Figure 8a the large propulsive portions are shown unshaded while the smaller recovery portions are shaded. The propulsive flux distribution in the stator rotor air gap is also indicated by the varying spacing of the notional flux lines 5Ff . The linear machines described so far can be improved by the J jump technique of matching the recovery portion to the rotor to maximise leading power factor generation in the recovery windings, as mentioned above. However, implicit in J jump is the abrupt transition of air gap flux at the exit end of the stator. In rotary machines this must not be allowed to happen. Some form of distribution of the recovery winding along and or among the power winding is desirable. This alternative technique is identified herein by the term theta pinch and permits the construction of a stator with uniform pole pitch and nearly uniform stator current loading and flux in the air gap. It is convenient for manufacturing and design reasons to have a form of lumped a.s.c. winding although a fully distributed a.s.c. winding has some theoretical advantages. Both the J jump and theta pinch techniques described herein embody the invention and provide examples of constructional techniques for a.c. machine windings by means of which along a machine primary secondary gap a transient to a different field condition across the gap can be achieved. The invention is not limited to embodiments of one or other of these techniqucs but these have been found effective in putting the invention into practice. Figure 9 shows one possible distribution of the winding portions in a cylindrical machine with symmetrically spaced slots of equal width applying the tgtheta pinchlt technique.By way of example the machine chosen is basically a 3 phase 35 HP 10 pole squirrel cage induction motor. Clearly other frame sizes and pole numbers could be used. Stator and rotor details for the 10 pole machine are given in Table I.

The power stator winding STDP is a conventional 4 pole polyphase winding with a uniform 3 slots pole phase.The recovery stator winding STDR has 1 plus poles of high impedance, i.e. 28 turns per coil instead of 6 for the power winding. The total pole layout is 4 1 4 1 111plus indicates that the a.s,c. poles have a natural pole pitch reduced from the power pole pitch by about 1 s where s is the per unit slip.The stator a.s.c. windings indicated schematically at STSC are connected directly to the power windings without the use of a phase shifter. The appropriate phase relationship has been built in to the machine by the winding design.This relationship is not only the connection point along a phase winding but which of the propulsion phase windings is connected to which phase of the a.s.c. windings. This means that a particular winding design having a selected phase displacement theta pinch of the a.s.c. portion with respect to the propulsion portion is really only exactly appropriate for one frequency, one voltage, one load and one slip value, at which nil braking torque exists despite recovery of reactive power. Active techniques using cyclo converter style circuits have been mentioned above and can cope with a very wide range by varying operating conditions. Figure 11 shows at Figures lia and llb an example of a circuit embodying the invention with such techniques. Figure lla shows a connection arrangement of a linear induction machine embodying the invention to permit the correct phase shift between the propulsion and a.s.c.windings over a wide speed range. The machine has a primary PYB of a propulsion portion LIMB and a condenser portion ASCB. The machine secondary, SYB, is, in this embodiment an elongate reaction rail, Clearly other machine constructions could be used. The propulsion portionLIMB is energised directly from the supply, typically 3 50 Hz. The condenser portion ASCB is connected to the same supply through a semiconductor phase shifter SPS.Conveniently this is a 6 x 600 phase shifter provided by s.c.r. devices in nine gated groups each containing a pair of devices, or possibly a suitable bilateral device. Figure lib shows the gating required for different slip values, on a per unit basis. The blocks in Figure lib are permissible operating zones. A small, say t 2 , adjustment of the operating voltage covers the deadba,id spaces. The distinction of the phase shifter from the superficially similar cyclo converter is emphasised.Firstly there is only phase shifting at 600 steps not frequency conversio. Secondly the devices are always gated at a zero delay angle without phase chopping, the aim is a transient free connection of the a.s.c. and the supply at the desired phase. Thirdly the required gating is set by the phase difference between the propulsion and a.s.c. portions which is related to the reactive power capability of the condenser winding and the slip in the propulsion portion. However a less complex technique is also needed for wider commercial acceptability and simplicity. For example semiconductor s.c.r. or transistor devices could be included in selected windings to extend the passively selected operating conditions by providing some automatic variation of phase relationship during operation. An example of such a technique is shown in the machine winding layout of Figure 12. A short circuited coil is added to each a.soc. section. The coils, numbers 34 and 78 in this machine are connected in series aiding by way of a bilateral s.c.r. device T1, T2 and surge limiting resistor R. Clearly more shorting coils can be used if desired. In this winding layout, and in Figure 10, the left hand coil in a slot is beneath the right hand one and arrow A indicates the rotor rotation sense. The machines just described exemplify designs embodying the invention that are applicable to 10 pole squirrel cage motors. Other pole distributions, e.g. 8 2 for a 10 pole machine could be used but care must be taken to avoid magnetic imbalance leading to mechanical stress. Clearly some modification may be required for other motors. It should be noted that the a.s.c. winding will be appropriate only for a particular narrow range of slip, but this may be designed to be anywhere in the wider range 0.20 per unit motoring to 0.20 per unit braking. Also the peak performance may be obtained at other than exactly at the supply frequency but this discrepancy will be small and performance is not very dependent on small changes of frequency over this range. The machines described have solid or cage rotors but clearly a wound rotor can be used with advantage for the same reasons as wound rotors are used on conventional induction machines, in some circumstances. Figure 13 demonstrates an important characteristic of embodiments of some aspects of the invention, particularly those using the theta pinch technique. Figure 13 is a plot of the distribution envelope of total air gap flux for the machine of Figures 9 and 10. The winding portions ofFigure 9 can be identified in Figure 13 as the horizontal axis is calibrated in unit poles from coil 1 in Figure 9.Tr is the notional pitch of a recovery pole which is less than that of a propulsive pole Tp . Line BT nom is the total nominal level of flux in the air gap for a conventional induction motor wound on the frame used. BT max and BT min are the extremes of air gap flux resulting from the use of propulsive and recovery a.s.c. windings. The total value for BT is given by Bp2 Bq2 i.e. the vector sum of the in phase Bp and quadrature Bq flux. The plot is valid for a per unit slip s between zero and 0.20. The values of BT max and BT min can be controlled by adjusting the effective width and position in pole pitch units of the theta pitch winding portions STDR inFigures 9, 10 and 13. Figure 14 shows the relation between the ratio B B ma and the ratio of the pitch of the T min I max recovery pole Tr to that of a propulsive pole tp , i.e.Tr Tp. The ratio Tr Tp is expressed in terms of slip s .Three curves are shown for different typical Goodness Factors G in the range 10 to 100. The Goodness Factor is a wellknown parameter by which the overall performance of electrical machines can be compared. These relationships permit the ready application of the inventions at least in the Iwtheta pincht aspect, to induction motors in that by controlling the minimum value of the quadrature flux density Bq min the flux ratio B B and thence the pole pitch of the transient T min T max travelling wave resulting from the recovery pole winding portion STDR can be adjusted between Tp and 1 s Tp. In this way change in phase with slip variation can be accommodated.It is an important advantage and advance of the invention that this phase change can be achieved solely by winding design if required. The techniques described above show that by departing from the well established conventional form of machine in which the stator windings are regular and symmetrical and by introducing a form of the winding to produce operation under transient electromagnetic conditions the performance of the machine in terms of power factor or efficiency, or both, can be improved. Such modified machines can be very suitable for variable speed drive from an inverter in that harmonic filtering can be provided by the winding form, avoiding the existing requirement for an associated synchronous condenser machine. It is known that machines have been proposedwith irregular windings produced by changing the position of some c oifs to slots other than those indicated by a regular layout. However these proposals have been directed only at mitigating the end effects such as the back torquesll mentioned above when a rotor emerges from a stator field and attempts to make the end parts of the winding look like part of a continuing winding or provide a smoother transition to a lower flux value. The term machine used herein clearly includes generators and motors.
