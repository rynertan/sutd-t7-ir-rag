# Dual standard SECAM PAL color tv receiver with automatic control of operating mode.

## Abstract
Dual standard PAL SECAM color TV receiver includes circuitry for automatically controlling the receiver s operating mode in accordance with recognition of the SECAM or PAL format of the received signals. A first sample and hold circuit 25 monitors the output of an FM detector 15 responsive to the received signals during blanking backporch portions of alternate line intervals, while a second sample and hold circuit 27 monitors the output of said FM detector during blanking backporch portions of the intervening line intervals. Compar ison 29 of the outputs of the two sample and hold circuits achieves the desired format recognition. To avoid false recog nition, sampling interval beginning is delayed relative to begin ning of SECAM lead in oscillations or PAL swinging bursts, while sampling interval termination substantially coincides with end of blanking interval.
