## Description
This invention relates to liquid dye preparations and especially to concentrated aqueous solutions of anionic dyes. Water soluble anionic dyes are currently formulated, in the main, as powders. These can be dusty causing an environmental hazard and they are not suitable for automatic metering until dissolved in water, an operation which can be time consuming and difficult. There is therefore a need for liquid dye preparations, particularly aqueous solutions, which avoid these problems. Such solutions need to be concentrated in order to reduce the volume of the product to a minimum and reduce transportation and packaging costs but the aqueous solubility of anionic dyes is often insufficient to permit the preparation of concentrated solutions especially when the dye is contaminated by inorganic salts from the manufacturing process. Agents are known, however, which have the effect of increasing the aqueous solubility of anionic dyes. Such agents include urea and caprolactam which are commonly used for this purpose whilst other agents proposed include alkylphenol ethylene oxide condensates although these are generally much less effective. It has now been found that the aqueous solubility of anionic dyes may be significantly increased by the presence of polyalkyleneoxy compounds based on naphthalene, the effect being much greater than could have been predicted from the behaviour of the corresponding alkylphenol ethoxylates. EP A 0026974 describes aqueous dispersions of insoluble pigments disperse dyes, containing a β naphthol ethoxylate dispersing agent. EP A 0123654 describes aqueous dispersions of insoluble anionic dyes, containing as dispersant an ethylene oxide or propylene oxide block copolymer or ethoxylated fatty alcohol. The invention provides a liquid dye preparation comprising an aqueous solution containing at least 0.5 by weight of a water soluble anionic dye and at least 0.1 by weight of a surfactant of the formula wherein It is preferred that when a Non ionic substituent represented by R is alkyl it is C₁ ₄ alkyl. It is preferred that the divalent bridging group represented by X is O . Typical values for n are usually in the range 3 100 and Y is preferably an ethylene radical. Z is preferably H or SO₃H. Especially useful surfactants for use in the dye preparations have the formula wherein Particular mention may be made of the adduct of 2 naphthol with 10 molecular proportions of ethylene oxide and its sulphuric acid ester. The water soluble anionic dye may be, for example, an acid, direct or reactive dye and it may belong to any of the known chemical classes, for example the azo, anthraquinone, triphenodioxazine and phthalocyanine classes. Particularly important dyes are those which, in the absence of the surfactant, have low solubility in water. The dye may be in the free acid form but is preferably in the form of a salt, for example a sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium or alkanolamine salt. The concentration of dye in the liquid preparations will vary from dye to dye. In some cases, the production of a liquid preparation containing 1 by weight of dye is a useful improvement. In other cases, the liquid preparations will contain at least 10 by weight of dye. The surfactant may be present in the liquid preparations in an amount of from 0.1 to 50 by weight but concentrations of from 1 to 30 and especially from 5 to 20 by weight are common. The preparations can also contain other normal ingredients of such compositions, for example anti foaming agents, buffers, humectants, thickeners, diluents and preservatives. The preparations of the invention, which may be made by mixing the dye and surfactant with water in appropriate proportions, may be used in conventional coloration processes, for example textile printing and dyeing processes.
