## Description
This invention relates to the field of preserving or stabilizing acid producing bacteria. More particularly, the invention relates to a method of preserving bacteria that not only obviates freezing but also facilitates storage for long periods of time at temperatures higher than freezing. Acid producing bacteria are used extensively in the manufacture of fermented meat products and silage, as well as in the manufacture of yogurt, cheese, and the like. Lactic acid producing bacteria are particularly useful in these manufacturing processes. Typical methods for storing these bacteria involve freezing, freeze drying, and or microencapsulation. Freezing has been widely used for storage of microorganisms, and extensive research has been conducted to determine the optimum conditions for maintenance of maximum activity in frozen cultures. See, for instance, Frozen Starters from Internal pH Control Grown Cultures , Technical Paper No. 6427, Oregon Agricultural Experiment Station, Journal of Dairy Science, Vol. 67, No. 1, 1984 , Thunnel and Sandine. Additionally, for over 20 years, freeze drying lyophilization has been employed in order to preserve lactic acid producing bacteria. See, for instance, Morichi, T., Preservation of Lactic Acid Bacteria by Freeze drying , JARQ, No. 3, Pages 170 176 1974 . Also, Suzuki in U.S. Patent No. 4,217,419 1980 , discloses lyophilization of a suspension of However, there are many problems accompanying these processes. As the freezing takes place, it kills some of the cells. Likewise, when it is decided to rehydrate the stored material, the rehydration process kills additional cells. Thus, carriers are employed to protect the culture during the freezing and or freeze drying process. Typical carriers are fermentable carbohydrates, such as glucose, lactose or sucrose. The presence of the fermentable carbohydrates, however, will cause the microorganism to produce acid, resulting in injury and or death to some of the bacterial cells due to the reduction in pH to a level below that which is optimal. Encapsulating techniques and encapsulated products for the controlled release of product as a function of the destruction of the encapsulating material over a period of time are also well established in the prior art as methods to preserve microorganisms. By protecting microorganisms from the outside environment, the capsule enables the microorganisms to continue to function. For instance, Lim and Moss, Microencapsulation of Living Cells and Tissues , Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Vol. 70, No. 4, Pages 351 354 April, 1981 , disclose a microencapsulation procedure for viable cells using calcium chloride to gel cells suspended in sodium alginate droplets. More recent studies relate to enhancing preservation of microorganisms without using the well established freezing, freeze drying, or microencapsulation techniques. For instance, use of a salt to preserve microorganisms without freezing is shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,308,287 Kahn and Eapen . This patent discloses a method to enhance preservation of yogurt which contains acid producing bacteria by using quinine salts. Another item of literature disclosing the use of a salt for preservation is Smith, Benedict, and Palumbo, Protection Against Heat Injury in Storage at 4 C of suspensions of Therefore, the present invention provides for a method to preserve acid producing bacteria comprising admixing the bacteria in a stabilizing amount of an aqueous buffered solution free of a carrier that is a specific substrate for the bacteria. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method for the stabilization or preservation of acid producing bacteria. The preservation may be at temperatures below freezing. However, the object of the present invention is that the method contemplates storage of the bacteria at temperatures above freezing. Because of the extremely advantageous aspect of avoiding the standard freezing techniques used in the prior art, the present method saves both time and money. Obviously, there is no thawing time if the bacteria are preserved at temperatures higher than freezing. Also, great cost savings come about because there is no need for expensive liquid nitrogen, which is the typical freezing agent used in the prior art. Furthermore, there is no stress from the freezing thawing cycle, which causes the death of some of the bacteria cells as they are frozen and the death of additional cells as the thawing takes place. Additionally, since the cultures are already in suspension, there is obviated the necessity of dissolving a thawed culture in order to use it. Lastly, all of the problems accompanying frozen storage are eliminated since although the cultures preserved by the technique of the present invention may be frozen, they do not need to be. Rather, they may be stored at temperatures above freezing, preferably at a approximately 4 C, or at even higher temperatures, such as at room temperature and above. At temperatures above freezing, the bacteria will substantially retain viability, with the total possible number of days of storage generally decreasing as the temperature increases. By substantially retain viability , it is intended to mean that during the storage time above 0 C any change of cell count will be within a factor of 10, which is within experimental error. At temperatures up to 37 C, viability is substantially retained for at least 6 days. In a desired embodiment, the bacteria will substantially retain viability when stored at approximately 4 C for 10 days, 20 days, or even longer time periods of 2 months or more. In the instant invention the microorganisms being stabilized in a buffered solution are bacteria that produce acid. Bacterial cells are cultured in a suitable growth media, and then harvested by standard techniques such as ultrafiltration and or centrifugation. Before placing the culture of bacterial cells in the buffered solution, the culture concentration should be adjusted to whatever cell count is desired. A buffered solution or suspension is prepared from water and one or more buffering agents. Cells of acid producing bacteria are admixed in this buffered medium. Alternatively, the bacteria may be admixed in H₂O, followed by the addition of a buffering agent. More particularly, a carrier may be employed to add texture to the buffered solution or suspension containing the bacteria. The carrier helps keep the bacteria dispersed and thus there is less of a tendency for them to settle to the bottom of the container holding the solution. If a carrier is employed, it must not be a specific substrate to the particular acid producing bacteria being stabilized. By the statement that a carrier employed in the instant invention is not a substrate , it is intended to mean the carrier is essentially not fermentable by the acid producing bacteria, and therefore there is substantially no production of acid. Certain starches or fermentable sugars, used as carriers in the prior art, are specific substrates to acid producing bacteria. Although acid producing bacteria will thrive in the presence of these starches or fermentable sugars, fermentation of the substrate by the bacteria occurs as a result of which acid is produced thereby reducing the pH and causing injury to the bacterial cells. It is especially desirable that the bacteria are preserved in a aqueous buffered solution including a carrier in the amount of 0.1 10 weight volume, preferably 0.2 2 . The carrier is not a specific substrate for the bacteria being preserved or stabilized. Aqueous buffered solutions alone may be employed, but it is desired to include a carrier in the buffered solution to provide texture and keep the bacterial cells in suspension even though stability of the bacteria admixed in only a buffered solution may be somewhat better. As used herein, the term suspension is intended to include true suspensions and or a physical state which would be regarded as a dispersion by some. Also, it is intended by suspension or dispersion to include those situations in which the bacteria may have settled down to the bottom of the container. The carrier, buffering agent, H₂O, and bacteria may be added together in any order. It is desirable that when a carrier is used it is selected from an edible material such as seaweed derivatives, like carageen and sodium alginate. Additional desirable carriers are pectin, Guar gum, Locust bean gum, xanthan gum, a polyol, a nonfermentable sugar, or an edible cellulose. These carriers are all GRAS, generally regarded as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Preferred carriers are sodium alginates, cellulose derivatives, or polyethylene glycol PEG . The pH is maintained near neutral in the present invention with any of several buffering agents. The desired pH range is from approximately 6.0 to approximately 8.0. More preferably, the pH is from 6.4 to 7.6. Any buffering agent that maintains the pH around neutral may be used, as long as it does not result in the production of a substantial amount of acid, i.e., is not a specific substrate for the bacteria. The preferred buffering agents are the phosphate buffers, such as diammonium phosphate, sodium phosphate dibasic, or mixtures thereof. Magnesium phosphate, magnesium ammonium phosphate and diammonium bicarbonate are also advantageously employed as buffering agents. The aqueous buffered solution will typically contain 0.2 5 weight volume of buffering agent. There can also optionally be included agents such as anti oxidants, mold inhibitors, and or salts. Usually, such agents have little or no effect on the storage viability of the microorganisms. These agents may be added in the amount of 0.1 5 weight volume, preferably 0.2 2 w v of additional agent to buffered solution. Typically, a small amount of sodium benzoate is added in order to prevent mold or fungus. Also, a small amount of the organic salt, sodium citrate, may be added to help maintain osmotic pressure within the cell. If storage life is reduced by a few days, this is usually offset by the advantage of the agent, i.e., inhibition of mold. The microorganisms preserved by the process of the present invention are the acid producing bacteria. In general, such bacteria possess the ability to ferment simple carbohydrates, such as lactose or glucose, with lactic acid being at least one, and usually the most abundant, of the fermentation products. Among such acid producing bacteria are The following examples of the instant invention are set forth here with the intention that they be only illustrative. It is not intended that the claims be limited thereto. The strain of Viable cells of A buffer wad prepared by mixing 2.8 g of NH₄ ₂HPO₄ in 100 cc of water. To this was added 0.7 g of sodium alginate, resulting in a prepared solution having a pH of 7.0. Next, 15 ml of a concentrated, freshly harvested culture of From the data in Table I, it can be seen that viability was substantially retained during storage at 4 C. No loss of viability was observed after 54 days as the cell count was essentially constant, i.e., within a factor of 10. There was not even any percent loss. After 6 days at a temperature of 22 C some percent loss of viability was observed, but there was no factor of 10 loss as the cell count was still at the same 10¹⁰. A loss in viability by a factor of 10, i.e., reduction of the cell count from 10¹⁰ to 10⁹, did not occur till 15 days. 25 ml of concentrated, freshly harvested, washed From Table II, it can be seen that good stability can be achieved using a buffer that does not include a carrier such as PEG or sodium alginate. Viability was substantially retained as there was neither a percent loss nor a factor of 10 loss at a storage temperature of 4 C for as many as 47 days and at a storage temperature of 22 C for as many as 26 days. At 32 C, a factor of 10 loss did not occur till 18 days and at 37 C not till 11 days. A buffer was prepared by mixing 5 g NH₄ ₂ HPO₄ in 100 ml of water. To this was added 1g PEG 3000, 1 g sodium benzoate and 0.17 g sodium citrate. Then, 25 ml of concentrated, freshly harvested, unwashed From the data in Table III, it can be seen that at 32 C viability was substantially retained past 10 days, with no factor of 10 loss till 19 days. At a higher temperature of 37 C, a factor of 10 loss in cell count started at 6 days. The procedure of Example I was repeated, except that to prevent mold sodium benzoate was added in the amount of 1 weight volume to the solution of sodium alginate and diammonium phosphate. Then, this prepared solution was used for suspending the In summary, Example I illustrates the embodiment of using a buffer solution containing sodium alginate as the carrier. Table II illustrates using a buffer solution without any carrier. However, without the carrier to add texture, the bacteria tended to fall out of suspension, and thus administering this product, for instance as an oral administration to farm animals, would be difficult. Table III illustrates using a buffered solution containing PEG as the carrier together with the optional stability enhancing agents, sodium benzoate and sodium citrate. As can be seen in Examples I and II above, no loss in viability occurs when the
