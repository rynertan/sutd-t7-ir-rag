# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO ELECTRIC ARC FURNACES

## Abstract
This invention concerns apparatus for selectively connect ing an electrode of an electric arc furnace to a source of cooling fluid. The apparatus includes a coupling having passageways extending therethrough for the flow of cooling fluid and com prises at least two separable sections, one such section being connected to receive cooling fluid from the source and the oth er to convey such cooling fluid to the electrode when coupled to the said one section. Guide means are provided to guide one separable section into close proximity to the other section and to clamp the assembled sections together to connect the elec trode to the source of cooling fluid.
