## Abstract
Polyurethane plastics, including foams, made from polyisocyanates and polymer polyols exhibit enhanced load bearing properties and reduced polymer loadings when the polymer polyol is a simple polymer polyol prepared by polymerizing at least one vinyl monomer in the presence of an epoxy resin modified polyol via a free radical reaction. An especially suitable epoxy resin modified polyol is one in which an initiator is reacted with an alkylene oxide and epoxy resin in such a way that the epoxy resin is added internally along the length of an alkylene oxide chain.
