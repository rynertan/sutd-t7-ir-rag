## Abstract
DNA capabable of transforming a cell to allow regulated in vivo formation of a protein producing DNA segment comprising at least two subsegments positioned so that a specified end of one subsegment is adjacent a specified end of the other subsegment the clonable DNA comprises a first DNA sequence comprising one subsegment, the specified end of which is adjacent a DNA site for the enzymatic site specific recombination a second DNA sequence comprising the other subsegment, the specified end of which is adjacent a second DNA site for enzymatic site specific recombination, said second enzyme specific site being remote from said first enzyme specific site, whereby in vivo exposure of a population of the transforming DNA to a selected enzyme system triggers synchronized DNA rearrangement to form the protein producing DNA segment, and to favour such formation over enzymatic reversal of the DNA rearrangement to reform the subsegments. Methods of using the DNA and precursors to the DNA are also disclosed. Cells used in the transformation are also disclosed.
