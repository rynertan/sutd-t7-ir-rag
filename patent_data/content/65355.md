# Fastener tool.

## Abstract
A fastener tool 20 has a housing 22 in which is mount ed a universal motor 24 to be continuously operated during operation of the tool. A gear 72 driven by the motor 24 is a rotary driven member. A drive pin 80 is carried by the gear 72 to rotate therewith and is free to be shifted axially relative the gear 72 . A drive bar 76 is mounted in the housing 22 to drive fasteners 46 . The drive pin 80 is connectable to the drive bar 76 to produce a power stroke and a return stroke. An interrupt mechanism 78 is operative to prevent succes sive power strokes and includes the drive pin 80 it acts to disconnect the drive pin 80 from the drive bar 76 . Also the interrupt mechanism 78 controls the connection of the drive pin 80 and drive bar 76 . The maximum number of power strokes are one half the number of rotary cycles of the rotary driven member. The interrupt mechanism 78 includes a linkage 90 for sensing workpiece engagement and operator actuation of the tool, each of which are required to produce a single power stroke. The interrupt mechanism 78 may also include a track 84 and shifter 86 to axially shift the drive pin 80 . The drive bar 76 has a slot 120 which in a start position is aligned receive or release the pin 80 during a predeter mined 45 arc of gear rotation. A detent 128 yieldly holds the drive bar 76 in the start position.
