# Extraction process for the selective removal of cobalt II from aqueous solutions.

## Abstract
Cobalt II bearing aqueous solutions may be treated with an extractant comprising an organic soluble phosphinic acid, or a salt thereof, to separate the cobalt II from the aqueous solution. Typical extraction techniques compatible with the instant process include liquid liquid extraction employing either mixer settlers or columns, packed beds of supported extractants as in ion exchange, liquid membrane extraction and selective supported membrane extraction.
