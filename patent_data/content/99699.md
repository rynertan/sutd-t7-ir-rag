# Polymeric microfibrous filter sheet, preparation and use.

## Abstract
Microfibrous, polymeric sheets and filter elements pre pared therefrom comprising a normally hydrophobic, micro fibrous, polymeric web, wherein the surfaces of the microfib rous making up the web are coated with a cured, precipitated cationic, thermosetting binder resin or polymer, which elements are hydrophilic and have a positive zeta potential. The corresponding process comprises 1 applying a solution of a precipitating agent to a hydrophobic web 2 applying a binder resin to the web of step 1 3 working the web of step 2 to mix the agent and binder, thereby facilitating the precipitation of the binder resin and the distribution of the precipitated binder resin as a coating on the surface of the microfibers of the web and 4 curing the web of step 3 to form desired filter elements.
