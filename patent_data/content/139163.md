# Multiple data transfer system having a plurality of disk drives.

## Abstract
A data transfer apparatus is disclosed as typified by a floppy disk drive 10 which, together with one or more like devices, is daisy chained to a central processor 14 unit via a controller 16 . Each disk drive comprises a disk motor 20 for driving a record disk 18 under the control of a disk motor drive circuit 54 , a head motor 34 for incrementally moving a transducer head 32 radially of the record disk under the control of a head motor drive circuit 60 , and a read write circuit 8 for processing data read from, or to be written on, the record disk via the transducer head. Also included in each disk drive is a sensor control circuit 92 associated with an optical sensor assembly 86 for producing a DISK PRE SENCE signal representative of the presence or absence of the record disk in the disk drive. In order to avoid waste of power, at least one, preferably all, of the disk motor drive circuit 54 , head motor drive circuit 60 , and read write circuit 68 is connected to an external power line via a power control switch 98 which is closed in response to the DISK PRESENCE signal only when the record disk 18 is loaded in the disk drive 10 . Additional embodiments are disclosed wherein the power control switch 98 responds not only to the DISK PRESENCE signal but also to a standard MOTOR ON signal or DRIVE SELECT signals, or to both, which are supplied from the host equipment.
