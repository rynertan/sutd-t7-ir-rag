# DIGITAL TO ANALOG CONVERTER

## Abstract
A digital to analog converter comprises a digital to ana log converting section for converting digital input data into an analog output signal and an error correction circuit. The error correction circuit selectively generates one of different amount of analog signals in response to a specific state of a predeter mined bit of the binary input data, the amount of the generated analog signal being a 2
