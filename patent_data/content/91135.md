## Description
The invention relates to high activity Mg and Ti containing complex catalyst compositions. Until recently, low density 0.940 polyethylene has been produced commercially, for the most part, by the high pressure 1050 bar 15,000 psi homopolymerization of ethylene in the gas phase in stirred and elongated tubular reactors in the absence of solvents using free radical initiators. On a world wide basis, the amount of low density polyethylene produced in this fashion annually, amounts to more than about 6,000,000 t. As recently disclosed in US A 4,011,382 and in BE A 839,380 it has been found that low density polyethylene can be produced commercially at pressures of 69 bar 1000 psi in a gas phase reaction in the absence of solvents by employing selected chromium and titanium and, optionally, fluorine containing catalysts under specific operating conditions in a fluid bed process. The products produced by the processes of US A 4,011,382 and BE A 839,380, however, have a relatively broad molecular weight distribution Mw Mn of 6 to 20. As such, although readily useful for a large number of applications in the areas of wire and cable insulation and molded pipe they are not broadly useful in the areas of injection molding applications. They are also not broadly used in the area of film applications because of the poor optical and mechanical properties of films made from such resins. To be commercially useful in a gas phase process, such as fluid bed process of US A 3,709,853 4,003,712 and 4,011, 382 and CA A 991,798 and BE A 839,380, the catalyst employed must be a high activity catalyst, this is, it must have a level of productivity of 50,000, and preferably 100,000 kg of polymer per kg of primary metal in the catalyst. This is so because such gas phase processes usually do not employ any catalyst residue removing procedures. Thus, the catalyst residue in the polymer must be so small that it can be left in the polymer without causing any undue problems in the hands of the resin fabricator and or ultimate consumer. Where a high activity catalyst is successfully used in such fluid bed processes the heavy metal content of the resin is of the order of 20 parts per million ppm of primary metal at a productivity level of 50,000 and of the order of 10 ppm at a productivity level of 100,000 and of the order of 3 ppm at a productivity level of 300,000. Low catalyst residue contents are also important where the catalyst is made with chlorine containing materials such as the titanium, magnesium and or aluminum chlorides used in some so called Ziegler or Ziegler Natta catalysts. High residual chlorine values in a molding resin will cause pitting and corrosion on the metal surfaces of the molding devices. Cl residues of the order of 200 ppm are not commercially useful. US A 3,989,881 discloses the use of a high activity catalyst for the manufacture, under slurry polymerization conditions, of ethylene polymers having a relatively narrow molecular weight distribution Mw Mn of about 2.7 to 3.1. Attempts were made to use catalysts similar to those described in US A 3,989,881 for the purpose of making polyethylene of narrow molecular weight distribution by polymerizing ethylene alone or with propylene in the gas phase in a fluid bed process using apparatus and conditions similar to those employed in US A 4,011,382 and BE A 839,380. These attempts were not successful. In order to avoid the use of the solvents in the slurried catalyst systems of US A 3,989,881 the Ti Mg containing components were dried. However, the dried material, a viscous, gummy, pyrophoric composition, could not be readily fed to the reactor because it was not in a free flowing form. Even when blended with silica, to improve its free flowing properties and then added to the reactor, the results were commercially unacceptable. The productivity of the catalyst was poor, or the catalyst was pyrophoric and difficult to handle, or the polymer product had a low bulk density, i.e. of the order of 0.096 g cm³ 6 pounds cubic foot . Polymers of such low bulk density are not commercially desirable because they are fluffy. If the polymer is to be stored or sold in granular form, significantly larger amounts of storage and shipping space is required for handling these materials. Even if the granular polymer is to be pelletized prior to shipping, the processing of a given quantity of the low bulk density material through the pelletizing equipment requires significantly longer processing times than would the same quantity of high bulk density materials, when using the same extrusion equipment. US A 4,124,532 discloses the polymerization of ethylene and propylene with high activity catalysts. These catalysts comprise complexes which may contain magnesium and titanium. These complexes are prepared by reacting the halide MX₂ where M may be Mg with a compound M Y where M may be Ti and Y is halogen or an organic radical in an electron donor compound. These complexes are then isolated by either crystallization, by evaporation of the solvent or by precipitation. However, US A 4,124,532 does not disclose any special techniques or methods of preparing the catalyst in order to achieve the desirable results described in the present invention. The use of the catalysts described in US A 4,124,532, without these special methods, would not lead to a commercial fluid bed process to produce polyethylene at commercial rates. In addition the examples in the gas phase do not describe a practical process of copolymerization to produce the special low density copolymers with attractive polymer morphology described in the present invention. US A 3,922,322 and 4,035,560 disclose the use of several Ti and Mg containing catalysts for the manufacture of granular ethylene polymers in a gas phase fluid bed process under a pressure of 69 bar 1000 psi . The use of these catalysts in these processes, however, has significant disadvantages. The catalyst of US A 3,922,322 provides polymers having a very high catalyst residue content i.e., about 100 ppm of Ti and greater than about 300 ppm Cl, according to the working example of this patent. Further, as disclosed in the working example of US A 3,922,322, the catalyst is used in the form of a prepolymer, and very high volumes of the catalyst composition must be fed to the reactor. The preparation and use of this catalyst thus requires the use of relatively barge sized equipment for the manufacture, storage and transporting of the catalyst. The catalysts of US A 4,035,560 also apparently provide polymers having high catalyst residues, and the catalyst compositions are apparently pyrophoric because of the types and amounts of reducing agents employed in such catalysts. DE A 2543272 discloses a catalyst system for olefin polymerisation and copolymerisation, which comprises a catalyst component 1 containing Ti and or V and a catalyst component 2 comprising an organometallic compound of Al Mg, or Zn. Component 1 is prepared in a two step process by first contacting finely divided porous silica with a solution of a Mg compound dissolved in an organic solvent selected from hydrocarbons, alcohols, ethers and esters and then contacting the solid intermediate product formed with a solid, liquid or dissolved compound of Ti and or V. The thus obtained solid catalyst component 1 comprises porous silica on which the Mg compound and the Ti and or V compounds are superimposed in a layer structure. For polymerisation said catalyst components 1 and 2 are combined inside or outside the polymerisation reactor. EP A 4645 which has priority dates of 31 March 1978 and 27 February 1979 and a publication date of 17 October 1979 discloses that ethylene copolymers, having a density of 0.91 to 0.96, a melt flow ratio of 22 to 32 and a relatively low residual catalyst content can be produced in granular form, at relatively high productivities if the monomer s are polymerized in a gas phase process with a specific high activity Mg Ti containing complex catalyst which is blended with an inert carrier material. The granular polymers thus produced have excellent physical properties which allow them to be used in a broad range of molding application. However, these polymers have some disadvantages. First, because of the presence of the carrier material in the catalyst which is not removed from the polymer prior to the molding thereof, the polymer containing certain of these carrier materials is not too useful for clear film application. These carrier particles may impart poor film rating values to clear films made from such polymers. Second, the polymers, particularly at the lower polymer densities, also have a relatively low bulk density. The handling of these polymers therefore requires the use of larger volumes of shipping and storing equipment than is required for the pelleted products which the molding industry is more accustomed to handling. As a result larger capital investments are needed for the equipment needed to handle and store these low bulk density granular materials. Further, the feeding of the low bulk density granular materials to molding and extrusion equipment requires longer feed times than is required for the same weight of pelleted material because of the larger volumes of the granular material that are involved. Third, the polymer particles formed during the fluid bed polymerization process are irregular in shape and are somewhat difficult to fluidize. The final product also contains a relatively high level of fines, i.e., particles having a particle size of 150 µm. It has now been unexpectedly found that by the use of the new catalyst compositions of this invention ethylene copolymers having a wide density range of 0.91 to 0.94 and a melt flow ratio of 22 to 32 and which have a relatively high bulk density and which provide films of good clarity can be produced at relatively high productivities for commercial purposes by a gas phase process. The ethylene is copolymerized with one or more C₃ to C₈ alpha olefins in the presence of the new high activity magnesium titanium complex catalysts. The new catalyst composition comprises a precursor composition which can be activated with an organoaluminum activator compound, said precursor composition containing a magnesium compound, titanium compound and electron donor compound and being impregnated in an inert porous carrier, characterized by a precursor composition of the formula The catalyst composition of the invention is prepared by forming a precursor composition from a magnesium compound titanium compound and electron donor compound, and then activating the precursor composition with an organoaluminum activator compound to form the catalyst, characterized by In a further embodiment the dried solid impregnated precursor composition is further activated in a polymerization reactor by adding additional activator compound to the reactor in such amounts as to provide 10 to 400 mols of said activator compound per mol of titanium compound in said precursor composition. The invention also relates to a catalyst composition obtainable according to the latter embodiment. The compounds used to form the high activity catalyst of the present invention comprise at least one titanium compound, at least one magnesium compound, at least one electron donor compound, at least one activator compound and at least one porous inert carrier material, as defined below. The titanium compound has the structure The titanium compounds can be used individually or in combinations thereof, and would include TiCl₃, TiCl₄, Ti OCH₃ Cl₃, Ti OC₆H₅ Cl₃, Ti OCOCH₃ Cl₃ and Ti OCOC₆H₅ Cl₃. The magnesium compound has the structure 0.5 to 56, and preferably 1 to 10, mols of the magnesium compound are used per mol of the titanium compound in preparing the catalysts of the present invention. The titanium compound and the magnesium compound should be used in a form which will facilitate their dissolution in the electron donor compound, as described herein below. The electron donor compound is an organic compound which is liquid at 25 The electron donor compounds would include such compounds as alkyl esters of aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids, aliphatic ethers, cyclic ethers and aliphatic ketones. Among these electron donor compounds the preferable ones are alkyl esters of C₁ to C₄ saturated aliphatic carboxylic acids alkyl esters of C₇ to C₈ aromatic carboxylic acids C₂ to C₈, and preferably C₃ to C₄, aliphatic ethers C₃ to C₄ cyclic ethers, and preferably C₄ cyclic mono or di ether C₃ to C₆, and preferably C₃ to C₄, aliphatic ketones. The most preferred of these electron donor compounds would include methyl formate, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, ethyl ether, hexyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, acetone and methyl isobutyl ketone. The electron donor compounds can be used individually or in combination thereof. 2 to 85, and preferably 3 to 10 mols of the electron donor compound are used per mol of Ti. The activator compound has the structre Such activator compounds can be used individually or in combinations thereof and would include Al C₂H₅ ₃, Al C₂H₅ ₂Cl, Al i C₄H₉ ₃, Al₂ C₂H₅ ₃Cl₃, Al i C₄H₉ ₂H, Al C₆H₁₃ ₃, Al C₈H₁₇ ₃, Al C₂H₅ ₂H and Al C₂H₅ ₂ OC₂H₅ . 10 to 400, and preferably 10 to 100, mols of the activator compound are used per mol of the titanium compound in activating the catalysts of the present invention. The carrier materials are solid, particulate porous materials which are inert to the other components of the catalyst composition, and to the other active components of the reaction system. These carrier materials would include inorganic materials such as oxides of silicon and or aluminum. The carrier materials are used in the form of dry powders having an average particle size of about 10 to 250, and preferably of about 50 to 150 µm. These materials are also porous and have a surface area of 3, and preferably of 50, square meters per gram. Catalyst activity or productivity is apparently also improved with silica having pore sizes of 8 nm and preferably of 10 nm. The carrier material should be dry, that is, free of absorbed water. Drying of the carrier material is carried out by heating it at a temperature of 600 The new catalyst composition is prepared by first preparing a precursor composition from the titanium compound, the magnesium compound, and the electron donor compound, as described below, and then impregnating the carrier material with the precursor composition and then treating the impregnated precursor composition with the activator compound in one or more steps as described below. The precursor composition is formed by dissolving the titanium compound and the magnesium compound in the electron donor compound at a temperature of about 20 The crystallized or precipitated precursor composition may be isolated,in the form of fine, free flowing particles having an average particle size of about 10 to 100 µm and a bulk density of about 0.289 to 0.529 g ccm 18 to 35 pounds per cubic foot . When thus made as disclosed above the precursor composition has the formula The subscript for the element titanium Ti is the arabic numeral one. The residues in the above mentioned formulae have the following preferred definitions The precursor composition is then impregnated, in a weight ratio of 0.033 to 1, and preferably 0.1 to 0.33, parts of the precursor composition into one part by weight of the carrier material. The impregnation of the dried activated carrier with the precursor composition may be accomplished by dissolving the precursor composition in the electron donor compound, and by then admixing the carrier with the dissolved precursor composition so as to allow the precursor composition to impregnate the carrier. The solvent is then removed by drying at temperatures of 70 The carrier may also be impregnated with the precursor composition by adding the carrier to a solution of the chemical raw materials used to form the precursor composition in the electron donor compound, without isolating the precursor composition from such solution. The excess electron donor compound is then removed by drying or washing and drying at temperatures of 70 C. After the production of the precursor composition this composition must be treated with sufficient activator compound to transform the Ti atoms in the precursor composition to an active state. It has been found that, in order to prepare a useful catalyst it is necessary to conduct the activation in such a way that the final activation stage is conducted in such manner as to avoid the need for drying the fully active catalyst to remove solvent therefrom. The precursor composition is first partially activated out side the polymerization reactor by treating it with enough activator compound so as to provide a partially activated precursor composition which has an activator compound Ti molar ratio of 0 to 10 1 and preferably of about 4 to 8 1. This partial activation reaction is preferably carried out in a hydrocarbon solvent slurry followed by drying of the resulting mixture, to remove the solvent, at temperatures between 20 to 80, and preferably of 50 to 70 C. The resulting product is a free flowing solid particulate material which can be readily fed to the polymerization reactor. The partially activated and impregnated precursor composition thus obtained is fed to the polymerization reactor where the activation is completed by treatment with additional activator compound which can be the same or a different compound. The additional activator compound and the partially activated impregnated precursor composition are preferably fed to the reactor through separate feed lines. The additional activator compound may be sprayed into the reactor in the form of a solution thereof in a hydrocarbon solvent such as isopentane, hexane, or mineral oil. This solution usually contains about 2 to 30 weight percent of the activator compound. The additional activator compound is added to the reactor in such amounts as to provide, in the reactor, with the amounts of activator compound and titanium compound fed with the partially activated and impregnated precursor composition, a total Al Ti molar ratio of 10 to 400 and preferably of about 15 to 60. The additional amounts of activator compound added to the reactor, react with, and complete the activation of, the titanium compound in the reactor. In a continuous gas phase process,such as the fluid bed process disclosed below, discrete portions of the partially activated precursor composition impregnated on the carrier are continuously fed to the reactor, with discrete portions of any additional activator compound needed to complete the activation of the partially activated precursor composition, during the continuing polymerization process in order to replace active catalyst sites that are expended during the course of the reaction. The drawing shows a gas phase fluid bed reactor system in which the catalyst system of the present invention may be employed. The new catalyst compositions are useful in the production of ethylene copolymers of the above described properties. The obtained copolymers are granular and have a particle shape which is round and more conducive to being fluidized in a fluid bed process. Furthermore, the final polymer product contains a relatively low level of fines. The copolymers which may be prepared using the new catalyst compositions are copolymers of a major mol percent 90 of ethylene, and a minor mol percent 10 of one copolymer or more ter , tetra polymers C₃ to C₈ alpha olefins which should not contain any branching of any of their carbon atoms which is closer than the fourth carbon atom. These alpha olefins include propylene, butene 1, pentene 1, hexene 1, 4 methyl pentene 1, heptene 1 and octene 1. The preferred alpha olefins are propylene, butene 1, hexene 1, 4 methyl pentene 1 and octene 1. The copolymers have a density of about 0.91 to 0.94 and preferably 0.917 to 0.935. The density of the copolymer, at a given melt index level for the copolymer, is primarily regulated by the amount of the C₃ to C₈ comonomer which is copolymerized with the ethylene. In the absence of the comonomer, the ethylene would homopolymerize with the catalyst of the present invention to provide homopolymers having a density of about 0.96. Thus, the addition of progressively larger amounts of the comonomers to the copolymers results in a progressive lowering of the density of the copolymer. The amount of each of the various C₃ to C₈ comonomers needed to achieve the same result will vary from monomer to monomer, under the same reaction conditions. Thus, to achieve the same results, in the copolymers, in terms of a given density, at a given melt index level, larger molar amounts of the different comonomers would be needed in the order of C₃ C₄ C₅ C₆ C₇ C₈. The melt index of a copolymer is a reflection of its molecular weight. Polymers having a relatively high molecular weight, have a relatively low melt index. Ultrahigh molecular weight ethylene polymers have a high load HLMI melt index of about 0.0 and very high molecular weight ethylene polymers have a high load melt index HLMI of about 0.0 to about 1.0. Such high molecular weight polymers are difficult, if not impossible, to mold in conventional injection molding equipment. The polymers obtainable with the catalyst composition of the present invention, on the other hand, can be readily molded, in such equipment. They have a standard or normal load melt index of 0.0 to about 100, and preferably of about 0.5 to 80, and a high load melt index HLMI of about 11 to about 2000. The melt index of the polymers obtainable with the new catalyst composition is a function of a combination of the polymerization temperature of the reaction, the density of the copolymer and the hydrogen monomer ratio in the reaction system. Thus, the melt index is raised by increasing the polymerization temperature and or by decreasing the density of the polymer and or by increasing the hydrogen monomer ratio. In addition to hydrogen, other known chain transfer agents such as dialkyl zinc compounds may also be used to further increase the melt index of the copolymers. The copolymers obtainable with the new catalyst composition have an unsaturated group content of 1, and usually 0.1 to 0.3, C C 1000 carbon atoms. They have a n hexane extractables content at 50 C of less than about 3, and preferably of less than about 2, weight percent. The copolymers obtainable with the new catalyst composition have a residual catalyst content, in terms of parts per million of titanium metal, of the order or 0 to 20 parts per million, ppm at a productivity level of 50,000 and of the order of 0 to 10 ppm at a productivity level of 100,000 and of the order of 0 to 3 parts per million at a productivity level of 300,000. In terms of Cl, Br or I residues, the copolymers have a Cl, Br or I residue content which depends upon the Cl, Br or I content of the precursor. From the Ti to Cl, Br or I ratio in the initial precursor, it is possible to calculate Cl, Br, or I residues from knowledge of the productivity level based on titanium residue only. For many of the copolymers made with Cl containing components of the catalyst system Cl Ti 7 , one can calculate a Cl residue content of 0 to 140 ppm at a productivity of 50,000, a Cl content of 0 to 70 ppm at a productivity of 100,000, and a Cl content of 0 to 20 ppm at a productivity of 300,000. The copolymers are readily produced with the new catalyst compositions at productivities of up to about 500,000. The copolymers obtainable with the new catalyst composition are granular materials which have an average particle size of the order of about 0.125 to 1.78 mm, and preferably of about 0.5 to 1.0 mm, in diameter. The particle size is important for the purposes of readily fluidizing the polymer particles in the fluid bed reactor, as described below. The copolymers have a bulk density of about 0.304 to 0.50 g ccm 19 to 31 pounds per cubic foot . In addition to being useful for making film therefrom the copolymers are useful in other molding applications. For film making purposes the preferred copolymers are those having a density of about 0.912 to 0.940, and preferably of about 0.916 to 0.928 a molecular weight distribution Mw Mn of 2.7 to 3.6, and preferably of about 2.8 to 3.1 and a standard melt index of 0.5 to 5.0 and preferably of about 0.7 to 4.0. The films have a thickness of 0 to 0.25 mm 10 mils and preferably of 0 to 0.125 mm 5 mils and more preferably of 0 to 0.025 mm 1 mil . For the injection molding of flexible articles such as houseware materials, the preferred copolymers are those having a density of 0.920 to 0.940 and preferably of about 0.925 to 0.930 a molecular weight distribution Mw Mn of 2.7 to 3.6, and preferably of about 2.8 to 3.1 and a standard melt index of 2 to 100 and preferably of about 8 to 80. The polymerization reaction is conducted by contacting a stream of the monomers, in a gas phase process, such as in the fluid bed process described below, and substantially in the absence of catalyst poisons such as moisture, oxygen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and acetylene with a catalytically effective amount of the completely activated precursor composition the catalyst impregnated on a support at a temperature and at a pressure sufficient to initiate the polymerization reaction. In order to achieve the desired density ranges in the copolymers it is necessary to copolymerize enough of the C₃ comonomers with ethylene to achieve a level of 1 to 10 mol percent of the C₃ to C₈ comonomer in the copolymer. The amount of comonomer needed to achieve this result will depend on the particular comonomer s employed. There is provided below a listing of the amounts, in mols, of various comonomers that must be copolymerized with ethylene in order to provide polymers having the desired density range at any given melt index. The listing also indicates the relative molar concentration of such comonomer to ethylene, which must be present in the gas stream of monomers which is fed to the reactor. A fluidized bed reaction system which can be used in the practice of the process of the present invention is illustrated in Figure 1. With reference thereto the reactor 10 consists of a reaction zone 12 and a velocity reduction zone 14. The reaction zone 12 comprises a bed of growing polymer particles, formed polymer particles and a minor amount of catalyst particles fluidized by the continuous flow of polymerizable and modifying gaseous components in the form of make up feed and recycle gas through the reaction zone. To maintain a viable fluidized bed, the mass gas flow rate through the bed must be above the minimum flow required for fluidization, and preferably from about 1.5 to about 10 times G It is essential that the bed always contains particles to prevent the formation of localized hot spots and to entrap and distribute the particulate catalyst throughout the reaction zone. On start up, the reaction zone is usually charged with a base of particulate polymer particles before gas flow is initiated. Such particles may be identical in nature to the polymer to be formed or different therefrom. When different, they are withdrawn with the desired formed polymer particles as the first product. Eventually, a fluidized bed of the desired polymer particles supplants the start up bed. The partially activated precursor compound used in the fluidized bed is preferably stored for service in a reservoir 32 under a blanket of a gas which is inert to the stored material, such as nitrogen or argon. Fluidization is achieved by a high rate of gas recycle to and through the bed, typically in the order of about 50 times the rate of feed of make up gas. The fluidized bed has the general appearance of a dense mass of viable particles in possible free vortex flow as created by the percolation of gas through the bed. The pressure drop through the bed is equal to or slightly greater than the mass of the bed divided by the cross sectional area. It is thus dependent on the geometry of the reactor. Make up gas is fed to the bed at a rate equal to the rate at which particulate polymer product is withdrawn. The composition of the make up gas is determined by a gas analyzer 16 positioned above the bed. The gas analyzer determines the composition of the gas being recycled and the composition of the make up gas is adjusted accordingly to maintain an essentially steady gaseous composition within the reaction zone. To insure complete fluidization, the recycle gas and, where desired, part of the make up gas are returned to the reactor at point 18 below the bed. There exists a gas distribution plate 20 above the point of return to aid fluidizing the bed. The portion of the gas stream which does not react in the bed constitutes the recycle gas which is removed from the polymerization zone, preferably by passing it into a velocity reduction zone 14 above the bed where entrained particles are given an opportunity to drop back into the bed. Particle return may be aided by a cyclone 22 which may be part of the velocity reduction zone or exterior thereto. Where desired, the recycle gas may then be passed through a filter 24 designed to remove small particles at high gas flow rates to prevent dust from contacting heat transfer surfaces and compressor blades. The recycle gas is then compressed in a compressor 25 and then passed through a heat exchanger 26 wherein it is stripped of heat of reaction before it is returned to the bed. By constantly removing heat of reaction, no noticeable temperature gradient appears to exist within the upper portion of the bed. A temperature gradient will exist in the bottom of the bed in a layer of about 15 to 30 cm, between the temperature of the inlet gas and the temperature of the remainder of the bed. Thus, it has been observed that the bed acts to almost immediately adjust the temperature of the recycle gas above this bottom layer of the bed zone to make it conform to the temperature of the remainder of the bed thereby maintaining itself at an essentially constant temperature under steady conditions. The recycle is then returned to the reactor at its base 18 and to the fluidized bed through distribution plate 20. The compressor 25 can also be placed upstream of the heat exchanger 26. The distribution plate 20 plays an important role in the operation of the reactor. The fluidized bed contains growing and formed particulate polymer particles as well as catalyst particles. As the polymer particles are hot and possibly active, they must be prevented from settling, for if a quiescent mass is allowed to exist, any active catalyst contained therein may continue to react and cause fusion. Diffusing recycle gas through the bed at a rate sufficient to maintain fluidization at the base of the bed is, therefore, important. The distribution plate 20 serves this purpose and may be a screen, slotted plate, perforated plate, a plate of the bubble cap type and the like. The elements of the plate may all be stationary, or the plate may be of the mobile type disclosed in U S A 3,298,792. Whatever its design, it must diffuse the recycle gas through the particles at the base of the bed to keep them in a fluidized condition, and also serve to support a quiescent bed of resin particles when the reactor is not in operation. The mobile elements of the plate may be used to dislodge any polymer particles entrapped in or on the plate. Hydrogen may be used as a chain transfer agent in the polymerization reaction of the present invention. The ratio of hydrogen ethylene employed will vary between about 0 to about 2.0 moles of hydrogen per mole of the monomer in the gas stream. Any gas inert to the catalyst and reactants can also be present in the gas strem. The activator compound is preferably added to the gas recycle system at the hottest portion thereof. Addition into the recycle line, therefore, downstream from the heat exchanger is preferred, as from dispenser 27 through line 27A. Compounds of the structure Zn R It is essential to operate the fluid bed reactor at a temperature below the sintering temperature of the polymer particles. To insure that sintering will not occur, operating temperatures below the sintering temperature are desired. For the production of ethylene copolymers in the process of the present invention an operating temperature of 30 to 105 C is preferred and a temperature of about 75 to 95 C is most preferred. Temperatures of about 75 to 90 C are used to prepare products having a density of 0.91 to 0.92, and temperatures of about 80 to 100 C are used to prepare products having a density of 0.92 to 0.94. The fluid bed reactor is operated at pressures of up to 69 bar 1000 psi and is preferably operated at a pressure of from 10.3 to 24 bar 150 to 350 psi , with operation at higher pressures in such ranges favoring heat transfer since an increase in pressure increases the unit volume heat capacity of the gas. The partially activated precursor composition is injected into the bed at a rate equal to its consumption at a point 30 which is above the distribution plate 20. Injection into the viable bed aids in distributing the catalyst throughout the bed and tends to preclude the formation of localized spots of high catalyst concentration which may result in the formation of hot spots . A gas which is inert to the catalyst such as nitrogen or argon is used to carry the partially activated precursor composition, and any additional activator compound or non gaseous chain transfer agent that is needed, into the bed. The production rate of the bed is controlled by the rate of catalyst injection. The productivity of the bed may be increased by simply increasing the rate of catalyst injection and decreased by reducing the rate of catalyst injection. Since any change in the rate of catalyst injection will change the rate of generation of the heat of reaction, the temperature of the recycle gas is adjusted upwards or downwards to accomodate the change in rate of heat generation. This insures the maintenance of an essentially constant temperature in the bed. Complete instrumentation of both the fluidized bed and the recycle gas cooling system, is, of course, necessary to detect any temperature change in the bed so as to enable the operator to make a suitable adjustment in the temperature of the recycle gas. Under a given set of operating conditions, the fluidized bed is maintained at essentially a constant height by withdrawing a portion of the bed as product at a rate equal to the rate of formation of the particulate polymer product. Since the rate of heat generation is directly related to product formation, a measurement of the temperature rise of the gas across the reactor the difference between inlet gas temperature and exit gas temperature is determinative of the rate of particulate polymer formation at a constant gas velocity. The particulate polymer product is preferably continuously withdrawn at a point 34 at or close to the distribution plate 20 and in suspension with a portion of the gas stream which is vented before the particles settle to preclude further polymerization and sintering when the particles reach their ultimate collection zone. The suspending gas may also be used, as mentioned above, to drive the product of one reactor to another reactor. The particulate polymer product is conveniently and preferably withdrawn through the sequential operation of a pair of timed valves 36 and 38 defining a segregation zone 40. While valve 38 is closed, valve 36 is opened to emit a plug of gas and product to the zone 40 between it and valve 36 which is then closed. Valve 38 is then opened to deliver the product to an external recovery zone. Valve 38 is then closed to await the next product recovery operation. Finally, the fluidized bed reactor is equipped with an adequate venting system to allow venting the bed during start up and shut down. The reactor does not require the use of stirring means and or wall scraping means. The highly active supported catalyst system of this invention appears to yield a fluid bed product having an average particle size between 0.25 to 1.78 mm 0.01 to 0.07 inches and preferably 0.5 to 1 mm 0.02 to 0.04 inches wherein catalyst residue is unusually low. The polymer particles are relatively easy to fluidize in a fluid bed process. The polymer product contains a relatively low level of fines 150 µm i.e. 4 by weight. The feed stream of gaseous monomer, with or without inert gaseous diluents, is fed into the reactor at a space time yield of 32 to 160 kg h m³ 2 to 10 pounds hour cubic foot of bed volume. The polymer directly recovered from the polymerization reactor is in granular form virgin polymer . The following Examples are designed to illustrate the present invention and are not intended as a limitation upon the scope thereof. The properties of the polymers produced with the new catalyst composition were determined by the following test methods Ethylene was copolymerized with butene 1 in each of this series of 6 experiments. In experiment 1 to 3 the catalyst used was formed as described above. The silica impregnated catalyst system of experiments 1 and 2 contained 14.5 weight of precursor composition , and the silica impregnated catalyst system of experiment 3 contained 20.0 weight of precursor composition. The silica carrier used for the catalyst of experiment 2 was treated with triethyl aluminum, before it was used to make the supported catalyst system. The catalysts used in experiments 4 to 6 were prepared by methods outside the scope of the catalysts of the present invention for comparative purposes. The catalyst of experiment 4 was prepared by physically blending 7.5 weight of the unimpregnated precursor composition of preparation Ia with 92.5 weight of polyethylene powder. The polyethylene powder is high pressure, low density, 0.94 ethylene homopolymer which has an average particle size of about 50 to 150 µm. The catalyst of experiments 5 and 6 was prepared by physically blending 20 weight of the unimpregnated precursor composition of preparation Ia with 80 weight of silica having a surface area of 300 m² gram and an average particle size of 70 µm. In each of experiments 1 to 6 the precursor composition was partially activated with triethyl aluminum so as to provide the silica precursor composition with an Al Ti mol ratio of 5 1. The completion of the activation of the precursor composition in the polymerization reactor was accomplished with a 5 by weight solution of triethyl aluminum in isopentane so as to provide the completely activated catalyst in the reactor with an Al Ti mol ratio of 25 to 30. Each of the reactions was conducted for 1 hour, after equilibrium was reached, at 85 C and under a pressure of 20.5 bar 300 psig , a gas velocity of about 3 to 6 times Gmf and a space time yield of about 4.4 to 6.3 in a fluid bed reactor system. The reaction system was as described in the drawing above. It has a lower section 3 m high and 34.3 cm in inner diameter, and an upper section which was 4.8 m high and 59.7 cm in inner diameter. Table I below lists the butene 1 ethylene molar ratio and H₂ ethylene molar ratio and the space time yield kg h m³ of bed space used in each experiment, as well as the various properties of the polymers made in such experiments and various properties of film samples made from some of such polymers. As compared to granular copolymers made in EP A 4645 the copolymers prepared using the new catalyst compositions of the present invention, in virgin powder form, and at a given density and melt index, have a smaller average particle size, a narrower particle size distribution, are easier to fluidize and have higher bulk densities. In film form, these copolymers have significantly better film properties than the copolymers made in said copending application. Ethylene was copolymerized with butene 1 in each of these series of experiments. In these experiments the silica impregnated catalyst precursor was formed as described above. The silica impregnated catalyst system contained 20.0 weight of precursor composition. The silica carrier used for the catalysts of these examples was treated with tri ethyl aluminum, before it was used to make the supported catalyst system. In each of these examples the precursor composition was partially activated with the aluminum compound shown in Table II, according to the procedure as described above, so as to provide the impregnated precursor with an Al Ti mol ratio as shown in Table II. The completion of the activation of the precursor composition in the polymerization reactor was accomplished with a 5 by weight solution of tri ethyl aluminum in isopentane so as to provide the completely activated catalyst in the reactor with an Al Ti mol ratio of 25 to 30. Each of the polymerization reactions was conducted as described in experiments 1 to 6. Table II below lists the activator compound and Al Ti mole ratio in preparing the precursor composition. The butene 1 ethylene molar ratio and H₂ ethylene molar ratio and the space time yield kg h m³ of bed space used in each experiment as well as the various properties of the polymers made in such experiments. The experiments of Table II demonstrate that copolymers having high bulk density, low catalyst residues, and attractive polymer properties can be prepared with the catalysts of the present invention which catalysts are prepared with two different activator compounds.
