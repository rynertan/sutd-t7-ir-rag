## Description
The present invention concerns a dish washer adapted for use in a sink.Dish washers are known which are in use in a great many homes. They, however, present an expensive capital investment and require a large space for their installment.It is the object of the present invention to provide a dish washer for use in a sink, so that the dishes can be washed automatically when required, and when no dishes are to be washed, the dish washer can be removed. It is a further object of the invention to provide a dish washer for use in a sink, which is inexpensive and requires little space for storage.The invention consists in a dish washer adapted for use in a sink having means for stacking the dishes, means for covering the stacked dishes, at least one rotary sprinkler which is operated by the water main pressure and is adapted to spray the stacked dishes and connecting means for connecting the water supply for said sink to said sprinkler.The invention is illustrated by way of example only in the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a plan view of a sink provided with a dish washer as used in a sink. Fig. 2 is a transverse cross section thereof. Fig. 3 is a longitudinal section thereof. Fig. 4 shows schematically a rear elevational view, partly in section, of the water supply arrangement for the dish washer, according to the invention. A sink 1 is provided with the conventional hot and cold water supply 2 leading to a central faucet 3 and a drain 4, all as known. According to the invention the dish washer comprises a mesh basket 5 which is disposed in sink 1, and a cover 6 being preferably of transparent plastics is set onto the rim of the sink. Partitions and posts are provided on the bottom of basket 5 in an arrangement similar to that known in racks for conventional dish washers, so that plates, cups and glasses can be stacked therein, the open part of the cup or glass facing downward. Two rotary reaction sprinklers 8 are arranged below basket 5, their nozzles facing upwardly. A pipe 9 leads to each sprinkler 8 from a connector 10 mounted in the sink wall and being connected to a pipe line 11. Pipe line 11 is connected on the one hand to the mains and on the other to a tap 12 mounted on the sink top near faucet 3.It can be seen that when pipe 9 is attached to connector 10 and tap 12 is opened when the stacked and covered basket 5 has been set into the sink 1, the reaction of the sprinklers 8 will rotate them to spray the dishes within basket 5. A container 13 for detergent is mounted in the sink near the faucet 3 and extends downward having an outlet 15 connected to pipe 11. Thus when tap 12 is open and water flows through pipe 11, the detergent will be fed to the water and will be sprayed onto the stacked dishes until container 13 will be empty, whereafter clear water will rinse the washed dishes. When no dishes are to be washed, the covered basket can be removed and be stored.Many variations of the above arrangement are possible within the scope of the present invention. If desired, the cover 6 may be hinged to the sink or to the basket 5. The cover 6 may include the water feed pipe 9, which instead of being connected to the mains is attached by way of a quick connector to faucet 3. The container 13 for the detergent may be mounted in the pipe line 9 or in any other convenient position in the water supply to the sprinkler. While two sprinklers have been shown, one or more than two may be provided. Instead of the sprinklers being mounted on the basket 5, they may be mounted in the sink itself, preferably in a depression thereof, so that when the basket is removed from the sink, the sink can be utilized as a conventional kitchen sink. If desired, a circulating pump may be arranged between pipe 9 and drain 4. The connection of the pipe 9 to sprinklers 8 may also be effected outside the sink if desired, a connector being provided at a convenient location.It is preferable to arrange a safety device so that the tap 12 cannot be operated if cover 6 is open.It is also within the scope of the present invention to effect the control of the water supply of the above arrangement electrically, the circuit including pressure gauges, timers, thermostates, if desired.It can be seen that an added advantage of the dish washer above described, lies in the fact that it is possible to wash large quantities or fruits or vegetables easily and quickly at one time.
