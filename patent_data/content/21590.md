# Refractory composition for forming a monolithic structure.

## Abstract
Sodium borate, preferably a hydrated sodium borate and most preferably borax the decahydrate , is added to a graphitic refractory composition suitable for forming a refractory monolith, for example a plastic or a ramming mix, in order to reduce the loss of plasticity of the mix during storage, to inhibit fungi formation in the mix during storage, and to improve the intermediate temperature strength of the composition.
