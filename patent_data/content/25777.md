# Wear resistant aluminium alloy and method of making same.

## Abstract
A wear resistant alloy of aluminium and an iron based material. The alloy contains from 10 to 60 by volume of the iron based material. The alloy has been created by very rapid surface heating of powder particles causing melting of the surface of the aluminium particles. The heating is produced by a shock wave pressure pulse. These surface regions are then very rapidly cooled by the rest of the particles so as to avoid chemical reactions between the aluminium particles and the particles of the iron based material. The time at high temperature is of the order of a few microseconds at most.
