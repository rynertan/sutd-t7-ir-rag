# Coal liquefaction process employing octahydrophenanthrene enriched solvent.

## Abstract
A coal solvation liquefaction process wherein the coal is contacted with hydrogen and an octahydrophenanthrene enriched solvent containing OHP and THP in a ratio of OHP THP greater than 0.4, wherein the OHP is present in an amount of at least 5 percent by weight based upon the total weight of said solvent. The OHP enriched solvent provides improved coal solva tion and increases the production of distillate liquid 62 in a coal solvation liquefaction 20,24 process. The desired ratio of OHP THP is provided by catalytic hydrogenation 68 of a coal liquid distillate stream 64 . By increasing the OHP THP ratio to a value greater than 1, the amount of hydrogen con sumed in the process can be significantly reduced.
