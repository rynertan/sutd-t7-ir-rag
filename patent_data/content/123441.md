# Vincaleukoblastine derivatives.

## Abstract
Compounds of the following formula are disclosed R O CO X CO Z wherein R is a dimeric indole dihydroindole radical derived from a 4 acetoxy or 4 hydroxy antineoplastic dimer indoledihydroindole alkaloid, wherein Z is OR wherein R is the same or different, OH, OC₁ ₃alkyl, NH₂, NHNH₂, an acylating group Z¹ or a carboxy protecting group Z² , and wherein X is C₁ ₄ straight chain alkylene, C₂ ₈branched alkylene, C₂ ₄alkenylene, C₃ ₄alkynylene, C₃ ₆cycloalkylene, phenylene, C₁ ₄hydroxy substituted C₁ ₄alkylene or a direct bond and acid addition salts thereof. The compounds in which Z is OR, OH, OC₁ ₃al kyl, NH₂ or NHNH₂ have utility as antitumor compounds and the remaining compounds are useful as intermedi ates in further synthesis.
