# IMPROVEMENTS IN AND RELATING TO OPTICAL COMPENSATORS FOR CINEMATOGRAPHY

## Abstract
A device compensates for the movement of a cinema tographic film moved continuously through a camera or projector. A plurality of separate inverting reflectors, typi cally Amici prisms 70 , move in the same direction as the film 20 but at one half the speed of the film. The path of the prisms 70 is determined by a straight line segment 74 of a track 72 , the staright line segment 74 being parallel to the direction of movement of the film 20 . A separate coupling between each facet and drive means permits relative movement between the facets as the move around the path. By illuminating the film over a width of at least one and a half frames using a condenser lens 18 so a num ber of partial images are obtained which are reconstituted in the optics so as to form in the projected image a com posite frame which in general will be made up of two or three images of frame parts from two or three adjoining frames.
