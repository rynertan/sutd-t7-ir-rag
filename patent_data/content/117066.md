# Scaffold platform.

## Abstract
A scaffold platform includes means 1 adapted to engage over a ridge of a roof which suspends a ladder like supporting frame 5 having a plurality of cross extending rungs 6 . A platform frame 8 is releaseably secured to one rung 6 and a pair of supporting legs 10 extend between the frame 8 and a lower rung 6 . The frame 8 and supporting legs 10 may be secured to others of the rungs 6 whereby the height of the platform may be varied.

## Claims
Claims 1. A scaffold platform comprising means for supportingly engaging a roof ridge, window opening or like horizontal edge, frame means suspendingly connected to the engaging means and comprising a plurality of cross extending members, a horizontally disposed platform means releasably secured to a first of said cross extending members, and supporting leg means connected at one end thereof to the platform means and at the other end thereof releasably to a second of said cross extending members, such that the platform means and leg means may be engaged with other of said cross extending members whereby to alter the level of the platform means. 2. A platform as claimed in claim 1 further comprising at least one guard rail on at least two sides thereof. 3. A platform as claimed in claim 1 or 2 comprising at least one stabilising strut connected between the engaging means and one of said cross extending members. 4. A platform as claimed any preceding claim wherein the leg means comprises a pair of legs connected between the platform means and the respetive cross extending member. 5. A platform as claimed in claim 4 wherein the legs are telescopically extendable. 6. A platform as claimed in any preceding claim wherein the means for supportingly engaging a roof or ridge or the like comprises inverted substantiallyU shaped members. 7. A platform as claimed in any preceding claim including weight spreading means mounted on the frame means and on the engaging means. 8. A platform as claimed in claim 7 wherein the weight spreading means comprises planks secured to the frame means and engaging means.

## Description
SCAFFOLD PLATFORM This invention relates to a scaffold platform which may be engaged with for example the ridge of a roof or a window opening to provide a working support surface adjacent thereto. A particular although not exclusive application of such a platform is to enable workmen to repoint repair or rebuild the tops of chimney stacks, but several other uses are envisaged such as working on the roof itself, on adjacent walls or even the erection of television aerials. According to the invention there is provided a scaffold platform comprising means for supportingly engaging a roof ridge, window opening or like horizontal edge, frame means suspendingly connected to the engaging means and comprising a plurality of cross extending members, a horizontally disposed platform means releasably secured to a first of said cross extending members, and supporting leg means connected at one end thereof to the platform means and at the other end thereof releasably to a second of said cross extending members, such that the platform means and leg means may be engaged with other of said cross extending members whereby to alter the level of the platform means. In this way it is possible to construct a scaffold platform of substantial rigidity and strength yet which may be flexibly adaptable to different uses.Furthermore, the platform means and leg means may be engaged with different,pairs of said cross extending members whereby to alterthelevel of the platform means. The platform means itself is preferably provided with at least one guard rail on at least two sides thereof for the protection of men working thereon. A further preferred feature of the invention is the provision of at least one and preferably two stabilising struts connected between the engaging means and one of said cross extending members. This can considerably increase the rigidity of the scaffold platform and lessen any tendency to slide down the pitch of a roof which could happen if the engaging means tended to pivot with respect to the remainder of the platform. The said leg means preferably comprises a pair of legs connected between the platform means and the respective member, and in a preferred arrangement these legs are telescopically extendable to allow for different configurations. To prevent damage to fragile roof claddings such as slates or pantiles, weight spreading means may be mounted on the frame means and preferably also on the engaging means. Such weight spreading means may for example comprise wooden planks clipped to the respective means. In order that the invention may be readily understood an embodiment thereof will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawing which shows a scaffold platform engaged on the roof cf a building with certain parts thereof omitted for the sake of clarity. The platform comprises a ridge engaging means 1 in the form of a pair of U shaped tubes 2 whose ends are cross connected by rods 3 to which are clipped weight spreading planks 4. Fixed to the engaging means,l saEsuspended ladder like frame 5 having a plurÅalityfòf cross extending rungs 6. Connected between oneidf these rungs 6 and the engaging.means 1 is a pair of bracing struts 7 which impart rigidity to the structure as hereinabove mentioned. The platform itself consists of a frame 8 over which will be applied but not shown a plywood deck on which one or more workmen may stand. Guard rails 9 are fixed to frame 8 for obvious reasons. The frame 8 is releasably connected at one end to the upper rung 6 of the frame 5 by means of snap hooks 20, and between its other end and the third rung down are provided a pair of telescopically extendable compression legs 10. The lower ends of the legs 10 are reasonably secured to the third rung by means of suitable clamps 21. The frame 8 and legs 10 may be releasably clamped to other rungs 6 if desired to achieve a different height or configuration of the platform. Weight spreading planks 11 are clipped to the main members of the frame 5 to prevent or minimise damage to the roof cladding. The scaffold platform is also able to be modified to suit different purposes. For example, for working lower down the roof pitch a further runged frame 5 may be connected to that shown and the platform itself connected to this further frame lower down.Again to raise the height of the man supporting surface a small tower may be mounted thereon in place of the guard rails 9 with an access ladder leading to a trapdoor in the deck. The scaffold platform disclosed is stable and strong, yet versatile in the differing levels of platform it allows. It may be constructed from light alloy tubing to be low in weight yet high in strength.
