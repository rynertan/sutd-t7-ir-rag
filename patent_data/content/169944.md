## Description
A MANIFOLD VALVE PARTICULARLY FOR MULTIPLE CIRCA HEATING SYSTEMS The present invention relates to a manifold valve particularly for multiple circuit heating systems. In conventional multiple circuit heating systems, the delivery and return ends of the individual circuits are connected to known delivery and return manifolds.For the purpose of providing an improved regulation of the hot water flow through radiators, also knovn is to associate automatic and shutter valves with said manifolds. Automatic valves are provided on the return manifold, and shutter valves are provided on the delivery or intake manifolds. The automatic valves may have any configurations which may suit automatic control, such as through an electric control, space thentiostat, and the like. prior embodinents of such automatic and shutter valves are of two part construction, namely one part accormodating the valve or valve shutter, and another part forming the cut off seat, said two parts being threaded into respective seats in the fitting at diametrically opposed and aligned locations. In order for such valves or shutter valves to operate properly, or to achieve a reliable closure in the cut off position, or position of engagement of the valve or shutter valve moving body with the cut off seat, the two parts of the valve must be mounted truly coaxial with each other.The manifold outer surfaces, moreover, must be precision machined since they form sealing surfaces. lSroviding two separate valve parts, mounting them in perfect coaxial relationship, and forming the sealing surfaces on the manifold involve expensive construction and assembling procedure. ihen it is considered, moreover, that the trend with multiple circuit heating systems favours a high number of independent circuits, it appears that each manifold is to be provided with a high number of branch connections for such circuits, e.g. on the order of 5 10 circuits. Thus, the two intake and discharge manifolds for such circuits require 20 to 40 coaxial seats, and attendant outer surface finishing, any faulty machining of one or more of such seats jeopardizing the manifold effectiveness.Another disadvantage of the prior embodiments is that assembling the two valve parts requires two threaded connections for each valve as well as several intermediate connection components. Besides being expensive to manufacture, all this involves long assembly times. This invention is directed to provide a manifold valve of the general type indicated herein above, which affords faultless coaxial movement of the moving valve part relatively to the cut off seat, is of simple construction with a limited number of components, and can speed up assembling without involving any special machining of the manifold outer surfaces. within the above general aim, it may be arranged that the valve of this invention brings about simpler machining of its supporting seats on the manifold.Further, in the instance ofiutte r valves, the shutter can be positioned at its selected position. Taking the steps from a manifold valve particularly for multiple circuit heating systems, which comprises a valve housing accommodating the valve movable body, the aim of this invention is achieved by a valve characterised in that a the valve housing accommodates the valve movable body axially therein, and has its sealing seat arranged to cooperate with said valve movable body b the valve housing is arranged to extend through the manifold body, and has at its ends coupling portions for engagement with corresponding seats formed in the manifold body c the valve housing is provided, downstream of the sealing seat, with passage windows for the fluid to be regulated d a sealing means is provided at the coupling portions e in the instance of shutter valves, an integral positioning means is provided for the shutter, as well as safety means preventing the shutter from coming out and a means of covering the same. According to another aspect of the invention, one coupling portion of the valve housing has threads for engagement with a threaded seat in the manifold, and the other coupling portion is made cylindrical for coupling into a cylindrical seat in the manifold. According to a further aspect of the invention, in the instance of a thermostat or the like valve, that end of the valve housing which has the threaded portion is provided with a seat housing said valve, and that end of the valve housing which has the cylindrical coupling portion is provided with a threaded seat on the manifold outside for engagement with with a fitting on the associated heating circuit pipe. According to another aspect of the invention, in the instance of a shuff r valve, in the end of the valve housing having the cylindrical coupling portion there is provided a shutter housing seat, and the end having the threaded coupling portion is provided with a fitting for receiving the associated heating circuit pipe. The sealing means, according to another aspect of the invention, comprises O rings accommodated in seats provided, respectively in the cylindrical coupling portions of the valve housing and in the threaded coupling seats of the manifold. According to a further aspect of the invention, the shutter positioning means consists of a threaded ring with a drive slot and a through hole for access to the underlying shutter by a spanner. According to still another aspect of the invention, the safety means consists of a collar formed at the shutter housing end and being turned inwards. The cover means provided consists, according to a further aspect of the invention, of a plastic covering cap inserted in said turned in collar. The proposed manifold valve affords both functional and constructional and assembling advantages.Sealing during cut off is faultlessly tight because the proposed solution results in the valve housing being a single piece construction and involving no problems of coaxial alignment of the movable part to the stationary seat. Construction wise, a single threaded coupling is provided between the manifold and valve, or the housing thereof, whilst the other coupling is accomplished by means of an easily manufactured cylindrical coupling. The fitting for the associated circuit pipe is formed, with shutter valves, directly in the valve housing, and with thermostat valves and the like, by means of a single, easily manufactured fitting. The bores for the manifold seats are made with a simple boring operation.Sealing by means of O rings is faultless and the seats for the latter can be machined in a simple conventional manner. The fluid passage ports are simply obtained by slotting. As brought out by practical tests, the valve housing practically does not alter the flow ratios. The outer surfaces of the manifolds require no further special machining since they no longer serve sealing surface functions. In addition to the valve and manifold being simpler and quicker to machine, assembling is also made faster and more reliable. This is due on the one side to the use of a small number of readily assembled components that require no relative adjustments, and on the other side, to the type of seal employed. Slithshutss valves, an additional advantage is that a means of locking the shutter at a desired position is provided, as well as a means effective to prevent the shutter from coming out. A further advantage is that a single spanner is provided for both adjusting the shutter and tightening the shutter locking means. With the proposed valve, also facilitated is storage,in that the valve components are fewer in number, that is, fewer are the components required to assemble the valve and the fittings for connection to the piping of the associated heating circuits. Further features, advantages and details of the manifold valve according to the invention will be more clearly understood from the following description, with reference to the accompanying drawings, showing preferred embodiments thereof by way of example only, and where figure 1 is a vertical cross section taken through a return manifold incorporating an automatic control valve, the shutter being shown in the closed position in the right hand half and in the fully open position in the left hand half of the figure figure 2 shows a similar cross sectional view taken through a delivery manifold incorporating a shutter valves the shutter being shown in its Sully open o ition in tke right hand half and in its c ooed position in tho left hand kslf ef th. figure 3 is 3 of a top plan toa o view a a shutter locating ring nut Figure 4 is a sectional view of a covering cap Figure 5 shows a spanner used ror adjusting the shutter and then locating it by moans of the ring nut. With reference to tho above drawing figures, where similar parts are designated with the same reference numerals, a manifold valve according to the invention is generally indicated at 1. The same includes a full diameter valve housing 2 and movable valve body, indicated at 3, in the instance of automatic valves Figure 1 , and at 4 in the instance of shutter valves Figure 2 . In both valves, the valve housing 2 is formed internally with a sealing seat 5 with which the moving valve body 3 or 4 cooperates. According to the invention, the valve housings 2 are fitted continuously through the manifold bodies, indicated at 6, 6a.With reference to Figure 1, at the ends of the valve housing 2, there are provided coupling portions 7 and 8 for engagement with corresponding seats 9 and 10 formed in the manifold body 6. with reference to Figure 1, i. e. to the automatic valve type of embodiment, it may be seen that the seat 9 in the manifold is a threaded seat, whereas the seat 10 is a cylindrical one. The portion 7 is also formed with an outside thread, whereas the coupling portion 8 is a cylindrical portion. Formed therein is a seat 11 accommodating an O ring seal 12, and the seat 9 is also formed with a seat 13 accommodating an O ring seal 14. Indicated at 15 are slots or windows for the fluid passage from the piping of the heating circuit schematically represented in dash lines at.16, from the valve housing into the manifold 6. It may also be seen from Figure 1 that the valve housing 2 is provided, at the top of the coupling portion 7, with a bearing collar 17 and, on its interior, with a threaded seat 18 for receiving the automatic valve, such as a thermostat one, known per se and no further discussed herein. On the fluid inlet side, as indicated by the arrow f, the cylindrical coupling portion 8 extends outwards to form a threaded tubular fitting 19. Associated therewith is a connection fitting 20. As brought out in the construction shown in Figure 1, owing to the use of the seals shown, the outer surfaces of the manifold body 6 which cooperate with the bearing collar 17 and connection fitting 20 no longer form seal surfaces, thereby they require no special machining. Reference is now made to Figure 2, where a shutter valve is used for the valve. The body of the delivery manifold is indicated at 6a. The valve housing 2 has, in this case, a first threaded coupling portion 21 and a second cylindrical coupling portion 22. The latter is accorrodated in the cylindrical seat 23 of the manifold body 6a, the threaded portion 21 being received in the threaded seat 24 of the manifold body 6a. Also formed therein is the seat 25 for the ring seal 26, an additional seal ring 27 being received in the seat 28 formed in the cylindrical portion 22.Inside said cylindrical portion 22, there is formed threaded seat 29 adapted to receive the shutter 4. acco. modated above the same is a locking and locating ring nut 30 formed with a driving slot 31. Indicated at 32 is a circular middle opening in the ring nut 30 for access by an Allen spanner 33 to engage nth the recessed hexagon 34 in the shutter 4. It may also be seen from Figure 2 that on the outer front of the cylindrical portion 22 there is formed a collar 35 which, after the shutter 4 and ring nut 30 have been inserted into the inside threaded seat 29, is turned in and prevents said ring nut, or shutter, from coming out. At the same time, said turned in collar 35 also acts as a retainer for a covering cap 36 Figure 4 .It may also be seen from Figure 2 that the threaded coupling portion 21 is extended to form a bearing collar 37, conveniently of hexagonal shape, and then form a threaded fitting 37a adapted to receive the return end of the piping 16 of the associated heating circuit. As is apparent fromFigure 5, the Allen spanner 33 has one end 38 in the shape of a cylinder having a middle overhang 39, also cylindrical in shape and having a slightly smaller diameter than the diameter of the port 32 in the ring nut 30, as well as two blade like side overhangs 40 adapted for insertion into the driving slot 31 of said ring nut 30. Not even in the instance of the shutter valve is it necessary to later machine the outside of the seat 24, because the seal is provided by theO ring seal 26. iMJhereas with the valve of Figure 1 operation is accomplished automatically, for adjusting the shutter 4, the latter will be first positioned using the hexagon end of the spinner 33, whereafter that position will be locked by engaging the ring nut 30 therewith, in locknut relationship, the ring nut being driven by means of the blade like overhangs 40. Thus, the position of the shutter 4 can be changed at any time by removing the closure cap 36. It may be appreciated from the foregoing that the manifold valves according to the invention can effectively achieve the invention objects and provide the above mentioned advantages of a functional, constructional and assembly nature. In practice, the individual parts mzy be all replaced with any technical and or functional equivalents thereof. As an example, the end portions following the engagement portions may have any fitting configurations, and the arrangement and number of the seals, as well as the shutter configuration, or type of the automatic valve employed may be selected as desired without departing from the protection scope of this invention. All of the features to be inferred from the specification, claims and drawings are regarded as material to this invention, either individually taken or in any desired combinations thereof.
