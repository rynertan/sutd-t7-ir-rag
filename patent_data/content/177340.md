# Improved apparatus for electrically isolated hot wire surfacing processes.

## Abstract
Welding apparatus which utilizes a preheating step in which the heat content of a consumable wire electrode is increased by means other than the welding current. A first source of electrical power for heating a consumable electrode, is connected to a first electrode contact tip having a bore therethrough, and a spaced second electrode contact tip having a bore therethrough a dielectric element having a bore therethrough is disposed between the first and second electrode contact tips. The bores are adapted to receive therethrough the consumable electrode for the application of electrical power thereto. The bore of at least one of the electrode contact tips is axially displaced relative to the electrode contact bore of the other electrode contact tip to improve electrical contact.
