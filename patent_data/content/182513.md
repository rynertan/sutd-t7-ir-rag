## Description
ENCAPSULATING PRODUCT This invention relates to an encapsulating product. In particular it relates to such a product which is useful for the uniform encapsulation of fragile objects such as electronic components and devices. In certain applications, such objects may be subjected to extreme stress and it is necessary to encapsulate them so that they can retain their function.Encapsulation is also useful for protection from other severe environments, such as corrosive atmospheres. In cases where it is necessary not to increase the weight of the encapsulated object unnecessarily, it is very useful to encapsulate the product in a foamed resin. Materials have been commercially available for some time for use in the encapsulation of fragile objects in a foam resin, but, generally, these foam resins are based on polyurethanes. The formation of a polyurethane foam in situ, involves, of course, the handling of somewhat hazardous chemicals and in particular the isocyanate components and it is an object of the present invention to provide a product capable of encapsulating fragile objects with a foamed resin which does not suffer from this particular disadvantage. It is a further object of the present invention to achieve, in an epoxy foam the advantages previously associated with polyurethane foams namely, the ability to blend, at room temperature, the reactants from which the foam is formed intimately and rapidly and, by proper selection of reactants to control the rate of reaction so that, whilst proceeding at a convenient rate, it does not become too fast and lead to a non uniformly foamed and or friable product. Yet a further object is to provide a product which will result in an encapsulated product which may be easily depotted by the use of simple solvents such as acetone. Accordingly, we provide a product capable of uniformly encapsulating fragile objects in an epoxy foam material, which product comprises a a liquid epoxy resin or blend of epoxy resins wherein up to 20 epoxy molar per cent of the epoxy groups may have been prereacted with a reactive material, the epoxy equivalent weight of said liquid being between 100 and 300 and the viscosity of said liquid, at 20 C being less than 200 Pas, preferably less than 50 Pas b a liquid comprising sufficent cross linking agent or blend of cross linking agents to react with at least 90 of the free epoxy groups in said resin or blend of resins,said cross linking agent or blend of cross linking agents including one or more polyamines or a polymercaptan, c A catalyst including one or more tertiary amines, a foaming agent and, preferably, a surfactant, wherein, on initial mixing of the components a , b and c there is formed a liquid which is mobile at 20 C. Conveniently, the product of the invention may be in the form Of first and second liquid compositions, the first liquid composition comprising the liquid epoxy resin or blend of epoxy resins referred to in a above together with a suitable foaming agent and surfactant and the second liquid composition comprising the cross linking agent or blend of cross linking agents and a catalyst. These first and second liquid compositions can be easily and intimately mixed, for example in a high speed, high shear mixer, and the resultant mobile liquid easily applied to the components to be encapsulated. The foaming and encapsulating auction is then found to proceed with reasonable speed, being completed in under 30 minutes, i.e.sufficiently fast to flow around the possibly fragile components, but not so fast as to cause any damage to the components during the encapsulating process. The relative reactivity of the materials used are selected so that a uniform, non friable foam is produced and so that the speed of reaction throughout the foam is relatively constant, thus to avoid the production of large voids or of charring. In free rise conditions, foaming occurs without the application of any external heat but when a mould of high thermal conductivity, e.g. of aluminium is used, it may be necessary to pre heat the mould and or moderately apply external heat during foaming. We prefer that the total molar equivalent of the reactive groups in the said resin or blend of resins should be in slight excess of the total molar equivalent of the reactive groups in said cross linking agent or agents. This of course means that any excess reactive groups are epoxy rather than active hydrogen such as amine or mercaptan and epoxy groups can homopolymerise in the presence of the tertiary amine catalysts leaving no unreacted groups so any risk of corrosion is minimised. It is also preferred, in one aspect of the invention that up to 20 molar equivalent per cent of the epoxy groups of said liquid resin or blend of resins should have been re reacted with a reactive material such as an aromatic polyamine. Examples of such an aromatic polyamine include diaminodiphenylmethane and diaminodimethylsulphone. Suitable liquid epoxy resins are those derived from a diglycidyl ether of bis phenol A having an epoxy equivalent weight of from 180 to 250 and, where a blend of epoxy resins are used, this may comprise an epoxy resin derived from a diglycidyl ether of bis phenol A and an epoxy Novalac resin having an epoxy equivalent weight of from 150 to 200 and or an N glycidylamine having an epoxy equivalent weight of from 100 to 150 and containing up to 50 molar per cent blended epoxy groups, the blend having a total epoxy equivalent weight of from 145 to 250. Most usefully, the epoxy equivalent weight of said liquid epoxy resin is between 180 and 200 and the viscosity of said liquid is between 9 and 100 Pas. The cross linking agent or blend of cross linking agents in the liquid referred to under b above may be one or more polyamines. Preferably a blend is employed and comprises a first polyamine of molar equivalent weight less than 30 and a second polyamine of molar equivalent weight greater than 90 wherein the molecular ratio of reactive groupings in said first polymine as compared with said second polyamine is between 10 1 and 4 1. A preferred example of the first polyamine is diethylenetriamine. Suitable materials for use as the second polyamine include an aliphatic polyether diamine such as a polyoxypropylene diamine of molar equivalent weight 500. An aromatic polyamine such as diaminodiphenylmethane may be added as a third polyamine if not used in an adduct. Alternatively, the cross linking agent may be a polymercaptan such as an aliphatic trimercaptan of molar equivalent weight between 100 and 300. The catalyst may preferably be an amine accelerator such asAncamine AD which is a blend of modified aliphatic amines with tertiary amine and phenolic accelerators or a tertiary amine such as triethanolamine or tris dimethylnminomethyl phenol. We have found that the most convenient blowing agent is trichlorofluoromethane, and, as surfactant, a silicone glycol copolymer or a polyoxyethylene sorbitan soap. The preferred second liquid composition comprising the cross linking agent or blend of cross linking agents and a catalyst will conveniently have a viscosity less than 20 Pas and, typically, less than 1 Pas. According to our invention we also provide an epoxy foam material produced by mixing the components a , b and c and allowing them to react. The resultant foam has a compressive strength as measured according to British Standard No. 4370 of from 0.2 to 1.0 MN m√™, preferably 0.5 to 1.0 MN m√™ a density of from 0.05 to 0.30 g cm , preferably 0.05 to 0.15 g cm and a dimensional stability as measured according toBritish Standard No. 4370 of less than 3.0 .Other properties possessed by materials having a density between 0.05 and 0.15g cm include a volume resistivity as measured according to British Standard No. 903 of from 0.05.1012 to 4.0.1012 ohm.m a thermal conductivity of from 0.03 to 0.05 W mK a dielectric constant at 1.4 GHz of from 1.10 to 1.20 and a tan of not more than 0.006. Furthermore the foam can be easily broken down by simple solvents, such as acetone, which is of course useful for the recovery, without serious damage, of any encapsulated components. We further provide an assembly comprising an electronic component encapsulated in the epoxy foam of this invention and a final aspect of our invention is the individual materials which are suitable for use as the first liquid composition or as the second liquid composition in the product of our invention. The invention will now be described but is in no way limited by the following examples.
