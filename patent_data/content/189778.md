# Circuit board with integral connector.

## Abstract
A printed circuit board 1 formed of plastic material, with an upper surface 9, a bottom surface 10 and a plurality of side edges, with conductive paths 11 being provided on the upper surface 9 and or bottom surface 10 to electrically connect the components to be mounted on such surface. A connector 2 having an insulating body 4 is provided on the circuit board 1 and in which reside contact elements 5 with terminal ends 13 and contact ends 12. The terminal ends 13 are in electrical connection with predetermined conductive paths 11 for providing a connection to the outside of the board. The circuit board 1 and the insulating body 4 of the connector 2 are integrally formed.
