# Superconducting soliton device.

## Abstract
Josephson solitons are steered along selected paths in response to applied control signals, the output path chosen being dependent solely upon the presence and absence of these control signals. An input Josephson transmission line 46 is provided along which the Josephson soliton S travels. This input line intersects with two output Josephson transmission lines 50, 54 . Bias currents I
