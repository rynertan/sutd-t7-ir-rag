# Operation teaching method and apparatus for industrial robot.

## Abstract
An operation teaching method and apparatus for an industrial robot adapted to be successively moved to and set at different positions along an objective structure to conduct a predetermined operation on working objects of the same con figuration on the objective structure to which objects the dif ferent positions correspond, respectively. The data taught at an initial position is corrected through a coordinate transfor mation between a coordinate system fixed on a working object and a coordinate system assumed on the robot, and the corrected data are reproduced and used as the operation data for the second and the following working positions.
