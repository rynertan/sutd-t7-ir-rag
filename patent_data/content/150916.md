# Shielded arc welding.

## Abstract
Shielded arc welding apparatus comprises a wire feed sys tem 18A for advancing a consumable electrode 14 towards a workpiece 13 . A power supply 16 applies a welding volt age between the electrode 14 and the workpiece 13 . A me dium voltage supply 22 applies an auxiliary voltage between the electrode 14 and the workpiece 13 , the auxiliary voltage being such that the arc is initiated in use before the electrode 14 engages the workpiece 13 .
