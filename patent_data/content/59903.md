In addition, the nitrogen atoms in groups R, R1 and R2 may also form quaternary salts and N oxides. As stated above, the compounds represented by formula 1 have been found to have pharmacological activity in the animal body as antagonists to certain actions of histamine which are not blocked by antihistamines such as mepyramine. For example, they have been found to inhibit selectively the histamine stimulated secretion of gastric acid from in the stomach of chronic fistula dogs at doses of from 0.001 to 5 mg per kilogram intravenously, or orally from 0.01 to 10 mg per kilogram. Similarly, the action of these compounds is demonstrated by their antagonism to the effects of histamine on other tissues which are not affected by histamine H1 antagonists. An example of such tissue is the isolated guinea pig right atrium.The compounds of the invention have also been found to inhibit the secretion of gastric acid stimulated by pentagastrin or by food. The pharmaceutical carrier employed may be for example, either a solid or liquid. Exemplary of solid carriers are lactose, terra alba, sucrose, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, stearic acid and the like. Exemplary of liquid carriers are syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, water and the like. A wide variety of pharmaceutical forms can be employed. Thus, if a solid carrier is used, the preparation can be tableted, placed in a hard gelatin capsule in powder or pellet form, or in the form of a troche or lozenge. The amount of solid carrier will vary widely but preferably will be from about 15 mg to about 0.4 gm. If a liquid carrier is used, the preparation may be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule, sterile injectable liquid such as an ampoule, or an aqueous of nonaqueous liquid suspension. The pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by conventional techniques involving procedures such as mixing, granulating and compressing or dissolving the ingredients as appropriate to the desired preparation. The active ingredient will be present in the composition in an effective amount to inhibit histamine activity. The route of administration may be orally or parenterally. Preferably, each dosage unit will contain the active ingredient in an amount of from about 1 mg to about 500 mg most preferably from about 20 mg to about 200 mg given in a single dose or multiple divided doses. For therapeutic use, the pharmacologically active compounds of the present invention will normally be administered as a pharmaceutical composition comprising, as the essential active ingredient, at least one such compound in the basic form or in the form of an addition salt with a pharmaceutically acceptable acid and in association with a pharmaceutical carrier therefor. Such addition salts include those mentioned above. Other pharmacologically active compounds may in certain cases be included in the composition.It may be appropriate to combine the instant compound or compounds with anticholinergic agents such as propantheline H1 antihistamines such mepyramine, pyribenzamine, chloropheniramine and the like or prostanoids. Advantageously the composition will be made up in a dosage unit form appropriate to the desired mode of administration, for example as a tablet, capsule, or injectable solution. The compounds of the present invention may be made by reacting a suitably substituted N cyano 3methylisothiourea with hydroxylamine optionally followed by alkylation of the derived diaminooxadiazoles as outlined in the following reaction schemes I and II. REACTION SCHEME IEMI10.1 REACTION SCHEME IIEMI11.1 wherein R, , X, n, m, R1 and R2 are as previously defined. The first step of the reaction involves the reaction of the N cyano S methylisothiourea III with hydroxylamine. The hydroxylamine is generally added to the reaction mixture as a salt, preferably the hydrochloride salt, and the free base generated in situ.The hydroxylamine free base is liberated using a base added to the reaction mixture. Any base strong enough to remove the salt from the hydroxylamine is suitable and both organic bases such as tertiary amines and inorganic bases have been used. The preferred bases are pyridine, triethylamine, an alkali metal alkoxide such as sodium or potassium methoxides or ethoxide. The base is required to be present in a single molar equivalent, however, excess base has not been found to be detrimental. Alternatively, the hydroxylamine free base may be pregenerated and added to the reaction mixture without any added base in the form of a solution thereof. The reaction may also be carried out using hydroxylamine salts, however, yields are diminished and variable. It is preferred to carry out the reaction with a hydroxylamine salt and to liberate the free base in situ. The reaction is carried out in a polar or non polar solvent and the choice of solvent somewhat determines the nature of the products obtained. If a non polar solvent is employed, such as tetrahydrofuran, ether, benzene and the like, compound IV A is the product formed almost exclusively. That is the product of Formula I wherein Y is 0 and Z is N . If a polar solvent is used, such as a loweralkanol, preferably methanol or ethanol, a mixture of compoundsIV A and IV B is obtained. The mixture is readily separated chromatographically using any of the generally used chromatographic techniques such as thin layer preparative layer, column, high pressure liquid chromatography and the like. The support medium may be alumina, silica gel, ion exchange resins, dextran gels and the like. With either polar or non polar solvents, the reaction is carried out from room temperature to the reflux temperature of the reaction medium. It is preferred to carry out the reaction at room temperature.The reaction is slow and reaction times of from 2 days to 2 weeks are not uncommon. The progress of the reaction is conveniently monitored using thin layer chromatographic analysis of an aliquot of the reaction mixture. Using this technique many reactions have been found to reach a point of no further reaction in about 4 5 days. The products are isolated using techniques known to those skilled in the art. The products of the first step of the reaction have the unsubstituted amine function on the 3 position IV A or 5 position IV B of the oxadiazole moiety. The 3 amino function of IV A when R8 is other than hydrogen is substituted with the R1 and R2 groups by reaction with a strong base such as an alkali metal alkoxide, preferably sodium or potassium methoxide or ethoxide or an alkali metal hydride, preferably sodium or potassium hydride. The reaction is carried out in a solvent such as N,N dimethyl formamide or tetrahydrofuran. The alkali metal salt thus produced is then reacted with anR1 or R2 halide wherein R1 and R2 are as previously defined. The compounds IV A wherein R8 is loweralkyl are prepared directly from compound III when R8 is loweralkyl or from the compounds IV A wherein R8 is hydrogen using the same procedure as described above for the preparation of those compounds wherein R1 and R2 are other than hydrogen. Hydrogen atoms on the 5 nitrogen substituent of the diaminooxadiazole are more acidic than those on the 3nitrogen substituent. Thus, such groups must be blocked with a protecting group before alkylation can be carried out on the 3 nitrogen substituent. Preferred protecting groups are aralkoxy, preferably benzyloxymethyl, prepared from the corresponding halide using conventional techniques. The conversion of IV A to V A requires the blocking of the internal 5 nitrogen substituent with similar protecting groups, followed by subsequent alkylation with R1 or R2 halides. The protecting group is removed by acid hydrolysis with aqueous acid. The N cyano S methylisothiourea starting materials are all known compounds fully described in the prior art discussed above. Thus, processes for their preparation need not be described here. The following examples are provided in order that this invention might be more fully understood.They are not to be construed as limitative of the invention.
