# An improved hydraulic wrench.

## Abstract
A hydraulically operated wrench which can be used either for simultaneously tightening or loosening two threaded con nectors or to apply the full force of the wrench to tighten or loosen only a single threaded connector. The wrench includes a cylinder 1 and a piston 3 reciprocating therein, connecting means 9 connected to the cylinder 1 , a drive lever 11 mounted intermediate its ends on the connecting means 9 for pivoting about a first pivot axis A₁ and operatively connected at one end to the piston 3 while being provided at the other end with a polygonal opening for engaging a polygonal member of a first threaded connector to be turned. A drive link 29 pro vided at one end with a polygonal opening for drivingly en gaging a polygonal member of a second threaded connector to be turned and an anchoring link 30 provided at one end with an opening for turnably surrounding the polygonal member of the second theraded connector may be selectively attached at the other end to the connecting means 9 for pivoting about a second pivot axis A₂ spaced from and parallel to the first pivot axis A₁ . The wrench may also incorporate an arrangement for exactly changing the distance between the first and the second axes A₁ and A₂ .
