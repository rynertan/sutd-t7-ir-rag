# Surface modified electrode and its use in a bioelectrochemical process.

## Abstract
In a bioelechemical process in which the electrons are transferred directly, without use of a mediator, such as a redox dye or cofactor, between an electrode and an elec troactive biological material, such as an enzyme or a protein, in either direction, rapid electron transfer has previously been achieved between an electrode and the positively charged protein horse heart cytochrome c by adding a surface modifier such as 4,4 bipyridyl or a derivative there of. It has now been found possible to promote electron transfer to either a positively or a negatively charged protein using the same surface modifier for either job, namely a com pound of formula
