# Cross linked polymer compositions and production thereof.

## Abstract
A method for forming a three dimensional network containing encapsulated organic material comprises reacting a functionalised polymer and a complementary functional cross linking agent both being miscible with, and preferably soluble in, the organic material in the presence of the organic material, which may be hydrocarbons and, particularly, oil. A two pack composition of the functionalised polymer and the cross linking agent is also claimed. The method and composition may be used for recovering oil spilled on sea and land, for treating organic wastes or for preventing leakage of oil from tanks or pipelines.
