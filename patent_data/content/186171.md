# Operating device for circuit breakers.

## Abstract
Operating device for circuit breakers comprising an opening spring 1 and a closing spring 2 , which preferably are both of the spirally wound flat rod or ribbon type and exert a torsional moment on each one of two shafts 3, 4 which are aligned. The shaft 3 of the opening spring 1 is connected to the circuit breaker via a lever 31 . The closing spring 2 is mounted in a rotatable cylinder 21 and can be tensioned by rotating the cylinder 21 by means of a motor 22 . The shaft 4 of the closing spring 2 is kept locked by a closing latch 8 which hooks up one of the arms of a star wheel 6 . Closing of the circuit breaker and simultaneous tensioning of the opening spring 1 are performed by releasing the closing latch 8 , whereby another one of the arms of the star wheel 6 engages a carrier latch 53 on the shaft 3 of the opening spring 1 and rotates this through an angle corresponding to one step on the star wheel 6 . The carrier latch 53 is thereafter disengaged, whereby the shaft 3 of the opening spring 1 is hooked up on an opening latch 7 and the circuit breaker is ready for an opening operation. Immediately after the disengagement, the next arm of the star wheel 6 is hooked up on the closing latch 8 , and the motor 22 is able to tension the closing spring 2 again.

## Description
Operating device for circuit breakersThe invention relates to an operating device for circuit breakers according to the precharacterising part of claim 1.The operating device is primarily intended for metal enclosed circuit breakers, insulated with sulphurhexafluoride SF6 gas, but it may be used for other types of circuit breakers as well. The opening operation of puffer type SF circuit breakers 6 requires considerable operating energy. Since, in addition, short operating times are required, the movable parts of the operating device should be designed with as little a mass as possible. It is known to use for such operation pneumatic or hydraulic operating devices with pressurized gas as energy accumulator. However, such operating devices with associated compressors, pumps and other auxiliary equipment are relatively expensive. Normally, therefore, mechanical operating devices working without compressed air are preferred.Most of the prior art designs of such mechanical operating devices include helical springs as energy accumulating means see e.g. GB A 1,273,014 . Such springs require large space in relation to the energy they can store. This means that an operating device with such springs considerably increases the floor or ground surface required for the system consisting of the circuit breaker and the operating device. This is particularly true of SF6 circuit breakers of the kind encap sulated in an earthed metal enclosure in the form of cyiin drical tanks positioned near the floor or the ground, and in which the operating device, which is usually in the form of a cubicle, is placed adjacent the circuit breaker.Another drawback with many operating devices having helical closing springs is that a not insignificant energy loss takes place during the power transmission from the closing spring to the circuit breaker, since the linear movement of the spring is first transformed into a rotating movement which is then transformed back into a linear movement in the circuit breaker. Furthermore, such operating devices must normally be provided with dampers for taking up the remaining kinetic energy on reaching the end positions.Operating devices with a spirally wound flat rod as closing spring are already known per se. In such a device described in DE B 1 064 598, a mechanism consisting of a cam disc and a plurality of shafts and links is used for the connection between the spring and the circuit breaker. Such a design requires large space.The invention aims at developing an operating device of the above mentioned kind which requires less space in the horizontal plane than comparable prior art designs and which is especially suitable for use for SF6 circuit breakers with an earthed metal tank enclosure.To achieve this aim the invention suggests an operating device for circuit breakers according to the introductory part of claim 1, which is characterized by the features of the characterizing part of claim 1.Further developments of the invention are characterized by the features of the additional claims. Since the two force transmitting shafts of the operating device according to the invention are arranged aligned with each other and provided with an connection mechanism of the kind stated in claim 1, the operating device can advantageously be placed below the circuit breaker, which eliminates the need of special floor or ground space for the operating device.An exceedingly suitable embodiment of the invention is characterized in that both the opening spring and the closing spring of the operating device are of the spirally wound flat rod or ribbon type. With such springs an extremely compact embodiment of the operating device, in relation to its operating energy storing capacity, is achievable.Since the transmission between the operating device and the circuit breaker takes place by direct connection without chains or the like and with a minimum of link connections, the energy losses in the transmission will be small.The invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings showing by way of example inFigure 1 schematically in perspective view of an operating device according to the invention Figure 2 movement curves for the two power transmitting shafts of the operating device Figure 3 an embodiment of the connection mechanism of the shafts in an end view in its first fixed position corresponding to the open position of the circuit breaker Figure 4 the embodiment of the connection mechanism of Fig ure 3 in its second fixed position corresponding to the closed position of the circuit breaker.The operating device shown in Figure 1 is built into a mechanism housing not shown and comprises an opening spring 1 and a closing spring 2. Both springs are of the spirally wound flat rod or ribbon type, and each spring exerts a torsional moment on a corresponding shaft, namely, an operating shaft 3 and a driving shaft 4, respectively. The shafts 3 and 4 are aligned with each other, and their confronting ends are provided with a connection mechanism comprising a star wheel 6 fixed on the driving shaft 4 and a two armed carrier 5 fixed on the operating shaft 3. One arm 51 of the carrier 5 supports a carrier latch 53 which cooperates with the star wheel 6, the second arm 52 being arranged to cooperate with an opening latch 7. The operating shaft 3 is connected to the circuit breaker by way of a lever 31 and a linkage not shown . When the circuit breaker is closed, the opening spring 1 is tensioned and its shaft 3 hooked up on the opening latch 7. This position of the shaft, which corresponds to the closed position of the circuit breaker, is shown in unbroken lines in Figure 1. On giving an opening impulse, the opening latch 7 is released, and the opening spring 1 rotates the shaft 3 so that the circuit breaker is opened. This causes the shaft 3 to assume the end position shown in broken lines in Figure 1, which thus corresponds to the open position of the circuit breaker. Thus, the operating shaft 3 operates back and forth between the two shown fixed positions.The closing spring 2 has its inner end fixed to the driving shaft 4 and its outer end fixed to a member 21 rotatable on the driving shaft 4, said member 21 suitably consisting of a wheel or a cylindrical drum surrounding the spring 2. The spring 2 can be tensioned by rotating the drum with the aid of a motor 22 via a suitable transmission means, for example a belt 23. The shaft is kept locked by a closing latch 8 which hooks up one of the arms of the star wheel 6. Closing of the circuit breaker takes place by releasing the closing latch 8, whereby another one of the arms of the star wheel 6 engages with the carrier latch 53 of the operating shaft 3 and rotates the latter through an angle corresponding to one step of the star wheel 6, which represents the movement of the entire operating shaft.When the carrier arm 52 has passed the opening latch 7, the carrier latch 53 is disengaged by an disengaging projection 9 Figure 4 fixedly arranged in the mechanism housing. The operating shaft 3 with its tensioned opening spring 1 then assumes a hooked up position, and the circuit breaker is ready for an opening operation. Immediately after disengagement of the carrier latch 53, the next arm of the star wheel 6 is hooked up on the closing latch 8, and the motor 22 is able to tension the closing spring 2 again. The star wheel 6 may have two, three, four or more arms, depending on whether the operating shaft 3 with its spring 1 has been designed for a torsional angle of 1800, 1200, 900, etc.To clarify the mode of operation of the operating device,Figure 2 shows functions of the torsional angle of the operating shaft 3 and for the three arms 61 63 of the star wheel 6 plotted against the time t during three successive closing and opening operations. The movement curve of the operating shaft 3 is drawn in unbroken line, whereas the curves for the arms 61, 62 and 63 are drawn in dashed, dashdotted and double dotted dashed lines, respectively. The star wheel 6 has three fixed positions per turn, namely, o 00, i 1200, and 2400. The rotation always takes place in the same direction.The operating shaft 3 has two fixed positions, namely, alpha which corresponds to the open position of the circuit breaker, and alpha alpha 2 2 which corresponds to the closed posi tion of the circuit breaker. The operating shaft 3 rotates back and forth between these two positions.Upon a closing operation, the closing latch 8 is released at the time tl. The star wheel 6 then starts rotating and the arm 61 engages the carrier latch 53 at alpha i1. Thereafter, the two shafts rotate synchronously during the closing operaction At alpha 3, the carrier latch 53 is disengaged when it passes the above mentioned fixed disengaging projection 9. The operating shaft 3 then turns and is hooked up in the angular position alpha alpha 2 at time t2 whereas the star wheel 6 continues to rotate and is hooked up in the angular position alpha 2400, which corresponds to 120 for the next arm 62. After this, the device is ready to make an opening operation, which in the example shown is performed between times t3 and t4.In addition, the drive motor 22 starts and tensions the closing spring, the device then being ready for the next closing operation. This time the arm 62 engages the carrier latch 53, and the procedure is repeated.Figures 3 and 4 show in more detail an embodiment of the connection mechanism between the two shafts 3, 4, namely, when the system circuit breaker and operating device is in the open position Figure 3 , and when the system is in the closed position Figure 4 . In the embodiment according toFigures 3 and 4, the star wheel 6 is provided with four arms 61 64, but otherwise this embodiment does not differ from the one shown in Figure 1. Of the parts shown in Figures 3 and 4 which are included in the coupling mechanism, the car rier latch 5 and the opening latch 7 are positioned in a rear plane, whereas the star wheel 6, the closing latch 8 and the carrier latch 53 are positioned in an front plane. In the example shown, the latch means 7 and 8 consist of roller type ratchets, which can be released by an opening and closing magnet, respectively not shown . The carrier latch 53 consists of two cascade connected roller type ratchets 53, 54, which are released when a sliding surface 55 on the smaller latch 54 contacts the stationarily arranged disengaging projection 9.The free end portion of the carrier arm 52 is provided with a spring loaded locking flap 56, which is arranged so that the arm 52 can pass freely past the opening latch 7 by the back way.Each one of the springs 1 and 2 may consist of a plurality of spiral spring elements arranged adjacent each other.
