# Optical apparatus for writing and or reading recording tracks by means of a radiation beam.

## Abstract
An optical apparatus 1 for reading a recording track on an optical disc 3 comprises an objective 6 which, by means of a combined bearing arrangement, can perform translational movements 12 for focussing a light beam 2 on the disc and pivotal movements 13, 14 for following the recording track in a radial and eventually also a tangential direction. The combined bearing arrangement comprises a plain bearing with a stationary member 17 having a convex outer bearing surface 18 and a cylindrical moving member 19 which, relative to the stationary member, moves in a sliding and a pivoting manner.
