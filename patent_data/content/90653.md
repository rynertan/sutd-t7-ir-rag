# Processes for producing and casting ductile and compacted graphite cast irons.

## Abstract
The present invention is directed to processes and appa ratus for carrying out said processes wherein molten cast iron is treated with a predominately iron alloy having the essential elements by weight of from 0.1 to about 10.0 silicon and about 0.5 to about 4.0 magnesium. The alloy may comprise from about 0.1 to about 10.0 silicon, about 0.5 to about 4.0 magnesium, up to about 2.0 of one or more rare earth elements such as cerium about 0.5 to about 6.5 carbon, the balance being iron. Small amounts of calcium, barium or stron tium and trace elements customarily found in conventional raw material may be present in the alloy. The characteristics of the alloy make it possible to establish a ready supply of treated mol ten iron in the foundry in holding vessels with a selected chemi cal composition at a given temperature. It also makes possible semi continuous and continuous casting of ductile and com pacted graphite cast irons.
