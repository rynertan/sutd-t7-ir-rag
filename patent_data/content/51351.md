## Description
A PANEL JOINING SYSTEM The present invention deals with a new panel joining system which is specifically applicable to prefabricated panels of the kind where two metal or plastic sheets are arranged parallel to one another, and the gap between them filled with a material to afford the panel heat and or sound insulation properties, in addition to increa sing its stiffness as a whole. Spanish Patents Nos. 313,883 and 377,036 are concerned with panels of this type, where there are male or tongued panels, and female or grooved panels. The joint between these panels, such as it is specified for example in Spanish Patent No. 313,883, involves the need to use a joint cover, but for the purpose of executing the joint, bulges are provided at right angles with respect to the surface of the panel along its outside edge, its inside edge, or both its edges together. These bulges are secured together using any kind of clip which will draw these bulges towards one another and simultaneously conceal the seal which must necessarily be made between them. This arrangement entails an obvious waste of material, and may even become an unsurmountable difficulty, rendering such panels unsuitable for the application in question when a smooth inside or outside surface is required. Other attempts have also been made to achieve a joint between panels which is smooth on the outside face at least. These arrangements have not been successfully put into practice up to now, because in addition to the difficulties they involve for proper alignment, the joint so accomplished is not tight. The panel joining system covered by this invention overcomes the disadvantages that at present exist, since it achieves absolute tightness at the join both on the outside and the inside or on the edges thereof, and therefore allows panels of this kind to be employed in all types of environment, including damp environments and loca tions that are subject to condensation. The panel joining system covered by the invention is based upon the existence of at least one face of the panels to be joined, of at least two pairs of grooves, where one has the purpose of accommodating the fastening means screws , and the other, being located towards the inside of each panel, close by to the first groove described and likewise having the possibility of being made on either or both faces of the panel , serving the purpose of a drain groove, which moreover accurately accommodates a join cover which, being mounted by way preferably of insertion under simple pressure, finally encloses the join. This join covers exerts further more a compressive force, which tends to draw the panels to be joined towards one another. In accordance with another feature of the invention, this join is accomplished by means of load spreader plates which may be arranged on either or both sides of the join, and which in turn are shaped so as to lie upon flat or uneven surfaces, and in either case are adapted to the form of the join, in whose grooves they are inser ted by the application of pressure, and where said join is completed by means of fasteners generally screws which hold such load spreader plates against the panel . Said screws secure the assembled join in said panels after assembly in their working location. These load spreader plates are pressure assembled in the grooves which are concealed by the joint cover inserted inside the grooves that are devised as water drainage channels , and carry the securing screws which also apply a compression force which tends to draw the panels to be joined towards one another in order to enhance the efficiency of the seal and avoid the passage of water, air, dampness or similar elements. The surface of the panel that lies between the two grooves the inner one belonging to the actual join, and the outer one carrying the seal and devised as a water drainage channel is slightly set back with respect to the wall which is defined by the panel, so that when the joint cover is located in position, the outer surface thereof lies in perfect alignment with the two panels and provides solely two plain surfaces belonging respectively to the two faces of the panels. In accordance with another feature of the invention, these panels are designed either with totally smooth surfaces, or provided with staggered trapezial gaps, with pressed holes, ornamental holes or similar, where these peculiarities have no effect other than to change the structural strength of the plates making up the panels, and in no way alter the essential features of the invention. The joining system envisaged under the present invention inclu des panels of the kind described which, upon their sides, possess a special shape which enables the join to be made between two of them when placed consecutively in line as intended under the invention.Such special shape on the sides allows seals to be inserted, these preferably being made from neoprene, aluminium fÃ³il or plastic, and which serve the dual purpose of holding the fill or insulation material in place between the two outside sheets while the panels are being manufactured, and to attain additional sealing properties at the sides to prevent any communication between this insulation or fill material and the outside of the panels, so as to avoid dampness. Figure 1 is an elevational section of a practical construction of the panel joining system being dealt with here. Figure 1 bis shows the same practical construction of the panel joining system as in Figure 1, except that here it is applied to panels having totally smooth faces. Figure 2 is an elevational section view in exactly the same arrangement as above, but here the join as covered by the invention is symmetrical with respect to its horizontal axis, and hence sealed at both sides of the panels. This practical construction of the invention is particularly appropriate for use in humid environments, since the inside of the panels cannot suffer any damage from dampness because said panels are totally sealed. Figure 2 bis shows the same practical construction of the panel joining system as in Figure 2, except that here it is applied to panels having totally smooth faces. Figure 3 is an elevation and plan view of the construction of a load spreader plate which embodies the constructions shown inFigures 1 and 2. Figure 4 depicts an elevational section view of another practi cal construction of the joining system being dealt with here. Figure 4 bis shows the same practical construction of the panel joining system as in Figure 4, except that here it is applied to panels having totally smooth faces. Figure 5 shows an identical elevational view to that in Figure 4 of a similar construction, but here the joining system is applied to both faces so that there is a total seal with respect to the insi de of the panels. Figure 5 bis shows the same practical construction of the panel joining system as in Figure 5, except that here it is applied to panels having totally smooth faces. Figure 6 is an elevation and a plan view of the load spreader plate which is included in the constructions illustrated in Figures 4 and 5. Figure 7 illustrates a practical construction of the panel joining system covered by this invention where the panels, being in identical arrangement to that shown in Figure 4, the load spreader plate possesses a different shape where the join in this case can be accomplished with the same degree of efficiency , but with a single coupling screw only. Figure 7 bis shows the same practical construction of the panel joining system as in Figure 7, except that here it is applied to panels having totally smooth faces. Figure 8 illustrates a further practical construction of the panel joining system as covered by the present invention where a further screw is applied with the possibility of including a nut, although on symmetrical shaped panels only. Figure 8 bis shows the same practical construction of the panel joining system as in Figure 8, except that here it is applied to panels having totally smooth faces. Figure 9 depicts an elevation and plan view of the load spreader plate as required in the practical constructions illustrated inFigures 7 and 8. Figure 10 illustrates a cross section view of a practical construction of the present invention as applied to panels fitted with stiffener ribs upon one of the side sheets that comprise them only. Side sealing between these panels is ensured in the case illustrated here, by a different structuring of the side seals themselves neoprene, aluminium foil or similar . Figure 11 shows a cross section view of a practical construction of the panel joining system as covered by the invention, applied here to panels whose side sheets are smooth and the shapes for accomplishing the join are present on the sheets belonging to one face only. It is to be noted that all the practical constructions illustrated are liable to be applied to all kinds of prefabricated panels with the sole requirement that the shapes shown in the drawings or others which do not substantially alter the technical features afforded by these constructions must be provided along their edges or machined thereon in a subsequent stage . The panel joining system as dealt with by this invention is for panels 1 which are comprised of two sheets between which a fill material is inserted. According to what system under the invention is being used, then, in addition to these panels 1 to be joined, at least one load spreader plate 2 secured to both panels 1 to be joined, and at least one means of fastening 3 generally a screw are required. In the practical construction illustrated in Figures 1 and lbis, panels 1 to be joined are symmetrical with respect to a perpendicular axis thereto, and their outer sheets between which the fill material is inserted have open trapezial grooves. Each one of said panels 1 possesses an inverted U shaped groove 11 on one of its faces, where the arm closest to the end of the panel is slightly sloped, and on the opposite face it possesses two successive grooves 12 and 13 . Groove 12 has the same shape as groove 11 on the opposite face, while the lower side of groove 13 defines an inside flat with respect to the panels when same are assembled together. Likewise, the flat defined from grooves 11 towards the edge of each panel 1 , and the flat defined between the two grooves 12 and 13 on the opposite face, are slightly set back with respect to the general plane of the panels. Four sided load spreader plate 2 is generally U shaped in this practical construction of the invention as may be appreciated from Figure 3 in the drawings, and its flanges 21 are slightly divergent, while a hole 20 is provided in its web. In tis practical construction, when both panels 1 are arranged side by side, the four sided load spreader plate 2 is inserted so that each one of its flanges engages on the sloping side of groove 13 so as to tend to draw panels 1 towards one another.The present practical construction of the system being dealt with is completed by inserting a fastening means screw 3 into the hole 20 provided in plate 2 , in such a way that this screw 3 goes through said plate 2 and one of panels 1 and emerges at the other side, where it will terminate on the appropriate section, frame or structure upon which the panels are assembled with this joining system. The invention is completed in this practical construction thereof, with two joint covers 4 which being arranged upon either side of these panels 1 as mentioned, are inserted by pressing into the appropriate pairs of grooves 11 and 12 , and the web of each such joint cover lies in perfect alignment with the general side plane of the assembled panels so as to provide perfect continuity over the join. Insofar as the side of each panel is concerned, this forms a U shape 14 and a fold 16 between which a seal 15 made of neoprene, aluminium foil or similar is held. Said seal 15 is subsequently positioned due to the effect of the panels being formed, and in any case affords perfect side tightness. The practical construction illustrated in Figures 2 and 2 bis is wholly identical to that shown in Figures 1 and 1 bis respectively, but where in this latter case, each one of panels 1 is provided with two grooves 12 and 13 at the sides, and shaped in the same way as has been explained above for practical constructions described there. Accordingly, this practical construction of the system that is illustrated in Figures 2 and 2 bis requires two load spreader plates 2 to be mounted upon each pair of grooves 13 facing in any one direction. In this practical construction, the screw 3 does not protrude with respect to panels 1 on the opposite side, and a nut 31 may be applied in order to compress one of the four sides plates 2 . Assembly of the joint seal 15 is performed in this case on two pairs of U shapes 14 facing one another symmetrically with respect to the longitudinal axis of each panel 1 . In accordance with the practical construction illustrated inFigures 4 and 4 bis, the two panels 1 to be joined define on one face, a groove 11 set back as a U , but one of whose sides is not parallel to the other, where one portion of the section 1 lying between this groove and the edge of panel 1 is slightly set back with respect to the rest of the panel in this end area, to a height that coincides exactly with the thickness of the joint cover 4 which is included on this face, so that once the joint has been made and this joint cover 4 inserted in the outside plane thereof, it lies flush with the plane of the panel in this end area at the rear, the panel possesses a number of open and or stiffened trapezial insets .The adjacent panel 1 to be joined on possesses the same shape on this face so that the join whereupon is wholly symmetrical with respect to the centre axis defining the panels as they are joined together. On the other face, each panel 1 possesses two successive grooi ves,of which a first groove 12 is identical to that 11 described above, and identical as well to that made in the aforegoing practical constructions, and a second groove 41 in a U section with straight sides and a slight inset 411 having a vee section in the centre of its bottom.The height of the portions lying between the two grooves 12 and 41 , and between each groove 41 and the corresponding end of the panel 1 are such as to lie flush with one another, and be set back from the general outer plane of the panel by such an amount as to coincide exactly with the width taken up by the joint cover 4 embodied in this area, and the load spreader plate 42 which is likewise embodied in this practical construc tion, and engages with the two grooves 41 and the two grooves 12 for which purpose it possesses the required geometrical shape as may be seen in Figures 4 and 6, where the latter show both an elevation as well as a plan view . The join between the panels in this practical construction, once same have been longitudinally positioned with respect to one another, takes place upon inserting the load spreader plate 42 from one side so that the two insets 420 and 421 it possesses become inserted in the respective grooves 41 on the two panels, and the crooked ends 430 and 431 embrace the sloping side of each groove 12 in the direction whereby the two panels are drawn towards one another. Respective screws 3 , which go through plate 42 and each panel 1 in the corresponding area, secure the join. These screws 3 protrude from the opposite side of the panel, and are anchored by insertion into a secure location. The side seal is ensured, as in the case of the practical construction depicted in Figure 1, with two shaped sections 14 and stops 16 , between each of which, a strip 15 of neoprene or aluminium foil or similar is placed. The practical construction of the present invention illustrated in Figures 5 and 5 bis corresponds to the constructions shown in Figures 4 and 4 bis respectively, but with the join on both sides made in such a way that each panel 1 has, on the face opposite to that where successive grooves 12 and 41 are located,two pairs of grooves 12 and 41 in symmetrical correspondence with respect to the longitudinal axis of panels 1 . By inserting a plate 42 , identical to the aforementioned one 42 , into this second face, and by affording screws 3 the possibility of having a nut 31 applied thereto, the continuity between panels 1 is ensured without any need for a stationary structure to secure them. The practical construction shown in Figures 7 and 7 bis. is basically similar to that illustrated in Figures 4 and 4 bis respectively, where each panel 1 has a groove 11 on one side, and on the other, two pairs of grooves 12 and 41 , of which the latter possesses a vee shaped inset 411 in the middle.As with the construction illustrated in Figures 4 and 4 bis, the length on each panel 1 lying between the groove 11 and the edge of the panel is set back with respect to the outermost plane of said panel 1 by an amount which is equal to the thickness of the joint cover 4 , whilst those portions lying between grooves 12 and 41 and between this latter 41 and the edge of the panel are set back with respect to the general plane thereof by an amount that is equal to the sum of the thicknesses of the joint cover 4 and the load spreader plate 72 , so that with this practical construction of the joining system, perfect continuity is ensured on both faces once the join has been accomplished. The load spreader plate 72 possesses in this case a single U section 721 with open sides, whilst its two ends 730 and 731 are set respectively at right angles and obliquely to the body of said plate 72 , and have an inward facing rim. By virtue of this shape, said plate 72 is pressure inserted so that its inset 721 lies inside one of grooves 41 as defined by one of the panels, whilst its shaped ends 730 and 731 embrace respectively the straight side as defined by one of the grooves 41 on the other panel 1 , and the sloping side as defined by the other groove 12 on the panel itself, into whose groove 41 , shape 721 is inserted. The join in this case is completed with a single screw 3 which goes through plate 72 and one of panels 1 and then into a firm structure to secure it. Tightness of the seals between the sides of panels is ensured in this practical construction by two shapes 14 and stops 16 which are identical to those in constructions specified above, and in this case a different kind of seal 15 is used for exactly the same purpose. The practical construction of the joining systems between panels as illustrated in Figures 8 and 8 bis is essentially similar to the constructions shown in Figures 7 and 7 bis, except that in the present case, panels 1 each define a symmetrical shape with a twin pair of grooves 12 and 41 on its two faces. In this case, it is necessary to include a second plate 72 on the other face, having an identical assembly to that described for plate 72 in the practical construction shown in Figures 7 and 7 bis. In this case, screw 3 must be of the kind described in the constructions that are shown in Figures 2 and 5, and therefore capable of taking the nut 31 so that load spreader plates 72 and.72 are pressed together and both panels 1 are also pressed together so as to make a continuous join. The practical construction shown in Figure 10 is essentially similar to that illustrated in Figures 4 and 5, with the following specific connotations This practical construction is applicable for panels having one smooth face and the other covered with spaced trapezial insets.Said panels of this kind 1 possess no specific shape or form upon one of their faces, while one the other they possess successive insets, where insets 12 are identical to those denoted with this number in all the preceding descriptions of constructions, and where insets 41 are identical to those denoted with this number in the constructions shown in Figures 4,5,7 and 8. Joint cover 4 is shaped so as to have sharp edges, or at least sharper edges than those in the preceding constructions. One of these edges abuts at an acute angle with the edge that is set most towards the inside of the straight side of each groove 12 , and it provides a support point at each of its three corners, where said support points are located respectively in the aforementioned area, at the bottom of groove 12 , and at the load spreader plate 100 . This load spreader plate offers its two sloping ends towards the inside in the same way as does plate 42 in the constructions 4 and 5 shown in Figure 6, going on to form a final bend 101 , which also lies upon the edge of each groove 12 , so as in this way to exert pressure over a wider area and provide improved securing. Shaped members 14 and stops 16 in preceding constructions embody a seal of identical material 151 , and between two such seals of this kind, a fill material is inserted for the purpose of ensuring even further the tightness at this area 15 . Screws 3 may have different shaped heads in order to provide greater working space for assembling these panels and this kind of join in accordance with the system being dealt with. The practical construction shown in Figure 11 is substantially the same as the practical construction in Figure 10, except that it comprises panels 1 whose faces are totally flat, so that there is no more than a single outside plane at all points, both on the panel as well as the join. Finally it must be stated that as is obvious, the constructions shown in Figures 10 and 11 may be assembled in a totally symmetrical fashion as are those in Figures 2, 5 and 8, it also being necessary to note that all the practical constructions of this invention are shown purely by way of examples, and may be altered in any detailed or accessory manner as might be thought fit, without altering at all the essential features of the panel joining system covered by this invention. The aforegoing detailed descriptive specification explains a number of practical constructions, all of which are made in accordance with the joining system which is the purpose of this invention. Reference is made in said descriptive specification to the attached drawings where said practical constructions are illustrated, and these are in no way limitative and may therefore be subjected to those minor alterations which do not alter, depart from or modify the essential features, or remove the purpose herefrom.
