# A SOLID FUEL FIRED INVERTED FLAME BOILER FOR CENTRAL HEATING SYSTEMS AND FOR HOT WATER SYSTEMS GENERALLY

## Abstract
The boiler disclosed consists principally in an en closure 1 containing solid fuel 2 , which is encompassed by a baffle structure composed of vertical L section mem bers 5, 6 creating passages 6 that rise toward a chamber 12 where the flue gases are gathered. The surrounding water jacket 8 receives heat from the gases as well as from the inner wall 5 of the baffle, in which transfer occurs by way of the radially disposed members 6 of the L sections. At the lower end 19 of the enclosure 1 one has a grate 22 incorporating fire bars 23 and making contact with sub horizontal longitudinal hollow members 26 in which water circulates. Draughts are set up by a front mounted blower unit 35 from which primary air is sent upward through a port 39 and secondary air is forced in the opp osite direction, through a valve controlled outlet 40, 41 , into the combustion chamber 24 .
