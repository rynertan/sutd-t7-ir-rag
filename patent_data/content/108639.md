# IMPROVED APPARATUS FOR LIQUID COLOUR DEPOSITION

## Abstract
An apparatus for depositing predetemined volumes of liquid colour onto a substrate including at least one dispens ing pump 11 connected between a respective container for liquid colour to be deposited and a respective deposition orifice, characterised in that the pump is actuator by means of a remove actuator 24. The remove actuator comprises a piston rod 29 which moves, under the influence of pneumatic pressure, against a pivoted actuator arm 32. The end of the arm remote from the actuator 24 acts against a collar 23 on a combined piston rod and outlet tube 22 of the pump 11, causing liquid colour to be discharged from the pump. The volume swept by the piston of the pump may be varied by varying the position of the actuator piston rod 29 with respect to the actuator arm 32. Liquid colour may be supplied to the dispensing pumps from a flexible container provided with an external agitator and an outlet spout.
