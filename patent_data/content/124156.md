# Composite dial needle for a single cylinder circular hosiery knitting machine for producing ribbed knitting.

## Abstract
For a single cylinder circular hosiery knitting machine for producing ribbed knitting, there is proposed a composite dial needle comprising an actual needle 10 with a drive butt and provided with a cavity formed in one side of its shank, and a flexible element in the form of a separate jack 20 which lies alongside that side of the needle in which the cavity is formed. The flexible jack element 20 comprises a distal arch opposite the needle cavity to form an eye with the cavity, and has its own drive butt which corresponds to the needle butt.
