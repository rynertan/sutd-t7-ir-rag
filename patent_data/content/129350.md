# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DETECTING FIRING OF PERFORATING GUN

## Abstract
The present invention provides a method and apparatus for detecting complete firing of a perforating gun 24 , particu larly a perforating gun suspended on a string of tubing 14 . The apparatus includes a time delay device 40 coupled to the lower end of the perforating gun 24 and arranged for ignition by an ignition train within the perforating gun. Complete firing of the perforating gun ignites the time delay device, which produces a distinctive signal. The distinctive signal is detected at the surface by at least one transducer 40 , which is coupled to a recorder assembly 48 . The recorder assembly provides an indication as to whether the perforating gun fired as intended.
