# Internal combustion engine with disc inlet valve.

## Abstract
A high performance two stroke internal combustion engine comprises at least one disc inlet valve 27 driven from a shaft 30 via bevel gears 29 . The shaft 30 is driven from a pinion 31 secured to the engine crank shaft 21 via a variable drive 32 . The variable drive includes a spring 39 which biases a cross pin 35 to one end of a spiral slot 36 in the shaft 30 to maintain pinion 38 at a position relative to shaft 30 which provides maximum inlet valve advance during starting. As engine revs increase the pinion 38 progressively leads the shaft 30 thereby retarding inlet valve timing. When the valve timing is fully retarded a bobbin 34 of the drive 32 is latched by a magnet 41 to hold the valve timing fully retarded until engine revs fall.
