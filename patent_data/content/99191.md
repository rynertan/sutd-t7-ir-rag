# TEMPERATURE STABLE INTERVAL TIMER

## Abstract
A temperature compensated crystal oscillator has a permanent interval drift characteristic within a given temper ature range. Output pulses from the oscillator are fed to a pulse swallower controlled by a PROM. The PROM is programmed with the interval drift characteristic information of the oscillator and is addressed by an A D converter receiving input information from a thermistor. The thermis tor provides analog signals representing the temperature of the oscillator. These signals are converted to digital informa tion and address the PROM. The output of the PROM controls the pulse swallower to add or subtract pulses from the oscillator thereby increasing the stability of the oscillator or a given temperature range. Also disclosed is an apparatus for programming the PROM to include the drift correction information.
