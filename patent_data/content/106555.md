# SCRAPING DEVICE FOR A SCRAPING MACHINE

## Abstract
A scraping device for a rotating machine for the scraping of carcass surfaces comprising one or more arms 20 , the free end of which is provided with a scraping edge, and the opposite end of which is hinged to the machine. Around the pivot 24 of the hinge there is a spring 26 , which is placed in such a way and which is provided with such a pre tension, that one end of the spring acts on the arm, urging it towards an initial scraping position. The other end of the spring is firmly attached to the machine. On the latter there is a stop 25 against which the arm rests in its initial scraping position. In the scraping device the spring may be so dimensioned that it has a long working life and at the same time provides a constant contact pressure against the carcass within pre determined limits.
