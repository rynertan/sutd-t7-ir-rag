# Method and apparatus for calibrating a positioning system.

## Abstract
The apparatus includes control means 209 sending command signals to the positioning apparatus 204 . It is intended during a working state to locate an object 203 in relation to an operating area 509 , the situation of the apparatus being sensed 308, 205 and converted to an actual value signal which is sent to the control means. The positioning apparatus has a working state which is inter rupted at given intervals by a calibrating state, during which the positioning apparatus is accurately put in register with at least one detector 208 , situated within the operating area in a given position. The output signals from the detectors are allowed to activate the control means, whereafter the actual value signal is determined and the positioning apparatus calibrated in response to the determined actual value signal.
