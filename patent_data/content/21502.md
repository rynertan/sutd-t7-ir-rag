# Colour display tube.

## Abstract
Colour display tube comprising in an evacuated envelope means to generate a number of electron beams 3,4,5 , a display screen 6 comprising a large number of areas 16 luminescing in different colours, and colour selection means 7 which assign each electron beam 3,4,5 to luminescent areas 16 of one colour, which colour selection means 7 comprise a metal plate 11 which is provided with rows of apertures 9 and which forms a first set of electrodes against which, between said rows, spherical or rod shaped carriers 13 of insulating material are fixed by means of an adhesive, to which carriers 13 elongate conductors 14 are connected which form a second system of electrodes between which systems a potential difference is applied in which grooves 12,15 are present both in the metal plate 11 between the rows of apertures 9 and in the elongate conductors 14 in the longitudinal direction of said conductors 24 , in which grooves 12,15 the carriers 13 are centred unambiguously and are secured in that there are per carrier 13 only two points or lines of contact 17,18,19,20 in each groove 12,15 and in that the carriers 13 are secured to the system 14 having the lower potential by means of an electrically conductive adhesive 21 in the grooves 15 , and substantially no flash overs occur between the systems of electrodes.
