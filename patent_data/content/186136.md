# AUTOCONVERGENCE OF A CATHODE RAY TUBE USING A SEMICONDUCTOR DETECTOR

## Abstract
A CRT calibration system is provided having a CRT with a display screen, an electron gun system, and a plurality of feedback elements. Each feedback element has an active area disposed proximately to the display screen at a preselected location such that an electron beam from the electron gun system can strike at least a portion of the active area. In response to being struck by electrons, each feedback element provides a feedback signal related to the area of the portion struck. The system also includes a detector system for detecting each feedback signal, and an integrating analog to analog converter which, in response, provides a digital signal related to the portion of the active area struck and thereby to the position of the electron beam relative to the particular feedback element interrogated. Also included is a control system for directing the electron beam to strike a sequence of portions of the active area for each feedback element, thereby evoking a corresponding sequence of feedback signals for each feedback element and a corres ponding sequence of digital signals, enabling the control system to determine the location of each feedback element.
