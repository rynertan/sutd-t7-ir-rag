# SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORIES

## Abstract
The NOR decoders of a static random access memory are divided into two or more sets only one of which is powered up at any one time. This significantly reduces the power dissipation of the memory and allows the device to be optional under high access speed conditions. In a preferred arrangement each decoding node is clamped to a voltage level significantly lower than the circuit supply voltage. This provides an increase in operating speed by reducing the deselection time.
