# Anisotropic electric conductive rubber connector.

## Abstract
An anisotropic electric conductive rubber is formed reversed L shape consisting of integral horizontal and vertic al portions. An insulating rubber is applied to the top of the horizontal portion or to the top of the horizontal portion and the outer side of the vertical portion so that a mounting angle is electrically insulated from the electric conductive rubber and that the anisotropic electric conductive rubber is pro tected from moisture and dust. Moreover, the insulating rubber is softer than the anisotropic electric conductive rubber. As a result, the connector as a whole is relatively soft so that it is hardly damaged and that precise dimension is easily obtained.
