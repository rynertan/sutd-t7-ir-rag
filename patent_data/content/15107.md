## Description
Refuse carrying vehicle The invention relates to a vehicle for carrying refuse to a tipping site or dump in the form of bales. Baled refuse is invariably extremely foul smelling and dirty. In addition, the bales are usually held together in a very tenuous manner, that is to say with very little cohesion between the substances of which they are composed, so that it is necessary for the vehicle which is to carry them to be totally enclosed when travelling on the road. A conflicting requirement is that the bales must be able to be quickly and easily unloaded from the vehicle at the tip or dump where they are to be stacked for consolidation of the rubbish. The invention as claimed is intended to provide ab remedy and seeks to solve the problem of how to transport baled refuse quickly and safely to a tipping site or dump, that is to say by the provision of a load carrying vehicle which will be very stable when loaded and also when travelling empty. The advantages offered by the invention are mainly that by virtue of a drop down side wall being devoid of upstanding posts or pillars intermediate the ends of the body the bales of refuse can very easily be removed by fork lift trucks. A further advantage offered by the invention resides In the fact that the design of the roof structure affords the greatest possible safeguards against loose items of refuse blowing away and allows unimpeded removal of the bales of refuse at the tipping site or dump whilst offering the smallest possible area against which side winds can act when in its raised position. Yet a further advantage offered by the invention is that a safety device associated with the roof structure ensures that the vehicle can be operated with safety, for example in windy or gusty conditions. One way of carrying out the invention is described in detail below with reference to the drawings in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view on one side of a loadcarrying vehicle embodying the invention Fig. 2 is a schematic rear view thereof Fig. 3 is a perspective view on the other side of the vehicle Fig. 4 is a perspective view, drawn to a somewhat larger scale than Figs. 1 to 3, which illustrates one of a plurality of securing devices for a plurality of dropdown doors with which the vehicle is provided Fig. 5 is a sectional view on the line 5 5 in Fig.4 Fig. 6 is a view similar to Fig. 4 showing the securing device in a released condition and Fig. 7 is a detail view which illustrates a safety device which will presently be described. Referring now to Figs. 1 to 3 of the drawings, the load carrying vehicle there illustrated is a semi trailer type vehicle having a body generally indicated 10. The body 10 has a flat floor 12, a fixed longitudinal side wall 14 and an oppositely disposed drop down longitudinal side wall 16, the latter being of a somewhat lesser height than the side wall 14 and being constituted by a plurality of drop down doors 13. The body is also provided with a pair of openable rtar doors 15 hingedly connected, respectively, to the rearward portion of the fixed longitudinal side wall and to an upstanding post 17 on the opposite side. A roof structure, generally indicated 18, is pivotally movable, by power operated means generally indicated 20, about the axis of a shaft 22 which extends, as shown, longitudinally of the vehicle at a height just below that of the floor 12. The roof structure includes a panelled portion 24 which, when the roof structure is closed to closely overlie the body, is disposed immediately above and engageable with the drop down side wall. The roof structure also includes an area of flexible synthetic plastics sheeting 25 extending between said panelled portion and the upper edge of the fixed longitudinal side wall 14. The roof structure is carried by a pair of cranked arms 28 each of which is connected at one end to the shaft 22 and at its other end to the panelled portion 24.As shown, the cranked arms are disposed at spaced locations between the ends of the body, and the fixed side wall of the body is provided with pockets 30 for the reception of the upstanding portions of the arms when the roof structure has been moved to the closed position closely overlying the body. The power operated means 20 for pivotally moving the roof structure between its closed and open positions includes a hydraulic ram 32, and an electric motor not shown drivably connected to a hydraulic pump not shown for powering the ram. The hydraulic ram is connected to a lever which is fast with the shaft 22 at a point substantially midway between the arms 28 Referring now in particular to Figs 3 to 6, it will be seen that when the drop down doors 13 are in their dropped position, as shown in chain dotted lines in Fig.3, the entire side of the vehicle is open, that is to say, access is not impeded by the presence of upstanding posts or pillars intermediate the ends of the body. In other words, the side of the vehicle is devoid of upstanding posts or pillars to which the doors might have been connected when in their raised condition. As illustrated in Figs 4 to 6, the drop down doors are pivotally connected to the vehicle body by depending arms 34 constituted by downwardly projecting portions of angle sections which form side members of the doors.Pivot pins 36, by which the doors are pivotally connected to the vehicle body, are horizontally disposed and extend longitudinally of the vehicle a short distance below the floor level of the loading space to which the doors give access. The doors are secured in their raised, operative positions by securing devices each of which includes a latch element 38 pivotally connected to the body of the vehicle about the pivot pin 36 by means of which the pair of doors concerned is connected to the body However, as shown in Fig. 5, an aperture 40 in the latch element through which the pivot pin extends is an elongate aperture so that when the doors are closed, as shown inFig. 4, the latch element can be moved up and down to a limited extent determined by the length of said elongate aperture. The purpose of this is so that a keyhole shaped aperture 42 in the latch element can be engaged with a mushroom shaped head 44 of a pin generally indicated 46 which projects laterally from the body of the vehicle at floor level.A resilient pad 41 is located, as shown, at one end of the elongate aperture in the latch element for a purpose which will presently be explained. The arrangement is such that when the pair of doors concerned have been closed, the latch element can be pivoted upwards to partially overlie a marginal edge part of each door and to bring the mushroom shaped head of the projecting pin through the wider part of the keyhole shaped aperture in the latch element, the latter then being allowed to fall vertically through a limited distance to bring a narrower part of the keyhole shaped aperture in the latch element into engagement with a stem portion of the projecting pin 46. In this way the dropdown doors concerned are retained in their closed position until the latch elements are raised to enable them to be detached from the projecting pins. When the latch element is raised to enable it to be detached from the projecting pin 46, the distance through which it must be displaced is such that the resilient pad 41 is compressed. Consequently, the pad acts as a safety device to prevent the accidental disconnection of the latch element, for example in circumstances where dynamic shocks are brought about as the vehicle is being driven over uneven surfaces. Referring now to Fig. 7, this illustrates the provision of a safety device which is associated with one of the cranked arms 28 so that when the roof structure has been fully raised, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, a strong or gusting wind cannot either take it beyond that fully raised condition or blow it shut by overloading the power operated means 20. The safety device is constituted by a link member 48 pivotally connected near one end to the cranked arm 28 by which it is carried by means of a pivot pin 50.At its other end the link member carries a laterally projecting detent peg 52 which is arranged to engage an upstanding hooked portion 54 of an abutment member generally indicated 56 which is welded to the fixed side wall 14 of the vehicle, The arrangement is such that when the roof structure has been closed and the arms 28 lie close to the side wall 14 of the vehicle the end of the link member which carries the laterally projecting detent peg rests against the side wall. Consequently, when the roof structure is raised, and the arms 28 gradually move away from the side wall 14, the link member slides down the side wall until it reaches a horizontal position from where it is able to fall freely, over centre, into its operative position in which it is shown in full lines in Fig. 7.In this position it will be seen that the link member can act either as a strut, that is to say by moving into abutment with the side wall 14 of the vehicle, to resist any tendency for the roof structure to be blown shut, or can act in tension when the laterally projecting detent peg 52 contacts the upstanding hooked portion 54 of the abutment member 56 to resist any tendency for the roof structure to be blown beyond its fully raised condition. Means are provided for rendering the safety device inoperative when it is again desired to close the roof structure, these means being constituted by a pneumatic or hydraulic ram 58 the piston rod end 60 of which can be extended, as shown in chain dotted lines, to act against a heel portion 62 of the link member 48. A control lever not shown for operating the pneumatic or hydraulic ram is mounted on the front of the loadcarrying body adjacent to othe r control mechanism not shown for operating the ram 32. The arrangement is such that the baled refuse can be loaded into the body through its opened rear end. The vehicle can then be driven to the tipping s ite or dump with the baled refuse totally enclosed so that even in windy conditions no pieces of refuse becoming free from the bales can blow away. At the tipping site or dump, the roof structure can be very quickly and easily moved to its open position by the power operated means, the side wall 15 can be dropped down, and fork lift trucks can be used to remove the bales of refuse through the open side of the vehicle and to stack them where the rubbish is to be consolidated. A relatively fast operating cycle can be maintained when using such a vehicle.It will be understood that the fact that the roof structure can be lifted completely away from the load carrying body and the fact that the body is devoid of posts or pillars intermediate its ends for the securement of the drop down doors in their closed positions greatly facilitates the unloading of the bales by fork lift trucks and avoids rupture of the bales by contact with the roof or other structure during the initial lifting of the bales.It will also be understood that the pivotting of the roof structure about the axis of the shaft 22 and the fact that the latter is located at or in the region of the height of the floor of the body, results in only a part of the width of the roof structure projecting above the height of the fixed side wall when in the open position so that it offers a minimum of additional area against which high side winds can act, The vehicle has a low centre of gravity due to its low overall height and to the lightweight construction of the roof structure. In addition, the vehicle is of relatively light weight when empty.The fact that one longitudinal side wall of the body is fixed and is of full body height results in a strong construction for carrying the bales of refuse which are relatively heavy, that is to say several times heavier than a comparable volume of refuse which has not been compacted and baled. The drop down side wall and the means for securing it in the raised position are sufficiently strong to prevent the bales from falling sideways from the vehicle when the vehicle is being driven Various modification s may be made without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, it will be understood that the vehicle need not necessarily be a semi trailer type vehicle but that it could be a trucktype vehicle. It will also be understood that the poweroperated means for pivotally moving the roof structure between its closed and open positions may be differently constructed. For example, the ram for lifting and lowering the roof structure could be a pneumatic ram instead of a hydraulic ram. Furthermore instead of having an electric motor for driving a separate hydraulic or pneumatic pump, the vehicle could be adapted so that it could be directly coupled to a hydraulic or pneumatic system of a towing vehicle.
