# Concrete structural member and method for manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
A concrete structural member of improved stability is pro duced by preparing a concrete composite layer 5 having a con crete layer 2 on one side and an aggregate layer 4 on the other side thereof, impregnating the composite layer 5 with a mono mer, thermal catalytic treatment the monomer impregnated composite layer 5 thereby polymerizing the monomer embed ded in the composite layer 5, and thereafter placing fresh con crete 7 on the aggregate layer 4 side of the polymer impreg nated composite layer 6.
