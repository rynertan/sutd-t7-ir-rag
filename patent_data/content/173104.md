## Description
This invention relates to a power source system for use in supplying a load with electric power from a plurality of power sources. As will later be described with reference to several figures of the accompanying drawing, such a conventional power source system comprises a plurality of power sources which are connected either in series or parallel to one another. A load is connected to the power source system through a transmission path, such as a coaxial cable, an optical fiber, or the like and is supplied with a load voltage and a load current from the power source system. The load becomes active when the load voltage and the load current exceed a minimum voltage and a minimum current, respectively. Such a minimum voltage or current will be called a minimum level. In a series connection of the power sources, the load voltage is substantially equal to a sum of source voltages produced by the respective power sources while the load current is substantially equal to a source current produced by each power source. From this fact, it is understood that the power sources share the load at rates of load sharing determined by the source voltages of the respective power sources. In a parallel connection of the power sources, the load current is substantially equal to a sum of source currents produced by the respective power sources while the load voltage is substantially equal to a source voltage produced by each power source. In this event, the source currents serve to determine the rates. In both of the series and the parallel connections of the power sources, it will be noted that selected ones of electric components for determining the rates are called first electric components while the other electric components are called second electric components. At any rate, the second electric components are gradually reduced when the rates become heavy as a result of an increase of the first electric components. This means that each power circuit has a positive resistance characteristic. It is assumed that one of the power sources interrupts its source voltage and current due to occurrence of a fault and that the rate of the one power source is reduced to zero. The remaining power source should be operated at a maximum rate and must keep either the load current or the load voltage greater than the minimum current or voltage, even on occurrence of the fault in the one power source. Stated otherwise, the second electric components must be kept at a level greater than the minimum level. Inasmuch as each power source has a positive resistance characteristic in the manner pointed out hereinabove, the second electric components are reduced to the minimum level when the remaining power source is operated at the maximum rate. In addition, the load must favorably be put into operation even when the second electric components have the minimum level. This means that the minimum level of the second electric components should be higher than the minimum current or the minimum voltage. An extra or superfluous electric power should therefore be supplied from the remaining power source to the load in consideration of a fault of the above mentioned one power source. The superfluous electric power excessively heats the load and requires the load to include a radiator of a big size. This makes the load large in size and expensive. It is an object of this invention to provide a power source system which can avoid supply of an extra electric power. It is another object of this invention to provide a power source system of the type described, which serves to make a load small in size and inexpensive. In accordance with the invention the above objects are solved by a power source system as defined in claim 1 or 2. Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, a conventional power source system will be described for a better understanding of this invention. The power source system is for use in supplying a load 20 with a load voltage V In Fig. 1, the power source system comprises a first power source 21 and a second power source 22 connected to the first power source 21 in series. The first power source 21 comprises a first current source 24a, a first resistor 26a of a resistance R₁ connected in parallel to the first current source 24a, and a first diode 27a connected in parallel to the first current source 24a. The first resistor 26a is for making the first power source 21 share the load 20 while the first diode 27a serves to form a bypass circuit when the first current source 24a becomes inactive due to occurrence of a fault, as will become clear as the description proceeds. When the first current source 24a becomes active during a normal operation, a first d.c. current I Likewise, the second power source 22 comprises a second current source 24b, a second resistor 26b, and a second diode 27b. The second resistor 26b has the same resistance R₁ as the first resistor 26a. A second d.c. current I Inasmuch as the first power source 21 is connected to the second power source 22 in series, the load voltage V From this fact, it is readily understood that the load 20 is shared by the first and the second power sources 21 and 22 at rates of load sharing determined by the first and the second source voltages V The load current I In Fig. 2, the abscissa and the ordinate represent the first source voltage V On the other hand, Equation 2 can be made to correspond to a second characteristic 32 in which the load current I Each of the first and the second characteristics 31 and 32 may be named a positive resistance characteristic. The first charactristic 31 intersects the second characteristic 32 at a cross point 33. When the first and the second power sources 21 and 22 simultaneously run or operate and produce the first and the second d.c. currents I Under the circumstances, the first and the second power sources 21 and 22 equally share the load 20. Now, it is assumed that the second power source 22 interrupts operation thereof and that only the first power source 21 bears the load 20 with the second diode 27b conductive. In the illustrated power source system, the load 20 should favorably be operated even when the second power source 22 becomes inactive. Accordingly, the first minimum current I Similarly, the second minimum current I Thus, each of the first and the second d.c. currents I It is possible to reduce the current increment by increasing the resistance R₁ of each of the first and the second resistors 26a and 26b. However, an increase of each resistance R₁ gives rise to a wide variation of each of the first and the second source voltages V Accordingly, a reduction of the normal load current I Referring to Figs. 3 and 4, another conventional power source system comprises first and second power sources which are indicated at 41 and 42 and which are connected together in parallel. The power source system illustrated in Fig. 3 has a duality relation to that illustrated in Fig. 1 and is for use in supplying a load depicted at 20 with a load current I The first power source 41 comprises a first voltage source 43a, a first series diode 44a, and a first series resistor 45a, which are all connected in series. The first voltage source 43a produces a first d.c. voltage E Likewise, the second power source 42 comprises a second voltage source 43b for producing a second d.c. voltage E Anyway, the first and the second power sources 41 and 42 produce first and second source currents i As readily understood from Fig. 3, the load voltage V First and second operation characteristics 46 and 47 are graphical representations of Equations 4 and 5 , respectively. As shown by the first operation characteristic 46, the load voltage V When the first and the second power sources 41 and 42 are simultaneously operated with the first and the second d.c. voltages E Let the second power source 42 be interrupted for some reason. In this event, the second diode 44b is interrupted and the first power source 41 alone bears the load 20 by supplying the load current I Thus, the illustrated power source system has a disadvantage similar to that illustrated in Fig. 1. Referring now to Fig. 5, a power source system according to a first embodiment of this invention comprises first and second power sources 51 and 52 which are connected together in series in a manner similar to the first and the second power sources 21 and 22 Fig. 1 and which supply a load 20 with a load voltage V The first power source 51 produces a first source voltage V More particularly, the first power source 51 comprises a first current source, a first diode, and a first resistor which are indicated at 54a, 55a, and 56a, respectively, and which are similar to those illustrated in Fig. 1. The first current source 54a is for producing a first d.c. current I In the example being illustrated, the first and the second shared voltage are substantially equal to the first and the second source voltages V The first and the second power sources 51 and 52 further comprise first and second current detectors 60a and 60b responsive to the first and the second d.c. currents I Referring to Fig. 6 afresh in addition to Fig. 5, the first current detector 60a comprises a magnetic amplifier composed of a saturable reactor. The saturable reactor comprises a first winding 61 connected to the first diode 55a and a second winding 62 having a terminal connected in common to the primary winding 61 and the other terminal connected to the first resistor 56a. The first and the second windings 61 and 62 have first and second numbers N₁ and N₂ of turns, respectively. It is presumed that the second number N₂ of turns is greater than the first number N₁ of turns. The first d.c. current I Moreover, the first current detector 60a produces a control signal specified by a control voltage V The control voltage V Let the proportional constants g₁ through g₃ be determined with reference to Figs. 5 and 6. It is assumed that the first source voltage V Taking the above into consideration, the predetermined reference voltage V In Fig. 6, the control voltage V The second power source 52 is similar in structure and operation to the first power source 51 and will therefore not be described any longer. As regards the second power source 52, a relationship similar to Equation 9 holds and is given by Referring to Fig. 7, wherein the abscissa and the ordinate represent the first source voltage V As to the second specific characteristic 67, the load current I Reviewing Figs. 5 through 7, it is readily understood that a combination of each current detector 60 and each resistor 56 suffixes omitted is equivalent to a negative resistance and may therefore be replaced by the negative resistance. The combination of each current detector 60 and each resistor 56 may be named a control circuit 70 for controlling each of the first and the second d.c. currents I Each of the first and the second negative resistance characteristics is practically variable within a controllable range, like each of the first and the second characteristics 31 and 32 illustrated in Fig. 2. In Fig. 7, first and second lower limit characteristics 66 and 67 are illustrated under the first and the second negative resistance characteristics 66 and 67 in consideration of practical variations thereof, respectively. Anyway, each of the first and the second source voltages V In the power source system illustrated in Fig. 5, let the minimum load current I Similar operation is carried out when the second power source 52 singly bears the load 20 as a result of interruption of the first power source. In the interim, it is to be noted here that the load current I From this fact, it is understood that the difference between the normal load current I On the other hand, the load current I Accordingly, the load 20 may comprise a small size of a radiator which is included therein for radiation of heat generated by the load 20. The load 20 can thus be reduced in size and becomes economical. Referring to Fig. 8, another connection of the first current detector 60a comprises a first winding 61 supplied with the first d.c. current I It is assumed that the first and the second windings 61 and 62 have first and second numbers N₁ and N₂ of turns, respectively, like in Fig. 6. In this event, the control voltage V In the manner well known in the art, it is possible to render the factor G into a negative value by selecting the first and the second numbers N₁ and N₂ of turns. Specifically, the second number N₂ of turns may be greater than the first number N₁ of turns. Although the first and the second negative resistance characteristics 66 and 67 are obtained by determining the proportional constants g₁ through g₃ in the above mentioned manner, similar characteristics are achieved in the following manner. In Fig. 6, the first current detector 60a detects only the resistor current I The load current In Equation 14 , the first negative resistance characteristic 66 Fig. 7 is obtained when the proportional constant k₁ is greater than 1. This similarly applies to the second power source 60b. Description will therefore be omitted as regards the second power source 60b. Referring now to Fig. 9, a power source system according to a second embodiment of this invention comprises first and second power sources which are depicted at 71 and 72 and which are connected together in parallel like in Fig. 3. The first power source 71 comprises a first voltage source 73a, a first series diode 74a, and a first series resistor 75a, which are operable in a manner similar to those illustrated in Fig. 3. The illustrated first power source 71 further comprises a first current detection circuit 76a which will be described later. Likewise, the second power source 72 comprises a second voltage source 73b, a second series diode 74b, a second series resistor 75b, and a second current detection circuit 76b, which are operable in a manner similar to those of the first power source 71, respectively. Accordingly, description will mainly be directed to the first power source 71. The first power source 71 produces a first source current i In addition, a negative resistance may be substituted for a combination of the first current detection circuit 76a and the first series resistor 75a, like in Fig. 5. The combination of the first current detection circuit 76a and the first series resistor 75a serves to control the first d.c. voltage E Referring to Fig. 10 together with Fig. 9, the first current detection circuit 76a is composed of a magnetic amplifier comprising a saturable reactor. The illustrated saturable reactor comprises a d.c. winding 80 of a number N of turns. The d.c. winding 80 is placed between the first series diode 74a and the first series resistor 75a and allows the first source current i The first voltage source 73a is controlled in accordance with the control voltage V As a result of the above mentioned voltage control, the load voltage V If the proportional constant k₄ is greater than the resistance R₂₀, namely, Similar voltage control is carried out in the second power source 72. In this event, the load voltage V Referring to Fig. 11, the first negative resistance characteristic is shown at 81. It is noted as regards the first negative resistance characteristic that the load voltage V In Fig. 11, the second negative resistance characteristic is also shown at 82 and rises to the left. This means that the load voltage V When the power source system carries out a normal operation, each of the first and the second power sources 71 and 72 shares the load 20 by producing each of the first and the second source currents i It is assumed that the load 20 has a minimum voltage V For example, let the second voltage source 73b be interrupted in the power source system. The first voltage source 73a solely bears the load 20 by producing the first source current i Similar operation is made in the case where the first voltage source 74a is interrupted. With this structure, the normal load voltage V As mentioned before, a time of interruption of either one of the first and the second voltage sources 73a and 73b is extremely shorter than a time of the normal operation. Accordingly, the increase of the load voltage V Referring to Fig. 5 again and Figs. 12 and 13, a power source system according to a third embodiment of this invention comprises a power source depicted at 85 in Fig. 13 substituted for each of the first and the second power sources 51 and 52 illustrated in Fig. 5. The power source 85 has first and second characteristic curves 86 and 87 Fig. 12 when used as the first and the second power sources 51 and 52 Fig. 5 , respectively. In Fig. 12, it is noted that each of the first and the second characteristic curves 86 and 87 partially shows a negative resistance characteristic like in Fig. 7 and is nonlinearly varied with an increase of each of the first and the second source voltages V Likewise, the second characteristic curve 87 is variable relative to the second source voltage V When each of the first and the second d.c. currents I Moreover, an increase of the load current I In order to accomplish the first and the second characteristics 86 and 87, the power source 85 is assumed to be used as the first power source 51 and comprises a current detector 60 illustrated in Fig. 13. Any other elements and signals are similar to those illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6 and are therefore represented by the same reference numerals and symbols. In Fig. 13, the first current source 54a is operable in cooperation with the current detector 60 in a manner similar to that illustrated in Fig. 5 and produces the first d.c. current I The current detector 60 comprises a magnetic amplifier depicted at 91. The illustrated magnetic amplifier 91 comprises a d.c. winding 92 and produces a detection signal having a detection voltage V The detection voltage V When the limiter 94 is used in the current detector 60 , the proportional constant g₄ is equal to zero. As a result, the control voltage V Herein, a relationship between the detection voltage V A reduction of a voltage is extremely small in the current detector 60 and can be neglected. Under the circumstances, it is readily understood from Fig. 13 that the resistor current I Similarly, Equation 49 is rewritten with reference to Equations 20 through 22 into The first current source 54a is supplied with the control voltage V When the first source voltage V In Equation 27 , the proportional constant g₄ is equal to zero when the limiter 94 is used in the current detector 60 . Equation 27 is simplified into The above mentioned fact applies to the case where the power source 85 illlustrated in Fig. 12 is used as the second power source 52 illustrated in Fig. 5. Anyway, a variation of the load current I Referring to Figs. 14 and 15, a power source system according to a fourth embodiment of this invention is similar to that illustrated in conjunction with Figs. 9 and 11 except that a power source 100 Fig. 14 has a nonlinear characteristic as illustrated in Fig. 15 and is operable as each of the first and the second power sources 71 and 72 Fig. 9 . For simplicity of description, it is presumed that the power source 100 illustrated in Fig. 14 is used as the first power source 71 Fig. 9 . A current detection circuit 76 in the power source 100 is similar to the current detector 60 illustrated in Fig. 13 and comprises a magnetic amplifier and a limiter which are indicated at 101 and 102, respectively, so as to provide a first one of the nonlinear characteristic indicated at 106 in Fig. 15. It is needless to say that a second one of the nonlinear characteristic 107 is given by the second power source 72 Fig. 9 . Anyway, each of the first and the second nonlinear characteristics 106 and 107 has a transistion current I The first d.c. voltage E In Fig. 14, the first source current i The detection voltage V When V Herein, the preselected reference voltage V₀ is determined in consideration of the transition current I Accordingly, when V In Equation 33 , it is possible to select the third term of k₆ g₆ g₇ R₂₀ so that a value of the term becomes equal to a desired value equal to or smaller than zero. Thus, the first nonlinear characteristic 106 can have a positive resistance characteristic when the first source current i Similar operation is also carried out in the second power source 72 Fig. 9 . With this structure, an increase of the load voltage V According to the invention, a voltage detector may be used instead of each current detector illustrated in Figs. 5, 9, 13, and 14. In this case, the voltage detector may monitor a voltage across the resistor, such as 56, 75.
