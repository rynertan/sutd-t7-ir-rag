# Heat pump comprising a thermally driven liquid pump and liquid pump for use in a heat pump.

## Abstract
A heat pump in which there is arranged in a circuit between an absorber 7 and a generator 1 a liquid pump 9 comprising a piston 35 which is displaceable in a cylinder 33 and forms the separation between a gas chamber 37 and a liquid chamber 39 in which simultaneously prevails a pressure of comparatively low level during the suction stroke and a pressure of comparatively high level during the delivery stroke. A guide member 47 secured to the cylinder 33 defines with the piston 35 an auxiliary chamber 51 of variable volume in which liquid at comparatively low pressure at least during the delivery stroke is constantly present. The gas chamber 37 is connected to alternately to low and high gas pressure pipes 69 and 71, respectively in the heat pump, whilst the liquid chamber 39 is connected synchronously therewith alternately to low and high liquid pressure pipes 11a and 11b, respectively in the heat pump. The heat pump provides an attractive solution especially for domestic heating for pumping liquid solution between the generator and the absorber because of the low noise and low energy liquid pump driven by means of pressure differences in the heat pump itself.
