# ENDLESS LOOP TAPE CARTRIDGE

## Abstract
A cartridge including a fixed hub 14 having a central opening 16 and a slot 17 communicating with the opening 16 , and an endless length of magnetic tape 22 having a major portion coiled about the hub 14 and a minor portion extending from the innermost wrap of the coil 26 , through the slot 17 and around the side surface of the coil 26 to the coil s outermost wrap. Means on the housing 12 defining a tape path for the minor tape portion include a spring 72 biased movable guide pin 34 that provides a desired low, predetermined tension in the outermost wrap of the coil 26 , which in turn produces a relatively high, generally uniform tension in tape 22 being pulled from the coil 26 through the slot 17 . A portion 13 of the hub 14 can be moved radially to adjust the length of the minor tape portion, and a lock assembly 15 is provided for restricting movement of tape 22 in the coil 26 during shipping.
