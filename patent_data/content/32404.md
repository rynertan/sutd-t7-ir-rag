# Method and means for removing binder from a green body.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a method of binder removal from a green body before sintering or the like wherein the green body is placed in a pressure chamber wherein the pressure is raised to a level above the vapor pressure of the binder in the green body at the ambient temperature within the pressure chamber. Where several binders are utilized simultaneously, the pressure within the chamber is main tained higher than the vapor pressure of the lowest of the binders then in the green body at the temperature within the green body. Under these conditions, the binder or binders will turn to a vapor, will follow the normal laws of evapora tion and diffusion and diffuse out from the green body into the surrounding environment within the chamber. The bin der can subsequently be removed from the chamber in con ventional manner.
