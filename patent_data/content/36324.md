# TRACTOR VEHICLE SAFETY SYSTEM

## Abstract
A tractor vehicle safety system comprises a logic circuit 8 and a socket 112 mounted on the tractor. The socket 112 includes a set of magnetically operable switches 112a, 112b, 112c and 112d. The socket 112 also includes a winding 114 connected across an oscillator 9. A plug 117 for mounting on a trailer includes an electromagnet 119 connected in series with a winding 120, which together with the winding 114 forms a transformer 115, a normally closed emergency switch 125 connected between the winding 120 and electromagnet 119, and a set of magnets 117a, 117b and 117c for actuating the switches 112a, 112b and 112c. Although all three magnets are shown, in practice only desired magnets would be included which relate to the safety requirements of a machine provided on the trailer and the emergency switch 125 is optional. The logic circuit 8 drives a warning circuit and also a vehicle disabling circuit. In use, with the socket 112 engaged with a plug 117 appropriate for the safety requirements of the trailer machine being used, the switches 112a and 112d are closed as is appropriate for the safety requirements and the warning circuit and vehicle disabling circuit are actuated if the safety requirements of the trailer machine are not met.
