# Photoreceptor for positive electrostatic charge.

## Abstract
A photoreceptor is described comprising a carrier gener ation layer and a carrier transport layer, wherein said carrier generation layer contains a carrier generating substance whose photosensitivity when negatively charged is higher than that when positively charged, a carrier transporting substance and a binder and the thickness of said carrier generation layer is from 1µm to 10µm, and said carrier transport layer contains a carrier transporting substance and a binder and is present on the lower surface of said carrier generation layer.
