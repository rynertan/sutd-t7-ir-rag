## Description
BRIGHT NICKEL PLATING BATH AND PROCESS AND COMPOSITION THEREFOR This invention relates to improved processes and compositions for the electrodeposition of nickel and alloys thereof. It has been found that the presence of zinc impurities tends to produce plating defects during the electrodeposition of nickel electroplates using compositions containing primary and secondary brighteners. The problem is especially acute during plating when the secondary brightener is saccharin o benzoyl sulfimide . In this case inadequate basis metal coverage may occur in low current density areas unsightly striated ribbed deposits may occur and dark, thin non metallic appearing deposits may be produced which not only detract from the final appearance of the article being plated, but may also interfere with the receptivity, appearance, luster, etc. of subsequent deposits such as chromium plate. In order to overcome the deleterious effects of zinc in the presence of saccharin, the use of sulfinic acids or hydroxy sulfonates has been used. While these compounds do reduce the problem, their use also reduces the overall brightness and levelling of the deposit. This results in having to use thicker nickel deposits or higher levels of the primary additives in order to obtain commercially acceptable deposits. An alternative approach has been to replace saccharin with another Class I additive, i.e., sodium benzene sulfonamide, sodium toluene sulfonate. These Class I additives while not as sensitive to zinc impurities as is saccharin, are inferior to saccharin with respect to stress reduction, luster building in cooperation with Class II additives , sulfur contribution specially important in duplex plating . It is an object of this invention to provide processes and compositions for depositing electrodeposits of nickel in the presence of saccharin and zinc impurities. It is also an object of this invention to accomplish this without affecting the brightness or levelling of the deposit. In accordance with certain of its aspects, this invention relates to an improved process and composition for the preparation of nickel or nickel alloy electrodeposits which comprises passing current from an anode to a cathode through an aqueous acidic electroplating solution containing 1 at least one nickel compound 2 saccharin 3 zinc ions the improvement comprising the presence of a sulfonated acetylenic compound or salts thereof, where the acetylenic bond and the sulfonate radical are connected by a carbon chain of at least one carbon atom and not more than 6 carbon atoms.

The term Class I brighteners as used herein, and as described in Modern Electroplating, Third Edition,F. Lowenheim, Editor, is meant to include aromatic sulfonatesr sulfonamides, sulfonimides, etc., as well as aliphatic or aromatic aliphatic olefinically unsaturated sulfonates, sulfonamides, sulfonimides, etc.Specific examples of such plating additives are 1 disodium 1,5 naphthalene disulfonate 2 trisodium 1,3,6 naphthalene trisulfonate 3 sodium benzene monosulfonate 4 dibenzene sulfonimide 5 sodium 3 chloro 2 butene l sulfonate 6 sodium ss styrene sulfonate 7 sodium allyl sulfonate 8 monoallyl sulfamide 9 diallyl sulfamide 10 allyl sulfonamide Such plating additive compounds, which may be used singly or in suitable combinations, are desirably employed in amounts ranging from about 0.5 to 10 grams per liter and provide the advantages described in the above reference and which are well known to those skilled in the art of nickel electroplating. The term Class II brighteners as used herein, and as described in Modern Electroplating, Third Edition,F. Lowenheim, Editor, is meant to include plating additive compounds such as reaction products of epoxides with alphahydroxy acetylenic alcohols such as diethoxylated 2 butyne 1,4 diol, N heterocyclics, dye stuffs, acetylenic amines, etc. Specific examples of such plating additives are 1 1,4 di B hydroxyethoxy 2 butyne 2 1,4 di ss hydroxy y chloropropoxy 2 butyne 3 1,4 di B ,y epoxypropoxy 2 butyne 4 1,4 di B hydroxy y butenoxy 2 butyne 5 l,4 di 2 hydroxy 4 oxa 6 heptenoxy 2 butyne 6 N 2,3 dichloro 2 propenyl pyridinium chloride 7 2,4,6 trimethyl N propargyl pyridinium bromide 8 N allylquinaldinium bromide 9 2 butyne 1,4 diol 10 propargyl alcohol 11 2 methyl 3 butyn 2 ol 12 quinaldyl N propanesulfonic acid betaine 13 butynoxy ethane sulfonic acids 14 propynoxy ethane sulfonic acids 15 quinaldine dimethyl sulfate 16 N allylpyridinium bromide 17 isoquinaldyl N propanesulfonic acid betaine 18 isoquinaldine dimethyl sulfate 19 N allylisoquinaldine bromide 20 1,4 di B sulfoethoxy 2 butyne 21 3 8 hydroxyethoxy propyne 22 3 B hydroxypropoxy propyne 23 3 B sulfoethoxy propyne 24 phenosafranin 25 fuchsin 26 propargyl amine 27 l diethylamino 2 propyne 28 5 dimethylamino 2 methyl 3 pentyn 2 ol 29 l dimethylamino 2 pentyne 30 l dimethylamino 2 butyne When used alone or in combination, desirably in amounts ranging from about 5 to 1000 milligrams per liter, a Class II brightener may produce no visual effect on the electrodeposit, or may produce semi lustrous, fine grained deposits.However, best results are obtained when Class II brighteners are used with one or more Class I brighteners in order to provide optimum deposit luster, rate of brightening, leveling, bright plate current density range, low current density coverage, etc. The term anti pitting or wetting agents as used herein is meant to include a material which functions to prevent or minimize gas pitting. An anti pitting agent, when used alone or in combination, desirably in amounts ranging from about 0.05 to 1 gram per liter, may also function to make the baths more compatible with contaminants, such as oil, grease, etc. by their emulsifying, dispersing, solubilizing, etc. action on such contaminants and thereby promote attaining of sounder deposits. Preferred anti pitting agents may include sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium lauryl ether sulfate and sodium dialkylsulfosuccinates. The nickel compounds employed for electrodepositing nickel are typically added as the sulfate, chloride, sulfamate, or fluoborate salts. The sulfate, chloride, sulfamate and fluoborate salts of nickel are employed in concentrations sufficient to provide nickel in the electroplating solutions of this invention in concentrations ranging from about 10 to 150 grams per liter. The nickel electroplating baths of this invention additionally may contain from about 30 to 60 grams per liter, preferably about 45 grams per liter of boric acid or other buffering agents to control the pH e.g. from about 3.0 5.0, preferably 4.0 and to prevent high current density burning. In order to prevent burning of high current density areas, and provide for more even temperature control of the solution, solution agitation may be employed. Air agitation, mechanical stirring, pumping, cathode rod and other means of solution agitation are all satisfactory.Additionally, the solutions may be operated without agitation. The operating temperature of the electroplating baths of this invention may range from about 400C to about 700 C, preferably from about 500C to 620 C. The average cathode current density may range from about 0.5 to 12 amperes per square decimeter, with 3 to 6 amperes per square decimeter providing an optimum range. Typical aqueous nickel containing electroplating solutions which may be used in combination with effective amounts of cooperating additives include the following wherein all concentrations are in grams per liter g l unless otherwise indicated.

All anodes are usually suitably covered with cloth or plastic bags of desired porosity to minimize introduction into the bath of metal particles, anode slime, etc. which may migrate to the cathode either mechanically or electrophoretically to give roughness in cathode deposits. The substrates on which the nickel electrodeposits of this invention may be applied may be metal or metal alloys such as are commonly electrodeposited and used in the art of electroplating such as nickel, cobalt, nickel cobalt, copper, tin, brass, etc. Other typical substrate basis metals from which articles to be plated are manufactured may include ferrous metals such as iron, steel, alloy steels, copper, tin and alloys thereof such as with lead, alloys of copper such as brass, bronze, etc., zinc, particularly in the form of zinc base die castings all of which may bear plates of other metals, such as copper, etc. Basis metal substrates may have a variety of surface finishes depending on the final appearance desired, which in turn depends on such factors as luster, brilliance, leveling, thickness, etc. of the nickel electroplate applied on such substrates. It is in the electroplating of zinc base die castings that the application of this invention is very useful, as die castings fall into the electroplating solution and cause high levels of zinc impurities. These impurities in the presence of saccharin cause the unsightly electrodeposits mentioned previously and can result in high operating costs. The addition or inclusion of specified amounts of a sulfonated acetylenic compound or salts thereof, where the acetylenic bond and the sulfonate radical are connected by a carbon chain where C 1 6, to an aqueous acidic nickel electroplating containing saccharin and zinc impurities, will result in a bright, well leveled deposit free from the previously mentioned defects.
