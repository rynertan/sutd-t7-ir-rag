## Description
This invention relates to a dye canposition and its use in dyeing hair. In the past thirty years, a variety of chemical systems for dyeing hair has been developed. The nost commercially successful system uses phenylenediamine combined with various couplers and modifiers, and hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant. Although this system covers gray hair well, it suffers fran the problems that phenylenediamine is a known sensitiser, that the hair is damaged by repeated exposure to alkaline peroxide, and that the colour produced may fade with time, to an off shade. Further, Crevelli et al, Fd.Cosmet. Toxicol. 19 1981 79 84, disclose that pphenylenediamine is oxidised in the presence of resorcinol by hydrogen peroxide to a mutagen that is percutaneously absorbed. US A 4021538 discloses a method for producing pigmentation in hair and skin the method uses esters of dopa, because of their solubility in both water and lipid solvents. Dopa itself is practically insoluble in water or lipid solvents. Thus, when topically applied, it will penetrate the hair only slightly.US A 4390341 discloses a composition for colouring hair or skin which employs, inter alia, acylated dopamine or acylated tyrosine derivatives and atega amino acids. The need exists for an effective dye composition to change grey hair to a pleasing black, brown or other colour. Such a dye composition desirably should be non nutagenic, non sensitising, do little or no damage to the hair and skin, and impert a desired colour which is stable to repeated washings and weathering. A dye ccmposition according to the present invention comprises 1 a suitable organic compound to assist dye penetration 2 a dye precursor such as dopamine, D dopa, L dopa or D,1 dopa and 3 iodate or periodate. The result of this ccmbination of dyeing elements is manifested by pleasing and stable colours itrted to hair and other keratinous fibres. For example, gray hair is dyed to a pleasing and stable red, brown or black colour. The dyeing agent is non sensitising and nonirmtagenic, In addition, a melanin like dye confers several surprising advantageous properties to the hair. There is minimal or no damage to the hair and no dyeing of the skin. The colour is stable to washing but, after a large number e.g. 20 of washings or after permanent waving, the colour may fade won shade , e.g. to a lighter tone of the same colour, thus avoiding the red or green overtones which are often observed after repeated washing or perming of hair coloured with commercially available phenylenediaminebased dyes. Another unforeseen advantageous property of the novel composition is protection against damage by ultraviolet light by comparison, irradiation of gray hair, natural or dyed with a commercial dye, causes damage. Many compounds are known in the hair dyeing art, which can be used to assist dye penetration. A suitable organic compound for use in the invention is compatible with the dye precursor and does not react with the oxidant. Examples of suitable organic compounds are phenols, including thymol 2 isopropyl 5 methylphenol C5 10 ketones, including acetophenone, 4 ethylacetophenone, cyclohexanone, 4,5 dimethylacetophenone, 3, 5 dimethylcyclobexanone and 4 methylcyclohexanone C5 10 esters, including ethyl benzoate, benzyl acetate, benzyl propionate and benzyl butyrate alcohols, including a Cg 10 carbocyclic alcohols such as cyclohexanol and 2 methylcyclohexanol, b heterocyclic alcohols such as furfuryl alcohol, c C58 8 aliphatic alcohols such as hexanol and 2 methyl 1 pentanol, and d aryl alkanols such as benzyl alcohol, a,a dimethylbenzyl alcohol, a propylbenzyl alcohol, DL a methylbenzyl alcohol, 2 benzyloxyethanol, 2 benzyloxypropanol, 2 benzyloxy butanol, and ethylene glycol phenyl ether lactones, comprising butyrolactone 1,2 propylene glycol carbonate ethylene carbonate tetramethylene sulfone butadiene sulfone tetrahydrp thiophene dioxide l substituted azacycloalkane 2 ones, comprising l n dodecylazacycloheptan 2 one and ethylene glycol sulfite.The suitable organic compound may be present at a concentration of 0.130 , and be a mixture of two or more compatible compounds. The second key element in the dyeing combination of the subject invention is the use of an acceptable dye precursor, for example, dopamine, D dopa, L dopa, D,Ldopa, or suitable analogs thereof, at a concentration of about 1 to about 100 mg ml, preferably about 5 to about 25 mg ml, to the dye composition.The dye precursor, which can be a mixture of two or more compatible compounds, can be shown by the formula EMI3.1 wherein R1, R2 can be the same or different and are H, alkyl 1 4C , NH2, OH, COOR R is alkyl 1 4C or H , CONH2, halogen C1, Br, I, F , OR R is alkyl 1 4C CH2OH, CH2NH2, or CONR R wherein R and R can be the same or different R3 is H or alkyl 1 4C R4, R5 can be the same or different and are H, alkyl l 4C , NH2, OH, COOR , C0NH21 halogen, ORIt, NO21 SO3, NMR , NR tRtt, CH2OH, or CH2NH2. Preferred dye precursors can be shown by the formulaEMI4.1 wherein Rl, R2 can be the same or different and are H, CH3, C2Hs, OR, or halogen R3 is H, CR3, or C2H5 R4, R5, can be the same or different and are as defined previously. The most preferred dye precursor is dopamine, where in the above formula R1 R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 H. Examples of suitable analogs of dopamine, D dopa,L dopa, or D,L dopa are 2 methyldopamine, 5 methyldopamine, or alpha aminomethyl 3,4 dihydroxybenzyl alcohol.A wider variety of hair colors can be obtained, if desired, by use of dopamine, D dopa, L dopa, D,L dopa, or a suitable analog as defined herein, in conjunction with a color modifier. Such a color modifier, at a concentration of about 0.1 to about 10 mg ml of the dye composition, can be, for example, 4 methylcatechol, 3,4dihydroxybenzoic acid, 3,4 dihydroxybenzaldehyde, 4bromocatechol, catechol, 4 methoxycatechol, and the like or substituted phenols or anilines, for example m aminophenol, resorcinol, and the like a thiol such as a cysteine, glutathione or mercaptoacetic acid or an amino acid such as lysine. The color modifier can be a mixture of two or more compatible compounds. The third key element is an iodate or periodate oxidizer at a concentration of about 1 to about 50 mg ml.Though the sodium salt form is preferred, any alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salt of iodate or periodate can be used. If desired, a thickening agent can be incorporated into the dyeing combination to minimize dripping from the hair. Suitable thickeners include water soluble resins and gums, for example, carrageenan, guar gum, locust bean gum, and the like also polymers, such asCarbopol 934 BF Goodrich Chemical Group, Cleveland, OH , polyvinyl alcohol, and the like or inorganic materials, for example, Veegum Vanderbilt Company, Norwalk, CN , nonoxynol 4, nonoxynol 9 Heterene Chemical Co., Paterson, NJ or combinations of nonoxynols, and the like.A particularly useful thickening agent is polyethylene glycol 150 distearate PEG 150 distearate Heterene . For example, a 10X solution of PEG 150 distearate is compati ble with the dyeing reaction and gives a commercially useful thickened product. Thickening agents can be used in a variety of combinations. The thickener can be present at about 0.1 to about 25 by weight, relative to the total weight of the dye composition. Upon contacting gray hair with a dye composition comprising an organic compound to assist dye penetration, dopamine, D dopa, L dopa, D,L dopa, or a suitable analog, and an oxidizing agent, at a pH of 3 to 7 there is obtained hair having a pleasing stable black color. Other colors can be obtained by use of color modifiers and persulfate, as disclosed herein. When a brownish color is desired for the gray hair, then the addition of a persulfate, for example, potassium persulfate at a concentration of about 0.1 to about 20 mg ml, preferably about 1 to about 5 mg ml, to the dye composition, can be added. When an organic compound or color modifier, defined above, is not readily soluble in aqueous solution, it can be solubilized with up to about 50X of an organic solvent, for example, propanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, and the like. These solubilizing solvents are not suitable for use to assist dye penetration. The pH of the dye composition should be from about 3 to about 7.0. Standard buffers and acidifying agents can be used to maintain the pH within this range by procedures well known in the hair dye art. The dyeing process is enhanced at temperatures above room temperature. For example, better dye penetration is realized at 350C than at 200C. Higher tem peratures can be achieved by a variety of methods, including covering the head with a plastic cap during the dyeing reaction warming of the dye precursor and oxidant solutions before application, either with an external device or with an exothermic reaction initiated by mixing of, for example, the precursor and oxidant solutions with an infrared lamp or by other means well known in the hair dyeing art. Anionic, cationic, non ionic or amphoteric watersoluble surface active agents also can be included in the dye composition. Surface active agents that can be used are alkylbenzenesulfonates, alkylnaphthalenesulfonates, sulfates, ether sulfates, and sulfonates of fatty alcohols, quaternary ammonium salts, such as trimethylacetylammonium bromide and cetylpyridinium bromide, diethanolamides of fatty acids, and polyoxyethyleneated or polyglycerolated acids, alcohols or alkylphenols. The surface active agents are preferably present in the dye composition in a proportion of about 0.1 to about 15Z by weight. Advantageously, a stabiiizer can be added to the dye composition if the dopamine dye precursor is in the dissolved state. A suitable stabilizer is the reducing agent sodium metabisulfite at a concentration of 1 to 5 mM. The subject dye composition can be used in various forms, for example, liquid, cream, gel or an aerosol, or in any other form that is suitable for dyeing hair and other keratinous fibers.
