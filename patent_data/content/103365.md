# Refractory brick with expansion allowance.

## Abstract
A refractory brick 10 without a metal casing and hav ing built in expansion at the hot face is formed by having at least one side face divided into two sections, the section ad jacent the cold face being of normal configuration, but the section adjacent the hot face being inclined at a greater an gle to the opposed side face 15 , whereby expansion allow ance is provided at the hot face 12 , the section adjacent the hot face also having at least one raised portion 22 , preferably adjacent the hot face, the height of the raised portion being such that its surface lies substantially in the plane extended of the lower, cold face 11 section. By this construction, a brick is provided with built in expansion al lowance at the hot face, substantial bearing surface at the cold face to prevent loosening of the refractory structure in use, and means to prevent inadvertent closing of the hot face thermal expansion allowance during placement of the brick in a kiln or furnace.
