# Electrolytic production of chlorine and caustic soda.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for producing chlorine and caustic soda in an electrolytic membrane cell 10 which comprises providing a pressure differential between the anode compartment 15 and the cathode compartment 17 sufficient to prevent substantial contact of the mem brane 12 with the anode 14 and reducing fluctuations in the pressure differential by allowing depleted sodium chloride brine and chlorine gas to flow freely from the ano de compartment to a brine collection point 42 . Also, the caustic soda and hydrogen gas produced in the cathode compartment are allowed to flow freely from the cathode compartment to a caustic soda collection point 34 .
