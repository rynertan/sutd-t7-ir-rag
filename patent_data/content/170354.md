# Membrane separation apparatus.

## Abstract
A cylindrical casing 13, contains a bundle of parallel tubular membranes, which may be capillary, their ends secured in a resinous fixant mass 14, 15 at each end of the casing. A first end cap 18 has a lateral inlet nozzle 16 for feed liquid to be treated, an air vent 23 closed in use by a stopper 24, and an outlet nozzle 17 corresponding to an aperture 22 in the casing for outlet of purified permeated liquid, a second cap 20 has an outlet nozzle 19 which allows passage of concentrated non permeated liquid. At least the first fixant mass 14 slopes obliquely so that its inner face 14b is at its highest point level with the top of the permeated liquid outlet 22 and its outer face 14a is at its lowest point below the bottom of the feed inlet 16 the second fixant mass 15 preferably slopes parallely. The angle of slope is 5 to 70 , preferably 15 to 45 . The inlet nozzle 16 and outlet nozzle 17 are on the same axis so that two units can readily be coupled together in series, if desired. The membranes may be enclosed in a protective envelope 12 and the bundle is then offset away from the permeated liquid outlet 22 to allow a lower flow rate at that side.
