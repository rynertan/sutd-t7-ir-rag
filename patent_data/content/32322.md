# Method for obtaining mold spore material.

## Abstract
A method of obtaining mold spore material useful for inhalant allergy comprising growing a mold 19 which includes mold spores 21 and mycelia 23 on a medium 13 which supports growth of the mold. A porous barrier 17 is provided between the medium 13 and at least some of the mold 19 so that a first group of the mold spores 21 and mycelia 23 lies on the side 25 of the barrier 17 remote from the medium 13 and a second group of mycelia 23 lies in the medium 13 and on the other side 27 of the barrier. After optimum growth of the mold has occurred, the barrier and the first group of mold spores and mycelia are removed from the medium and allowed to dry. Subsequently, at least some of the first group of mold spores and mycelia are removed from the barrier and are sieved to separate the mold spores from most of the mycelia.
