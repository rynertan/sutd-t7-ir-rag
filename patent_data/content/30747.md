## Description
2 Equivalent yellow forming colour couplers, their use in the production of photographic colour images,and photographic elements containing such couplers. The present invention relates to novel 2 equivalent yellow forming colour couplers, to the use thereof in the production of photographic colour images, and to photographic elements containing such colour couplers. It is known that for the production of a photographic colour image in a light sensitive silver halide layer, the exposed silver halide is developed to a silver image by means of an aromatic primary amino compound in the presence of a colour coupler, which reacts with the oxidized colour developing agent to form image dye at the areas corresponding to the silver image. In subtractive three colour photography use is generally made of a light sensitive photographic multilayer colour element comprising a red sensitized silver halide emulsion layer, a green sensitized silver halide emulsion layer, and a blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer, in which material upon colour development, by the use of appropriate colour couplers, a cyan, a magenta, and a yellow dyestuff image are formed respectively. Usually, cyan forming colour couplers are phenols or naphthols, magenta forming colour couplers are pyrazolones, and the yellow forming colour couplers are compounds comprising a methylene group that carries two adjacent carbonyl groups. The dyes formed by coupling are azomethines, indamines, or indophenols depending on the composition of the colour coupler and of the developing agent. Many yellow forming colour couplers have an active methylene group, which during colour development enters into reaction with the oxidized colour developing agent. During this coupling reaction four equivalents of developable silver halide are needed, which is the reason why these colour couplers are called 4 equivalent colour couplers. In another group of colour couplers, the so called 2 equivalent couplers, a hydrogen atom of the active methylene group has been replaced by a coupling off substituent, which is split off during the coupling reaction. In that case only two equivalents of developable silver halide are needed for the formation of the dyes. Many coupling off substituents have been described, e.g. heterocyclic nitrogen containing substituents as described in the published German Patent ApplicationsDE OS 2,329,587 filed June 9, 1973 and DE OS 2,559,190 filed December 30, 1975, both by Agfa Gevaert A.G. Yet, many of them do not satisfy entirely the photographic requirements. The above mentioned German Patent ApplicationDE OS 2,329,587 discloses the use of 2 equivalent yellow forming couplers having as coupling off substituent a five inembered unsaturated heterocyclic pyrrole, diazole, triazole, thiazolone 2, or oxazolone 2 nucleus these nuclei may carry substituents e.g. alkoxycarbonyl substituents. Although these couplers can be readily prepared and have favourable photographic characteristics e.g. high coupling activity, their stability in aqueous acid or alkaline medium is not quite satifactory. According to the invention there are provided novel colour couplers of the acylacetanilide type,capable of forming yellow azomethine dyes by reaction with an oxidized aromatic primary amino developing agent, said colour couplers carrying on the methylene group between the two carbonyl groups an 1 ieidazolyl coupling off group, characterized in that said 1 imidazolyl group is a 2 arylcarbamoyl imidazol 1 yl group, a 2 alkylcarbamoyl imidazol 1 yl group, or a 2 aroyl imidazol 1 yl group. More particularly, in accordance with the present invention there are provided novel 2 equivalent yellow forming colour couplers corresponding to the following general formulaEMI3.1 whereinAr represents phenyl or phenyl substituted by 1 to 3 substituents, which may be the same or different and are selected from the group consisting of a branched or unbranched alkyl group having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having 1 to 18 carbon atoms e.g. methoxy and n hexadecyloxy, a halogen atom e.g. chlorine, acylamido or substituted acylamido e.gt di alkyl substituted phenoxyacylamido, carbamoyl or substituted carbamoyl, sulphamoyl or substituted sulpha moyl e.g.N,N dialkyl substituted sulphamoyl, carboxy, nitro, alkylsulphonyl, or arylsulphonyl,R1 represents a branched or unbranched alkyl group having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, wherein in the case of a secon dary or tertiary alkyl group the secondary or tertiary carbon atom is preferably linked directly to the carbo nyl group e.g. a tert butyl group, an alkoxy group having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, an alkoxyalkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, a heterocyclic group, an aryl group, or an aryl group substituted with alkyl, alkoxy e.g. methoxyphenyl and n hexadecyl oxyphenyl, a halogen atom, acyl, acylamido or substituted acylamido, carbamoyl or substituted carbamoyl, sulphamoyl or substituted sulpha moyl, sulphonamido, or carboxy RÚ preferably being tert butyl, phenyl, or substituted phenyl, R2 and R3 are substituents used in colour coupler chemistry, which may be the same or different, these substituents being hydrogen, alkyl e.g. methyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, aryl or substituted aryl, acylamido or substituted acylamido, carbamoyl or substituted carbamoyl, sulphamoyl or substituted sulphamoyl, sulphoamino, alkoxyearbonyl e.g. ethoxycarbonyl, carboxy, a halogen e.g. a chlorine atom, or cyano or R2 and R3 together repre sent the atoms necessary to complete a 5 or 6 membe red unsaturated carbocyclic ring e.g. a cyelopentene, cyclohexene, cyclopentadiene, or benzene ring, which may be substituted e.g. with alkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, aryl or substituted aryl, acylamido or substituted acylamido, carbamoyl or substituted carbamoyl, sulpha moyl or substituted sulphamoyl, sulpiloamino, alkoxy carbonyl, carboxy, nitro, a halogen atom, cyano,or tri fluoroalkyl and 4R represents an aroyl group, an arylcarbamoyl group, or an alkylcarbamoyl group. The present invention also provides a photographic multilayer colour element comprising three silver halide emulsion layers,which are differently optically sensitized and wherein the novel colour coupler s as set forth above is are present in a blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer or in a non light sensitive colloid layer in waterpermeable relationship therewith. The invention also provides the production of a photographic colour image by development of a photographic element containing image wise exposed silver halide with the aid of a developing agent, which by reduction of the exposed silver halide is converted into its oxidized form and as such forms a yellow azomethine dye by reaction with a novel colour coupler as set forth above. The yellow forming couplers of the invention possess in addition to high coupling activity, a high solvolytic stability in acid as well as in alkaline aqueous medium in contrast with many other 2 equivalent yellow forming couplers that comprise a heterocyclic coupling off group and which hydrolyse in acid and or alkaline medium. The colour couplers of the invention can be readily prepared by reaction between an appropriately substituted 2 equivalent acylacetanilide colour coupler with chlorine as a group that can be split off and a 2 arylcarbamoylimidazole, a 2 alkylcarbamoyl imidazole, or a 2 aroylimidazole. The 2 arylcarbamoyl imidazoles and 2 alkylcarbamoylimidazoles can be prepared readily and inexpensively according to the method described by E.P. Papadopoulos in Journal of Organic Chemistry, 42, 3925 29 1977 according to the reaction schemeEMI5.1 wherein R5 is an alkyl group or an aryl group. The 2 acyl imidazoles can be prepared easily and very economically according to the following reaction schemeEMI5.2 R6 being an aryl group. This method has been described by L.A.N. Bastiaansen and E.R. Godefroi in Synthesis 676 7 1978 . Representative examples of novel yellow forming colour couplers corresponding to the above general formula are given in the following table 1. However, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to these specifically mentioned colour couplers.

As mentioned before the yellow forming couplers of the invention have a high solvolytic stability in acid as well as in alkaline medium.

The yellow forming colour couplers according to the present invention are of the non diffusing type since they comprise in their molecule an organic group sufficiently large to prevent the colour coupler from wandering from the colloid layer, in which the colour coupler has been incorporated, to another colloid layer. For the preparation of a photographic multilayer colour element the non diffusing colour couplers for each of the colour separation images are usually incorporated into the coating compositions of the differently sensitized silver halide emulsion layers. Yet, the non diffusing colour couplers can also be added to the coating compositions of non light sensitive colloid layers that are in water permeable relationship with the ljht sensitive silver halide emulsion layers. During the preparation of the light sensitive colour element the non migrating yellow forming colour couplers according to the above general formula can be incorporated in the coating composition of the silver halide emulsion layers or other colloid layers in waterpermeable relationship therewith according to any technigue known by those skilled in the art for incorporating photographic ingredients, more particularly colour couplers, into colloid compositions. The yellow forming colour couplers according to the invention can be dispersed, occasionally in the presence of a wetting or dispersing agent, in a hydrophilic composition constituting or forming part of the binding agent of the colloid layer. Very suitable wetting agents that can be used to disperse the yellow forming colour couplers of the invention are the fluorine containing surface active agents of the U.K. Patent Application n0 79 07040 filed on 28th February 1979 by Agfa GevaertN.V. For more details about particularly suitable techniques that can be employed for incorporating the colour couplers of the invention into a hydrophilic colloid layer of a photographic element there can be referred to U.K.Patent Specifications 791,219 filed November 9, 1955 by Kodak Ltd., 1,098,594, 1,099,414, 1,099,415, 1,099,416, and 1,099,417, all filed January 25, 1965 by Gevaert Agfa N.V., 1,199,570 filed October 31, 1966 by Agfa Gevaert N.V., 1,218,190 filed October 2, 1968 by Gevaert Agfa N.V., 1,297,947 filed March 20, 1969 by Agfa Gevaert N.V., to the U.S. Patent Specifications 2,269,158 of Michele Martinez, issued January 6, 1942, 2,284,887 of Emil Vollenweider, issued June 2, 1942, 2,304,939 and 2,304,940, both of Leopold D.Mannes andLeopold Godowsky, Jr., issued December 15, 1942, and 2,322,027 of Edwin E.Jelley and Paul W.Vittum, issuedJune 15, 1943, and Belgian Patent Specification 722,026 filed October 9, 1968 by Gevaert Agfa N.V. Another technique for incorporating colour couplers is via polymeric latices as described in the publishedGerman Patent Applications DE OS 2,541,230 and 2,541,274 both filed September 16, 1975 by Eastman Kodak Co. The yellow forming colour couplers according to the invention can be used in conjunction with various kinds of photographic emulsions. Various silver salts can be used as the light sensitive salt. For instance silver bromide, silver iodide, silver chloride or mixed silver halides such as silver chlorobromide, silver bromoiodide, and silver chlorobromoiodide, can be employed. The couplers can be used in emulsions of the mixed packet type as decribed in the U.S. Patent Specification 2,698,794 of Leopold Godowsky, issued January 4, 1955 or emulsions of the mixed grain type as described in the U.S. Patent Specification 2,592,243 of Burt H.Carroll and Wesley T.Hanson, issued April 8, 1952.The colour couplers can be used with emulsions wherein latent images are formed predominantly at the surface of the silver halide crystal or with emulsions wherein latent images are formed predominantly inside the silver halide crystal. The hydrophilic colloid used as the vehicle for the silver halide can be e.g. gelatin, colloidal albumin, zein, casein, a cellulose derivative, a synthetic hydrophilic colloid such as polyvinyl alcohol or poly N vinyl pyrrolidone. If desired, compatible mixtures of two or more of these colloids can be employed for dispersing the silver halide. The hydrophilic colloid may be replaced partly by polymers applied from aqueous dispersions known as latices.Particularly useful latices improving the properties such as flexibility of hydrophilic colloid layers are internally stabilized latices. These latices contain ionogenic monomer units in the polymer chain. Such latices are described e.g. in the United States Patent Specification 2,914,499 and in the published European Patent Application 0 010 335. In the latter Application copolymers are described containing ethyl acrylate units and monomers containing sulphonate groups e.g. monomers prepared by the condensation reaction of ll methacryloylaminoundecanoyl chloride and taurine. Taurine may be advantageously replaced by an aromatic amino sulphonic acid resulting finally e.g. in a monomer having the following structureEMI16.1 These ionogenic monomers may further be used advantageously for the preparGtion of copolymers including photographically useful groups as described e.g. in theEuropean Patent Application 80 200 879 filed September 18, 1980 by Agfa Gevaert N.V. The light sensitive silver halide emulsions used in the preparation of a photographic material according to the present invention can be sensitized chemically as well as optically. They can be sensitized chemically by carrying out the ripening in the presence of small amounts of sulphur containing compounds such as allyl thiocyanate, allyl thiourea, or sodium thiosulphate.The emulsions can also be sensitized by means of reducing agents e.g. thin compounds as described in the FrenchPatent Specification 1,146,955 filed April 11, 1956 byGevaert Photo Producten N.V. and in the Belgian PatentSpecification 568,687 filed June 18, 1958 by Gevaert Photo Producten N.V., imino aminomethane sulphinic acid compounds as described in U.K. Patent Specification 789,823 filed April 29, 1955 by Gevaert Photo ProductenN.V., and small amounts of noble metal compounds such as gold, platinum, palladium, iridium, ruthenium, and rhodium compounds. They can be sensitized optically by means of cyanine and merocyaninedyes. The said emulsions can also comprise compounds that sensitize the emulsions by development acceleration e.g.compounds of the polyoxyalkylene type such as alkylene oxide condensation products as described i.a. in U.S.Patent Specifications 2,531,832 of William AlexanderStanton, issued November 28, 1950, 2,533,990 of RalphKinsley Blare, issued December 12, 1950, in U.K. PatentSpecifications 920,637 filed May 7, 1959, 940,051 filed November 1, 1961 and 945,340 filed October 2i, 1961, all by Gevaert Photo Producten N.V., 991,608 filedJune 14, 1961 by Kodak Co. and 1,091,705 filed May 20, 1965 by Gevaert Photo Producten N.V. and onium derivatives of amino iN oxides as described in U.K. PatentSpecification 1,121,696 filed October 7, 1965 by GevaertAgfa N.V. Further, the emulsions may comprise stabilizers e.g. heterocyclic nitrogen containing thioxo compounds such as benzothiazoline 2 thione and 1 phenyl 2 tetrazoline 5 thione and compounds of the hydroxytriazolopyrimidine type. They can also be stabilized with mercury compounds such as the mercury compounds described in BelgianPatent Specifications 524,121 filed November 7, 1953 by Kodak Co., 677,337 filed March 4, 1966 by Gevaert AgfaN.V., and in the U.K. Patent Specification 1,173,609 filed December 12, 1966 by Agfa Gevaert N.V. The light sensitive emulsion layers containing the colour couplers of the invention and adjacent hydrophilic colloid layers may comprise any other kind of ingredient such as those described for such emulsions and adjacent layers in Research Disclosure no. 17.643 of December 1978 e.g. plasticizers, hardening agents, wetting agents, etc. The non diffusing yellow foreing colour couplers of the present invention are usually incorporated into the blue sensitive silver halide emulsion for forming one of the differently sensitized silver halide emulsion layers of a photographic multilayer colour element.Such photographic multilayer colour element usually comprises a support, a red sensitized silver halide emulsion layer with a cyan forming colour coupler, a green sensitized silver halide emulsion layer with a magenta forming colour coupler, and a blue sensitive silver halide emulsion layer with a yellow forming colour coupler. The emulsions can be coated on a wide variety of photographic emulsion supports. Typical supports include cellulose ester film, polyvinylacetal film, polystyrene film, polyethylene terephthalate film and related films or resinous materials, as well as paper and glass. For the production of photographic colour images according to the present invention an exposed silver halide emulsion layer is developed with an aromatic primary amino developing substance in the presence of a colour coupler according to the present invention.All colour developing agents capable of forming azomethine dyes can be utilized as developers. Suitable developing agents are aromatic compounds such as p phenylene diamines such as NN diethyl p phenylene diamine, N,N dialkyl N sulphomethyl p phenylene diamines and N,N dialkyl N carboxymethyl p phenylene diamines. The following example illustrates the present invention.Example. 114.6 g of blue sensitive silver bromoiodide emulsion 2.3 mole of iodide comprising per kg an amount of 73.4 g of gelatin and an amount of silver halide equivalent to 47 g of silver nitrate were diluted with 127 g of a 7q5 by volume solution of gelatin in 100 ml of distilled water. A dispersion of yellow forming colour coupler was made by dissolving 0.006 mole of the colour coupler as specified in the table hereinafter in 16 ml of ethyl acetate and 2 g of dibutyl phthalate, dispersing the resulting solution in 100 ml of a 5 by volume aqueous solution of gelatin containing 0.4 g of the sodium salt of dodecylbenzene sulphonic acid by means of an ultrasonic power generator, and eliminating the ethyl acetate by evaporation under reduced pressure. The resulting dispersion was added to the bluesensitive silver halide emulsion. After neutralization of the emulsion and addition thereto of the usual additives such as stabilizing agents e.g. 5 methyl 7 hydroxy s triazolo 1 ,5 ayrimidine, wetting agents, and hardening agents the necessary amount of distilled water to obtain 575 g of emulsion was added. The emulsion was coated on a film support in a ratio of 150 g per sg.m. The emulsion layer was dried and covered with a gelatin layer. The dried emulsion material was cut and the resulting strips were exposed in aHerrnfeld sensitometer for 1 20th second through a continuous wedge with a constant of 0 30. After exposure the materials were colour processed in the usual way which includes colour development, bleaching,and fixing. Four developers were used. the first one containing as developing agent N,N diethyl p phenylene diamine sulphate known as TSS developing agent from Agfa Gevaert A.G. developing time 8 minutes and the temperature of development 200C the second one containing as developing agent 2 amino 5 diethylamino toluene hydrochloride known as CD 2 developing agent from Eastman Kodak development time 10 minutes temperature of development 24 C, the third one containing as developing agent 4 amino N ethyl N ss methanesulphonamidoethyl m toluidine sesquisulpilate monohydrate known as GD 3 developing agent from Eastman Soda development time 15 minutes temperature of evelopment 2100, and the fourth one containing as developing agent 4 amino 3 methyl N ethyl N ss hydroxyethyl aniline sulphate known as CO4 developing agent from Eastman Kodak development time 10 minutes temperature of development 2500.
