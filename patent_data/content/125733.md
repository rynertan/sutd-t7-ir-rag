# Complementary IGFET circuit arrangement.

## Abstract
The invention relates to CMOS logic circuits which com prise inverters and which are made compatible to logic sign als at TTL level. The logic circuit according to the invention can be connected selectively controlled by the output voltage of this circuit to different supply voltages, as a result of which in fact two switching levels are obtained. The logic circuit thus obtains a Schmitt trigger behaviour. Further, the CMOST inverter of the logic circuit can now be constructed substan tially symmetrically so that a better quicker switching behaviour is obtained and the values of the switching currents can be kept limited with respect to asymmetrical CMOST inverters.

## Description
Complementary IGFET circuit arrangement The invention relates to a voltage level adaptive circuit arrangement comprising an inverting logic gate circuit of complementary insulated gate field effect transistors, which transistors are arranged between a first and a second supply voltage tapping point, which gate has an output and at least one input. Inverting logic gate circuits of complementary field effect transistors IGFET s or MOSFET s are known per se see, for example, the book MOS LSI Design andApplication , pages 113 115, published in 1972 byMcGraw Hill Book Company and are frequently used.There fore, it is of frequent occurrence that such invertings gate circuits receive control signals which are. supplied by the Transistor Transistor Logic TTL circuits which are also frequently used. The input of the inverting gate circuit therefore should be suitable for the logic TT signals low or 0 level VIL 0.8 V and high tor lt 1 level VIH 2.0 V and therefore the transistors of the complementary inverting logic gate circuit should be constructed very asymmetrically.Although tEswitching level of the gate circuit is then adapted to the switching level of TTL circuits, the aforementioned solution has a few disadvantages, such as the still comparatively, large spread in the switching levels due to spread in the transistor parameters, a high current during change over with high input signals VIH 2.0 V and longer delay times with respect to symmetrically constructed inverting gate circuits. The invention has for its object to provide a complementary IGFET circuit arrangement, in which at high switching speeds a signal level adaptation takers place, which is constructed substantially symmetrically, has a low current consumption both at low and at high switching levels, has a small spread in swithing levels and has aSchmitt trigger characteristic. Due to the substantially symmetrical design of the inverting gate circuit, the same or a shorter signal delay can be realized with respect to the logic gate circuits known per se. A voltage level adaptive circuit arrangement according to the invention is characterized in that the circuit arrangement comprises transistor means which are connected to the second supply voltage tapping point for optionally supplying one of two different supply voltages to the second voltage supply tapping point, which transistor means are provided with a control input which is coupled to the output of the logic gate circuit for choosing the voltage to be supplied to the second voltage supply tapping point in dependence upon the output voltage at the output of the logic gate circuit.When according to the invention the inverting logic gate circuit is connected in series with the transistor means to a supply source and when the output signal of the gate circuit is caused to actuate these transistor means, the possibility is obtained of adapting the switching levels of the gate circuit to the signal levels of the input signals supplied to the input of the gate circuit. The invention will be described more fully with reference to examples shown in the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows an example of a CMOST logic circuit known from the prior art, Figures 2a, b, c and d show simple logic circuits for explanation of the invention, and Figures 3a, b and c are graphs illustrating switching characteristics of the circuit arrangements ofFigures 2a, b and c. Figure 1 shows a logic NOR gate circuit 10 which receives two input signals VI and VE at input terminals 11a, b and 12a, b respectively, and emits an output signal VO at the output terminal 13. The NOR gate is connected to a supply source not shown via supply source terminals D and S. The supply terminal D receives a supply voltage VDD 5 V and the terminal S receives a supply voltage V55 V . The NOR gate 10 is composed of complementary insulated gate field effect transistors P1,P2, N1 and N2, preferably of MOS transistors, of which the transistors P1 and P2 are of the so called P type and the transistors N1 and N2 are of the N type.The transistors N2 and P2 constitute a CMOS inverting circuit and receive at their gates the input signal VI via the input terminals lia, b. The gate circuit 10 will be able to respond to an input signal VI only when the second input signal VE chip enabling signal VE is low , as a result of which the transistor P1 becomes conducting and the transistor N1 is cut off. If such a CMOS circuit has to be controlled by signals on TTL level high level 2.0 V low level 0.8 V produced by TTL circuits, the circuit arrangement should be constructed very asymmetrically, which has the following disadvantages a. a large spread in switching levels which is caused by the spread in transistor parameters b. the occurrence of comparatively large currents in circuit arrangements at high input levels V1ii 2.0 V c. the occurrence of a longer switching delay then in symmetrically constructed gate circuits. According to the invention, the output signal of the inverting gate circuit is used to adapt the supply voltage to be applied to the gate circuit to the voltage levels of the input signals. Figure 2a shows an embodiment f a circuit arrangement according to the invention. The supply voltage tapping point D is connected to main electrodes of the transistor means 30, the further main electrodes of which are connected to a supply source connection terminal DD. A first transistor N4 of the means 30 is of the N type and has a gate electrode which is connected to the terminal DD. A second transistor P4 of the means S is of the P type and its gate is connected to the output 22 of the inverting circuit 20.The means are controlled via the inverting circuit 20 by the signal VO at the output 13 of the gate circuit 10, for which purpose the output 13 of the logic gate circuit 10 is connected to an input of a second CMOST inverting circuit 20. The object of the operation of the inverting circuit 20 and the transistor means 30 will be explained more fully with reference to Figures 2a, b and c andFigures 3a, b and c. The logic gate circuit 10 is a NOR gate and therefore the output signal VO at the output 13 is high if the input signals VI and VE are both low . Starting from this situation, the output voltage would fall from high to low if the input signal VI rises from low to 1 hight . As long as the input signal VI is at the low TTL level 0.8 V , the output signal VO at the output terminal 22 of the inverting circuit 20 will also be low Ass . Therefore, the transistor P4 is fully conducting and the supply voltage tapping point D of the gate circuit 10 is increased to the voltage VDD If the voltage at the gate of the transistor P4 is continuously held at the potential Vss, as indicated inFigure 2b, the voltage VO will decrease from VDD to zero V, as is shown in Figure 3b, if the input signal VI at the input terminal 11 of the gate circuit 10 increases from zero V to VDD. In this situation VI VO VDD andVO zero , the connection between the output 22 of the inverting circuit 20 and the gate of the transistor P4 will cause the latter transistor to be cut off. The voltage tapping point D is then connected via the transistor N4 to the supply voltage VDD. The transistorN4 is connected as a load transistor.Since the transistorP4 is not in the conducting condition, the voltage at the tapping point D will no longer be increased to the voltage VDD If the voltage at the gate of the transistor P4 is continuously held at the potential VDD, as is shown in Figure 2c, the voltage at the tapping point D will be lower than the voltage at the tapping point D in Figure b. Therefore, by decreasing input voltage VI and VDD to zero V, the output voltage VO will increase from zero V to a value considerably lower than the voltage VDD this value can be adjusted by the transistor N4 . The voltage at the gate of the transistor P4 is not kept constant, however, because the voltage VO see Figure 2a decreases from VDD to Vss in dependence upon the output voltage VO athe output terminal 13. Initially, VO is equal to VDD and the transistor P4 is in the cut off condition. If the input voltage VI decreases and as long as the trans is tor P4 is cut off, the output voltage VO will initially vary increase according to the curve LE, as is shown in Figure 3c.However, as soon as the input voltage VI has fallen below VIH and decreases further to VIL, the output voltage VO will increase to such a level 1 V VO o 2 V that the output voltage VO at the output 22 decreases to such a level that the transistor P4 becomes conducting. This results in that the output voltage VO is increased to a slightly higher level, which of course leads to a further decrease of the output voltage VO of the inverter 20. Due to this cumulative phenomenon regenerative feedback , the voltages VO andVO will continuously influence each other until VO has decreased to such a level that the transistor P4 is fully conducting.This means that the output voltage VO is increased at a given input voltage VI in this example 1.2 V between VIL and V from the level on the curve LE in Figure 3c to a level on the curve HE of Figure 3b.Figure 3a shows the curve L which follows the output voltage VOaid which is composed of the low end LE and the high end HE of the curves of Figures 3c and 3b, respectively. Figure 3a indicates a further part L of the curve of Figure 3a by a broken line to illustrate the influence of the selection of voltages which are applied tc tlle voltage tapping point D. Taking the aforementioned facts into account, it cati be simply recognized what will happen in the circuit arrangement shown in Figure 2a if the input voltage VI increases from V55 to VDD. Initially, the output voltage VC vill follow the high end portion HE of the curve shown in Figure 3b because the transistor P4 is fully conducting.The input voltage VI increases to a level above VIL, which results in that the voltage VO will decrease from VDD to a lower value according to the curve HE Figure 3b .The input voltage VI further increases to, for example, 1.6 V and the output voltage VO will decrease to below 2 V.At this output voltage VO, the voltage VO at the output 22 of the inverter 20 will increase to such a level that the transistor P4 becomes less strongly conducting. This results in that the output voltage VO decreases still further. Also in this case, the variations of the voltagesVO and VO will have a cumulative effect one on the other until the transistor P4 is fully cut off. This means that the voltage VO has fallen from the high end HE of the curve in Figure 3b to the low end LE of the curve inFigure 3c. The resulting switching characteristic H for the voltage VO, with which the input voltage VI increases from 0 V to VDD, is shown in Figure 3a. In order to illustrate the gain achieved due to the regenerative feedback, the low end H of the curve of Figure 3b is indicated by a broken line in Figure 3a. Due to the different voltage levels at the voltage tapping point D for the gate circuit 10, it is possible that the level of the increasing input voltageVI, at which the output voltage VO decreases from high to low, is higher than the level of the decreasing input voltage VI, at which the output voltage increases from low to high. The gate circuit therefore has obtained a Scilmitt trigger characteristic. Figure 2d shows in detail the circuit arrangement of Figure 2a. The NOR gate 10 is identical to the NOR gate shown in Figure 1, although the P type and N type transistors of the gate 10 in Fig. 2d are constructed more symmetrically than the transistors in Figure 1 if the latter circuit is TTL compatible. The inverting circuit 20 comprises two CMOS transistors P3 and N3, whose gates are connected to the input 21, which is connected to the output 13 of the NOR gate 10. The output 22 of the inverting circuit 20 is connected to the gate of the transistorP4 P type MOS transistor of the transistor means 22. The transistor means 30 comprise a further transistor N4 N type MOS transistor , whose main electrodes are connected parallel to the main electrodes of the transistor P4. The gate of the transistor N4 is connected through the supply source connection terminal DD to the S 1 supply voltage VDD so that the transistor N4 acts as a load transistor. As will be appreciated, the invention is not limited to the embodiments described above, but can be used in principle in any complementary insulated gate field effect transistor circuit arrangement comprising inverting logic circuits, such as NAND, NOR
