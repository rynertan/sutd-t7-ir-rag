## Description
ANTIOXIDANT FOR POLYESTER FLUIDS OC METHYL N PHENYLBENZENEMETHANAMINE Advanced automotive, aircraft and other industrial equipment require lubricating oils that are effective at elevated temperatures. Polyesters, polyolefins, polyglycols, polyphenyl ethers, phosphates, silicones, etc. have been used as suitable lubricating oils. These lubricating oils undergo oxidative degradation at elevated temperatures. Loss of lubricating properties due to oxidative breakdown of these oils may cause failure of a part, or parts, in contact with the oils. The prior art discloses the stabilization of lubricating oils using various amines including diphenyl and substituted diphenylarnines, p phenylenediamine and substituted naphthylamine.There appears to be no recognition of the use of secondary amines wherein one of the groups attached the amino nitrogen is an aromatic or substituted aromatic ring and the other group is an aliphatic carbon which in turn is attached to an aromatic or substituted aromatic ring. U.S. Patent 1,469,245 discloses N 0 Hydroxybenzyl N phenyl p phenylene diamine as an anti degradant for rubber.This compound belongs to the class of phenylene diamines which are known anticxidants. Furthermore, its use as a stabilizer for lubricating oils is neither disclosed in that patent, nor elsewhere. U.S. Patent No. 2,108,147 teaches a method for preparing secondary and teritary amines including 1 anilino 1 phenylethane.Hickenbottom teaches a phenylamine compound designated as alpha phenylethyl p toluidine see Journal of the Chemical Society 1934 pages 319 322. Beilstein discloses a phenyl amine compound of the general formulaEMI1.1 wherein R can be phenyl see Handbuch Der Organishen Chemie 4thEd., Vol XII Pat. IV pages 2403 4. None of the aforegoing compounds are taught to be antioxidants. It has surprisingly been found that certain amino compounds are effective as antioxidants. These amino compounds have the general formulaEMI2.1 wherein Y is EMI2.2 When Y is the moiety of formula if , Z is H or C1 to C3 alkyl andX and R2 are each independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C1 C12 alkyl, C1 C12 alkoxy C2 C18 carbalkoxy, halogen, or nitro and R1 is hydrogen, C1 C12 alkyl, C C alk oxy, C2 C18 carbalkoxy, halogen, amino or nitro. When Y is the moiety of formula III , R1 and R3 are each independently selected from the group of moieties set forth as R1 above and R2 is as previously defined. The compounds of this invention are novel compounds when X and Z are each independently selected from the group H and C1 C3 alkyl and R1 and Rf, are as previously defined except that they may not simultaneously be hydrogen when Z is hydrogen. In its preferred embodiment the antioxidants of this invention are used in conjunction with a metal deactivator and a metal or metal salt. The preferred metal salts are oil soluble organic salts, e.g., metal naphthenates. This invention relates to a compound for the stabilizing lubricating oils against oxidation and sludge formation. In particular this invention relates to stabilizing such oils utilizing phenylated benzylamines or phenylated tetrahydro naphthylamines, which may be substituted or unsubstituted, either alone or in conjunction with a metal deactivator and a metal compound. This stabilizer system provides a surprisingly high degree of resistance to oxidative breakdown of lubricating oils as well as resulting in dramatic reductions in sludge formation. Certain of the phenylated benzylamines and phenylated tetrahydro naphthylamines used in the practice of this invention are novel compounds. This invention relates to stabilizing a lubricating oil utilizing as the stabilizer an anti√≤xidant which is an amino compound having the general formulaEMI3.1 wherein Y is EMI3.2 When Y is the moiety of formula if , Z and X are each independently selected from the group consisting of H or C1 to C3 alkyl R2 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C 1 to C12 alkyl, Cl C12 alkoxy C2 C18 carbalkoxy, halogen, or nitro and R1 is hydrogen, C1 C12 alkyl, C1 C12 alkoxy, C2 C18 carbalkoxy, halogen, amino or nitro. When Y is the moiety of formula III , R1 and R3 are each independently selected from the group of moieties set forth as R1 above and R2 is as previously defined. The compounds of this invention are novel compounds when X and Z are each independently selected from the group consisting of H and C1 C3 alkyl and R1 and R2 are as previously defined except that they may not be simultaneously hydrogen whenZ is hydrogen. In its preferred embodiment Z is H or methyl andX is methyl. Illustrative non limiting examples of the novel antioxidants of this invention areN alpha methyl p octylbenzyl aniline N alpha methyl p nonylbenzyl aniline N alpha methyl benzyl p nonylaniline N alpha methyl benzyl p dodecylaniline N C alpha methyl benzyl p methoxyamline N alpha methyl benzyl m methoxyaniline N alpha methyl benzyl o methoxyaniline N alpha methyl benzyl m carbethoxyaniline N alpha methyl benzyl o carbethoxyaniline N alpha methyl benzyl p chloroaniline N alpha methyl benzyl m chloroanillne N alpha methyl benzyl o chloroaniline N alpha, alpha dimethylbenzyl aniline 1 p dodecylanilino i, 2, 3 ,4 tetrahydronaphthalene l p carb carbethoxyanilino 1 ,2,3, 4 tetrahydronaphthalene N p acetyl alpha methyl benzyl aniline and I ,4 bis 1 anilinoethyl benzene.The preferred antioxidants of this invention are N alpha methyl p octylbenzyi aniline andN C alpha methyl benzyl p nonylaniline. Addition of the amines described above to lubricating oils imparts an unexpectedly high degree of resistance to oxidative breakdown. The amines of this invention are useful in stabilizing a wide range of lubricating oils including polyester oils, mineral oils and synthetic trydrocarbon oils. The stabili er system of this invention is particularly effective for use in polyolester lubricating oils. The polyolester lubricating oils for which the stabilizer systems of this invention are suitable are synthetic lubricants based upon one or more organic carboxylic acid esters. Illustrative examples of such oils are diesters such as dioctyl sebacate or dinonyl adipate prepared by the reaction of a dibasic acid and a monohydric alcohol triesters such as trimethylolpropane tripelorgonate or trimethylolpropane tricaprilate prepared by the reaction of trimethylol propane and a monobasic acid tetraesters such as pentaerythritol tetracaprilate prepared by the reaction of pentaerythritol and a monobasic acid esters of trimethylolpropane or pentaerythritol prepared by reaction with mixtures of monobasic acids or complex esters prepared by reacting mixtures of monobasic acids, dibasic acids and polyhydric alcohols. The synthetic hydrocarbon oils to which the stabilizer system of this system of this invention may be added are oligomers of alpha olefins. The preferred alpha olefins are C3 C14 alphaolefins. Normally, these hydrocarbon oils have a number average molecular weight of about 280 to about 2,000 preferably about 350 to about 1,500. These lubricating oils have low unsaturation preferably having an iodine number of less than 3. The term antioxidant when used in the specification and claims means the substituted phenylated amines and substituted tetrahydronaphthylamines of this invention The term stabilizer system as used in the specification and claims means the aforegoing antioxidants in conjunction with a metal compound and a metal deactivator. The metal may be present either as the free metal or a salt of a metal. The salt must be soluble in the lubricating oil and is preferably an organometallic salt. The preferred salts include naphthenates, stearates, acetylacetonates, octoates, decanoates etc. The metal deactivators useful in the practice of this invention are benzotriazole and benzotriazole derivatives. The benzotriazole derivative can be alkyl substituted or diallyl amino alkyl substituted preferably dialkyl amino alkyl substituted.Substitution is on the secondary nitrogen of the triangle. The alkyl group can be a C1 to C20 alkyl and each alkyl may be the same or different than the others. Preferably the alkyl groups are selected to give the benzotriazole derivative sufficient oil solubility to be incorporated into the lubricant in an effective amount e.g.C6 C12 alkyl. Typical of such compounds is Reomet 38 marketed byCiba Geigy Co. The term metal deactivator as used in the specification and claims means a compound which when added to a lubricant will neutralize the catalytic effect of metals e.g. copper in promoting oxidation. The various components of the antioxidant system which may be added in any order are used in the following amounts. The antioxidant of this invention is used in amounts varying from about 0.5 to about 5.0 parts by weight per 100 parts of the oil, preferably, about 1.0 to about 4.0 parts more preferably 2.0 to 2.5 parts. The metal deactivators can be used in amounts of about 0.05 to about 1.0 part by weight per 100 parts of the oil, preferably, 0.1 to 0.3 part. Metal or metal salts are used in the amounts of about 1 to about 25 parts of metal by weight per million parts of the oil preferably 2 to 10 parts. The preferred metal is copper. The criteria used herein to evaluate the effectiveness of an antioxidant for lubricating oils are 1 the amount of sludge produced, 2 the change in initial viscosity, 3 the change in neutralization number and, 4 the weight change of the test metals. These criteria are determined after the oil containing the antioxidant system of this invention has been aged for 72 hours at 3700F or after the oil containing the antioxidant system has been aged for 48 hours at 4250F. The benefits of the antioxidants and stabilizers of this invention may be more readily appreciated by reference to the following examples. The term polyolester as used in the specification and claims means a polyester prepared from a polyol by reacting the polyol with a stochiometric equivalent of mono basic acids. EXAMPLE 1 This example shows the unexpected ability of the antioxJdant of the present invention to protect polyester based lubricating oils against oxidative degradation. The oil used was a commercially available polyolester fluid, Hercolube A marketed byHercules Inc. and believed to be one prepared from pentaerythritol and a mixture of monocarboxylic acids, e.g., valeric acid and pelargonic acid. Experiments were carried out in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the antioxidant. The oil sample used in runs B and C was prepared by adding N alpha methylbenzyl aniline in the amount set forth in Table I to 100 grams of the polyolester based oil. Sample D was similarly prepared containing phenyl alpha naphthylamine, a commercially available stabilizer. The amounts used in each case are set forth in Table I. Each of the samples was tested according to the following test procedures A 100 ml. sample having the compositions set forth in Table I is poured into a pyrex glass test cell and aged by inserting one end of a glass air delivery tube into the test cell while the remaining 25 ml. portions of each original oil sample is set aside and analyzed for neutrali zation number and Kinematic Viscosity in centistokes at 100OF. Around this glass air delivery tube immersed in the oil was placed from zero to four metal washers Mg, Cu, Ag, and Fe as identified in Table 1. When more than one washer was used, they were separated from each other by glass spacers. These remained in the oil during the aging process and served to indicate the extent of corrosion of the oil oxidative decomposition products on the metal. The test cell was then fitted with a reflux condenser. The assembly was placed in a constant temperature aluminum block. An air hose was then attached to the other end of the air delivery tube and the air flow was adjusted so that five liters of air per hour was bubbled through the oil. This aging test was carried out for 48 hours at 425OF. After aging, the oil was filtered hot and the amount of sludge developed was collected and was determined and recorded in milli grams per 100 ml. of the oil. The filtered oil was then analyzed to determine changes in neutralization number and Kinematic Viscosity at 1000F. The neutralization number was determined by the colorindicator titration method according to ASTM Procedure D974 55T. The Kinematic Viscosity was determined according toASTM Procedure D445 53T. The metal washers, which were weighed initially, were then carefully washed and weighed again to determine the weight change In grams. The data in Table I dramatically show that when an amine such as N alpha methybenzyl aniline is added to a polyolester based lubricating oil the aged properties of oil Samples B and C are.excellent as noted by very little change in the viscosity or neutralization number, very low sludge and essentially no weight change in the metals. The amine antioxidant clearly provides better all around protection than a commercially available stabilizer Sample D . It should be noted that Sample C, wherein the test was conducted in the presence of copper, was slightly more deteriorated than Sample B, where no copper was present.

The samples were prepared as in EXAMPLE I. The data in Table III shows that a stabilizer system containing N alpha mcthylbenzyl aniline and Reomet 38 is ineffective in the absence of copper Sample A, Table III in decreasing the amounts of sludge, maintaining low viscosity, low neutralization number, and protecting the metal washers from oxidation.In the absence of copper, Reomet 38 functions as a pro degradant.The data in Table III further shows that increasing amounts of copper above 10 ppm causes the stabilizer system to exhibit a decrease in its efficiency in controlling oxidative breakdown.

EXAMPLE V This example demonstrates how the stabilization of a polyolester based lubricating oil is affected by changes in the level of N alpha methylbenzyl aniline while maintaining constantReomet 38 level in the presence of a constant amount of copper metal. The samples were prepared as in EXAMPLE I, using the amounts of ingredients as shown in Table V. The data in Table V show that when a level of about 2.0 to 3.0 parts of N alpha methylbenzyl aniline was used together with 0.2 part of Reomet 38, a polyolester based lubricating oil is effectively stabilized. The preferred level of N aIpha methylbenzyl aniline is shown to be from 2.0 to 2.5 parts. It can be seen from the results of Table V that the level of the N alpha methylbenzyl aniline is critical in producing polyolester based lubricating oils having outstanding aged physical properties while maintaining Reomet 38 at a constant level.

EXAMPLE VI This example demonstrates how various substituted Nbenzylanilines effect the stabilization of a polyolester based oil while maintaining a constant Reomet 38 level in the presence of a constant amount of copper metal. Substituted N benzylanilines were prepared by catalytic hydrogenation of thX corresponding Schiff s bases. Five percentPd c was used as the catalyst and ethanol was used as the solvent for hydrogenating the Schiff s bases. Schiff s bases, in turn, were prepared by the reaction of the appropriate ketones and anilines in the presence of molecular seives. About 40 grams of molecular sieves Linde 5A were added to 1.0 mole of ketone and 1.0 to 1.2 moles of aromatic amine in 200 ml. of benzene see Kazuo Taguchi and F. H. Westheimer, J. ORG. CHEM. 36, 1570 1971 . The reaction mixture was refluxed with continuous removal of water until almost no free ketone could be detected in the reaction mixture byI. R. spectroscopy. The mixture was then filtered and the molecu kr selves washed with benzene.The filtrate and washings were combined and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by either crystallization or by vacuum distillation. The samples were prepared and tested as in EXAMPLE I using the amounts of ingredients as shown in Table VI. The data in Table VI clearly show that substituted benzylanilines of this invention stabilize polyolester based lubricating oils with respect to oxidative breakdown. Substitution on the aromatic ring of the benzyl group seems to have little adverse effect.
