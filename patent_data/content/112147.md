# CONTINUOUS ENZYMATIC PROCESS FOR PRODUCING MALTOSE FROM STARCH AND STARCH HYDROLYSATES

## Abstract
An immobilized beta amylase supported on a phenolic resin of defined total surface area and porosity is useful in preparing a high maltose syrup in a continuous process from starch hydrolysate by continously contacting the starch hydrolysate with the immobilized beta amylase.
