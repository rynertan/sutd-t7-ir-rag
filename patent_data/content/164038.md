## Description
A METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION OF A FLUID FOR TRACTION DRIVEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of a fluid for traction drive or, more particularly, to a method for the preparation of a fluid for traction drive having a remarkably increased traction coefficient. A fluid for traction drive is employed in a variety of traction drive apparatuses such as continuously variable transmissions. Along with the requirement for a smaller and more compact design, apparatuses of this type for power transmission are required to be capable of being driven at a high velocity and under a high load as a trend in recent years. Therefore, it is eagerly desired to develop a highperformance fluid for traction drive capable of withstanding severer and severer working conditions. Various compounds have been hitherto proposed as usable as a fluid for traction drive, of which those compounds having two or more naphthenic rings in a molecule are known to belong to a class of preferable ones. The inventors also have since long pertained extensively to the investigations for the development of a high performance fluid for traction drive and proposed several compounds, of which it has been disclosed that a compound represented by the structural formulaEMI1.1 in which each of the symbols R11 to R15 denotes a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and each of the suffixes r, s and t is an integer of 1, 2 or 3, is particularly preferable as a fluid for traction drive with a remarkably large traction coefficient, in particular, at elevated temperatures. On the way of the development works of the above mentioned compound usable as a base stock of a fluid for traction drive, the inventors have become aware that the performance of the compound as a fluid for traction drive depends considerably on the conditions of the manufacturing process or, in particular, of the step of the hydrogenation reaction to give different values of the traction coefficient.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a novel and improved method for the preparation of the compound represented by the above given general formula I and having a large traction coefficient with a remarkably small temperature dependence with reproducibility. Another object of the invention is to provide a method in which the compound represented by the general formula I can be imparted with a remarkably and reproducibly increased traction coefficient by virtue of the improvement in the conditions of the hydrogenation reaction or, in particular, proper selection of the catalyst used in the hydrogenation reaction. Thus, the method of the invention for the preparation of a compound represented by the above given general formula I , i.e. a decahydronaphthyl and cyclohexyl substituted alkane compound, usable as a fluid for traction drive comprises hydrogenating a compound represented by the general formulaEMI3.1 in which each of the symbols R1 to R8 denotes a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, X R9 p R10 q denotes a group of the formula or R9 and R10 each being a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and each of the suffixes k, 1, m, n, p and q is an integer of 1, 2 or 3, in the presence of a catalyst of a platinum group metal selected from the class consisting of ruthenium, platinum, rhodium and iridium.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIGURES 1 and 2 graphically show the traction coefficients of the compounds prepared in the Examples andComparative Examples as a function of the temperature. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The compound represented by the above given general formula II or III and used as the starting material in the inventive method is a known compound and can be prepared by various methods. For example, tetrahydronaphthalene, naphthalene or a derivative thereof and styrene, vinylcyclohexane or a derivative thereof are reacted in the presence of an acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid and the like and separation of the reaction product by distillation under reduced pressure into fractions gives the desired compounds. Examples of the compounds represented by the general formula II or III are 1 5 1,2,3, 4 tetrahydronaphthyl l phenyl ethane 1 6 1,2,3, 4 tetrahydronaphthyl 1 phenyl ethane l l naphthyl l phenyl ethane l 2 naphthyl 1 phenyl ethane 2 6 1,2,3, 4 tetrahydronaphthyl 2 phenyl propane 1 6 1,2,3, 4 tetrahydronaphthyl 1 cyclohexyl ethane benzyl naphthalene l methylnaphthyl l phenyl ethane l dimethylnaphthyl l phenyl ethane 1 6 1,2,3, 4 tetra hydronaphthyl l 4 tert butyl phenyl ethane and the like. The compound represented by the general formula I can be prepared by the catalytic hydrogenation of the compound represented by the general formula II or III . The catalyst used in this hydrogenation reaction is preferably a catalyst of a platinum group metal selected from the class consisting of ruthenium, platinum, rhodium and iridium and these active ingredients of the catalyst are, in most cases, supported on a conventional catalyst carrier such as silica, alumina, active carbon and the like although the form of the catalyst is not limited thereto. Preferable reaction conditions in the hydrogenation treatment include a reaction temperature in the range from 10 to 3000C, preferably from 50 to 2000C and a reaction pressure in the range from 1 to 200 kg cm2G, preferably from 5 to 50 kg cm2G. Examples of the compound represented by the general formula I as the reaction product of the inventive method are l 2 decahydronaphthyl l cyclohexyl ethane of the formulaEMI5.1 l l decahydronaphthyl l cyclohexyl ethane of the formulaEMI5.2 1 2 decahydronaphthyl 1 4 tert butylcyclohexyl ethane of the formulaEMI5.3 1 l decahydronaphthyl I 4 tert butylcyclohexyl ethane of the formulaEMI5.4 l dimethyldecahydronaphthyl 1 cyclohexyl ethane of either one of the formulasEMI6.1 andEMI6.2 l methyldecahydronaphthyl l cyclohexyl ethane of either one of the formulasEMI6.3 andEMI6.4 2 decahydronaphthyl 2 cyclohexyl propane of the formulaEMI6.5 l decahydronaphthyl l cyclohexyl methane of the formula and the like.EMI6.6 The compound represented by the formula I obtained by the method of the present invention has a remarkably increased traction coefficient in comparison with those obtained by the hydrogenation using other conventional catalysts such as nickel and the like so that this compound is very excellent as a fluid for traction drive. The reason therefor is presumably that the decahydronaphthalene derivatives as the reaction product of the inventive method contain a predominant amount of the cis isomeric molecules in respect of the configuration of the decahydronaphthalene nucleus in which the hydrogen atoms at the 9 and 10 positions are in the cis orientation relative to each other. The compound obtained by the method of the invention can be used as such as a base stock of a fluid for traction drive having a large traction coefficient with a remarkably small temperature dependence thereof in a wide range of temperature. Therefore, traction drive apparatuses using the fluid prepared by the inventive method can be designed remarkably compactly and are capable of running even under very severe operation conditions of high temperatures and high loads so that they are applicable to a wide variety of machines such as continuously variable transmissions for automobiles and industrial machines and hydraulic machines.
