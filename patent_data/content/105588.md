# Electrically controlled shift actuator.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an electrically controlled shift actuator 110, 120, 130 and a control system 140 therefor of the type utilizing a rotational member in the form of a cam 32 or scotch yoke flywheel 64 adapted to move a shift member 28, 96 to a preselected one of at least two spaced apart shift positions. In one embodiment the shift member is in a preloaded condition provided with resilient biasing means 54, 84 associated with the actuator. The control system employs a circuit having a control switch means 100 , a first switch means 108 , and a second switch means 112 interconnectable in such a manner that means 70 respon sive to the rotational position of the motor is able to change the condition of the first and second switching means in a prescribed manner to move the shift member. The control system preferably includes energy dissipating means 120 for dynamically braking the motor and speed indicating means 124 when the actuator is used as a shift actuator for a vehicle.
