## Abstract
Alarm system and method for detecting the movement of an object away from a predetermined position, such an object being typically an item on display in a shop or a door in a closed position. The alarm system comprises a sensing circuit 12 which includes two electrical conductors 10, 11 spaced from but adjacent each other and adjacent to the predetermined posi tion to be occupied by at least one item 15 18 when in use. The sensing circuit 12 includes a signal generator respon sive to the capacitance present between the two conductors 10, 11 to provide a first output condition indicative of a substantially constant capacitance value present between the electrodes due to the undisturbed presence of the item 15 18 and to provide a second output condition indicative of a change in capacitance value due to the disturbance of the item or items 15 18 present. The output of the sensing circuit 12 is received by an alarm actuating circuit 13 which causes actuation of an alarm element 6 when the output condition from the sensing circuit 12 changes significantly to cause the actuating circuit 13 to trigger due to the movement of the item 15 18 from its predetermined position.

## Description
The invention relates to an alarm system capable of detecting wnen an article is removed from a predetermined position. In known alarm systems used to deter or detect shop lifters for example, each article on an open display has been interconnected in a loop by means of a wire coupled to an alarm. Such a system is obtrusive and tends to detract from the display. Adding or removing articles with such a display requires disconnecting the interconnected wires in the loop which can become tedious. An alternative known system makes use of pressure pads which are connected to an alarm and removal of an article triggers this alarm. In such a system it is necessary to have a pressure pad for each article on display if removal of one is to be detected and tus changes in the number of articles displayed requires addition or removal of one or more pads and changes in the system connections. Thus such a system does not lend itself to frequent changes in the display. It has also been proposed to use the capacitive effect of displayed articles to trigger an alarm by a system which uses a metal sheet as a conductor connected to an alarm system and each displayed article is placed on this sheet which overlies a shelf. In such a system effectively it was necessary to measure the capacitance of the particles between this electrode and eart and such a system has been shown to be unreliable due to stray capacitance effects and such a system could instigate.an alarm condition merely by a customer being in the vicinity of the display which proves to be an embarrassmen to both the customer and the shop keeper. The present invention is concerned with a system which overcomes the above drawbacks to provide a reliable, flexible and typically unobtrusive system which can cope with a number of articles together if required. According to the invention there is provided an alarm system for indicating the removal of an article from a predetermined position comprising a sensing circuit means including i two electrical conductors spaced from but adjacent each other and for positioning adjacent to the predetermined position to be occupied by at least one article when in use and ii signal generating means responsive to the capacitance present between these conductors to provide a first output condition indicative of substantially constant capacitance value present between the electrodes due to the undisturbed presence of said at least one article and to provide a second output condition indicative of a chance in capacitance value present due to the disturbance of said at least one article, and b alarm actuator means responsive to the output of said sensing circuit means to provide an alarm indication as a result of a change in the output condition of said sensing circuit means whenever a change in capacitance due to the removal of an article occurs. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of detecting and indicating when an article has been removed from a predetermined position comprising providing two electrical conductors spaced from but adjacent each other and adjacent the predetermined position to be occupied by at least one said article, sensing the capacitance present between these conductors to provide a first output condition indicative of substantially constant capacitance value present between the electrodes due to the undisturbed presence of said at least one article and to provide a second output condition when a change in capacitance value due to the disturbance of said at least one article occurs, and actuating an alarm indicator whenever a change in the output condition occurs as a result of the removal of said article. According to a third aspect of the invention there is provided an alarm system for indicating the removal of an article from a predetermined position comprising sensing circuit means including i two electrical conductors spaced from but aadacen each other and for positioning adjacent to the predetermined position to be occupied by at least one article when in use, and ii signal generating means responsive to the capacitance present between these conductors to provide a first output condition indicative of substantially constant capacitance value present between the electrodes due to the undisturbed presence of said at least one article and to provide a second output condition indicative of the rate of change in capacitance value present due to the disturbance of said at least one article, and alarm actuator means responsive to the output of said sensing circuit means to provide an alarm indication as a result of a change in the output condition of said sensing circuit means whenever a rapid change in capacitance due to the removal of an article occurs. According to a fourth aspect of the invention there is provided a method of detecting and indicatinl when an article has been removed from a predetermined position comprising providing two electrical conductors spaced from but adjacent each othe and adjacent the predetermined position to be occupied by at least one said article, sensing the rate of change in capacitance present between these conductors to provide a first output condition indicative of substantially constant capacitance value present between the electrodes due to the undisturbed presence of said at least one article and providing a second output condition when a rapid change in capacitance value due to the disturbance of said at least one article occurs, and actuating an alarm indicator whenever a change in the output condition occurs as a result of the removal of said article. The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIGURE 1 shows a block diagram of the system of the invention, FIGURE 2 shows one configuration for arranging the electrodes adjacent to an object to be protected by the alarm, FIGURE 3 shows one embodiment for realising the system of Figure 1, FIGURE 4 shows an alternative arrangement to Figure 1 which detects rate of change in capacitance, FIGURE 5 shows an embodiment for realising the system of Figure 4, and FIG ERE 6 shows in more detail a suitable configuration for providing the elements of the Figure 5 arrangement. In the basic system of Figure 1, the item or itens to be displayed will be positioned such that they will overlie the electrodes 10, 11 which will typically be provided on top of a display stand but not necessarily in the straight contisaration indicated. The effective capacitance of the items so placed is indicated by capacitor c. The electrodes 10 and 11 are connected to the sensor 12 which produces an output level indicative of the change in the capacitance c. Any object removed from across the electrodes 10 and 11 will cause a rapid change in capacitance and thus the sensor 12 will detect this change and the output thereof will rise. The output of sensor 12 is received by alarm block 13 which compares the sensor level with a predetermined threshold and effects an alarm condition when the threshold is exceeded. The way in which the electrodes can be arranged is shown in Figure 2. The shelf 1 is provided on its upper face with two metallic electrode strips 10, 11 which are arranged typically in an interleaved pattern so that, irrespective of the position of placing an article 15 on the shelf, the base of the article will overlie the two electrodes 10 and 11. The article is assumed to be metallic, or to incorporate metal at or near its base, or to carry a sticker or tag 5 which is made of or incorporates metal. The strips are advantageously self adhesive, and may be for example 3 inch apart, and one eighth to threeeighths of an inch in width. Thin wire could also be used.The sticker could be a small disc of silver paper, for use in the case of glass, china etc. When the disc is placed over the strips, there is an increase of capacitative bridging of the strips 10 and 11. The two electrode strips in this example are connected by the inner and outer portions of a coaxial cable 4 to the sensor arrangement. Although the electrodes 10 and 11 are shown on the upper surface of the self in contact with the article 15 or metallic sticker 5 , it would also be possible to disguise the electrodes by covering these with a thin dry material e.g. cloth , and placing the article on the cloth. Alternatively if the shelf were thin it may be possible to provide the electrodes on its lower surface, although in these latter configurations the sensitivity of the system would be somewhat reduced. An arrangement for realising the system of Figure 1 is shown in Figure 3. The electrodes 10 and 11 are shown interleaved by way of example and suitable positions for a number of articles 15 18 are shown thereon.The electrodes are connected via cable 4 to points A and 3 The sensor 12 consists of a high impedance oscillator employing a field effect transistor FET TRl e.g.2N3819 . Components associated with the oscillator include inductance T1 capacitors 01, C2, C3 and C5 and resistors R1 and R2. The circuit is arranged to go into, and out of, oscillation by the change of capacity occurrirE between the strips. The setting of the oscillator is controlled by the variable capacitor C1 in the gate circuit of the FET, and which is affected by the loading of the shelf when the shelf is loaded with articles, the capacitor Cl is adjusted so that the oscillator is jut not oscillating,When an article is removed from the self, the capacity at the shelf decreases, and allows the oscillator to start working. The output of the oscillator is typically selected to be at R.F. frequency, e.g. 450 470 Kcs., and this output is passeci via capacitor C4 to the amplifier comprised of transistor TR2 with associated resistors R3 and R4. The output from this transistor passes via capacitor C6 and is rectified by the diode D1, and theDC content is fed to the driving circuit comprising power transistor TR3 and associated resistor R5 and capacitor C7 which circuit actuates the relay circuit RL1 and C8 when this DC level exceeds a predetermined threshold. The contacts of the relay are used to switch on any convenient alarm system shown here as a bell 6 powered by battery B1. The oscillator radiates only micro watts, and only does so when an article is removed. The oscillator is not in a state of oscillation, when everything is normal at the shelf. When in this normal state, the supply current used by the equipment is very low. The maximum current is used when an article is removed from the shelf, and triis current mainly consists of that which is consumed by the power transistor and the relay used. It will be appreciated that the oscillator circuit and the relay could be miniaturised and encapsulated. The relay although shown as an electro mechanical device, this could alternatively comprise a solid state switch. By use of a display device coupled to respective relays for each of a plurality of shelves, there may be obtained an indication of which shelf, amongst many, is subject to the removal of an article. When the alarm of indicator means installed at a point remote from the shelf, e.g. at a supervisory post or assistant s location in a shop, the device provides an automatic safeguard against unobserved removal of articles, and moreover dependent on the type of alarm i.e. visual or audible can give notification of an alarm condition without giving any indication of that fact to the person removing the article. The placing of the electrodes as a pair in close proximity to each other and over which the article is placed so as to bridge the electrodes, ensures that stray capacitance effects due to customers or assistants moving in the vicinity of the display are minimised and thus reduce the possibility of false alarm conditicns. Although the system has been described generally for use with an article comprising an object for display, the system is also capable of detecting the movement of other articles away from a predetermined position for example such as in opening of a door or window, a face of which could be provided with a metallic strip for example in the vicinity of the electrodes and any movement eher o. causing actuation of the alarm. In the alternative and preferred arrangement ofFigure 4 a system is shown which rattler ti an sensor 12 detecting a change in ca acitance per se, detects the rate of change in capacitance, so that a relatively large rate of change in capacitance as a result of removal of of an article causes an alarm condition but a small rate of change, caused by liht stray capacntance or circus drift for example will not cause false alarm conditions to be instigated. This rate of change function will now be described with reference to the embodiment of Figure 5. Although not shown, electrodes 10 and 11 could again be coupled via coaxial cable to the sensor 12. Oscillator 20 is a free running oscillator typically 200 kHz . The oscillator output is received by buffer 22 to prevent loading of the oscillator. A filter 21 is provided to remove any r.f. present. The buffered oscillator output passes via pulse shaper 24 to a phase locked loop configuration provided by blocks 26 29 inclusive. The shaped pulses are received by the first comparator 26 which produces an error voltage which passes via low pass filter 27 to control the oscillator 28. The output of the voltage controlled oscillator VCO is used as the other input to comparator 26 so as to allow this comparator to determine the error and adjust the error voltage. Similarly comparator 29 receives the pulses from shaper 24 and the output from VCO 28, so as to again produce an error voltage.This error voltage passes via driver 30 to an integrator 31 where it is integrated. The integrator output is received by alarm trip unit 13 which instigates an alarm condition when this output exceeds a predetermined level. The low pass filter 27 effectively determines the rate at which a change in capacitance c affecting oscillator 20 will cause the VCO to come out of lock and so cause the error voltage at the output of comparator 29 to continuously change as the VCO is searching for a locked situation. Thus this comparator output on integration will effectively cause the alarm to actuate.Thus the low pass filter 27 and integrator 31 provide the facility for determining the rate of change rather than change per se in capacitance c, An arrangement for realising the system of Figure 5 is shown in Figure 6. The oscillator 20 comprises coil I1 e.g. a standard I.F. coil , resistors R1 R3, capacitor C1 C2 and integrated circuit element 40. C8 is a decoupling capacitor, Filter 21 comprises R4 and 03. Buffer 22 comprises C41 R5 and element 41. Pulse shaper 24 comprises R12 and element 46. Driver 30 comprises elements 47, 50, 51 and resistor R9. Integrator 31 comprises element 52, R10, Rll C7 and diode D1. The phase locked loop 26 29 comprises integrated circuit chip 44 and associated components R6 R8, C5,b6 and relay contact A1. The alarm trip 13 comprises elements 428 43, 48, 49, resistors Rlf, R14, diodes D2, D3, light emitting diode 56, relay A and loudspeaker 55 e.g. Piezo transducer U35R . elements 42 and 43 operate in parallel to provide the necessary current handling capability due to the relatively low value of R13. Elements 40 43 can conveniently comprise 4 dual input Nand gates on a single chip e.g. type 4011 . The inputs of each of these elements 40 43 are strapped together so that each functions as an inverter. Chip 44 is a phase locked loop chip e.g. type 4046 . Elements 46 49 can typically comprise 4 Schmitt triggers on a single chip e.g. type 4093 . Elements 50 52 can conveniently comprise 3 out of 4 of the and gates of an I.C. chip e.g. type 4011 , each with inputs strapped to function as inverters. It is convenient to use Nails since these are also used elsewhere although a normal inverter chip could be used. In the system of Figure 3 the output from the integrator is normally low. When a rapid capacitance change occurs, then C7 charges up and the elements 42, 43 go low when C7 reaches about 1 2 rail voltage . TheSchmitts 48, 49 positively select the alarm condition causing the transducer 55 to operate. The relay A is also energised and contact A1 closes and thus R8 is placed in parallel with R7 to relock the phase locked loop more quickly, R7 and C6 forming the low pass filter . C5 and R6 define the center frequency of the VCO. On relocking of the VCO the integrator output will fall and the alarm condition will cease thus de energising relay A, opening its contact A1 and disconnecting R8 thus returning the sensitivity back to the normal condition to again await changes caused by any disturance of capacitance c. Thus in this embodiment the oscillator is free ruzlng whether or not an alarm condition is occuring. Any slight changes in capacitance will cause the oscillator frequency to vary but this variation can be followed by the phase locked loop system. A rapid capacitance change however will cause the loop error to become large and thus on integration cause an alarm condition to be instigated. mhe system will automatically relock into a standby condition on de energisation of relay A.This locking into a standby condition will also occur automatically a short time after articles have been placed on the electrodes when making up the display and thus typically no manual adjustment or setting up of the system is required, other than initially arranging the electrodes in a suitable configuration. Although in this embodiment the system has been generally described as or use with an particle comyris.ing an object for display, this system can alse be used w th articles such as doors or windows which typically cculd be provided on one face with a metallic strip in je vicinity of the electrodes to allow any movement of the door or window by opening to be detected and an alarm condition actuated.
