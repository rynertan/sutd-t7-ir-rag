# X ray image tube.

## Abstract
An X ray image tube has a vacuum envelope 1 , a photo cathode 4 arranged at an input side in the vacuum envelope 1 and having a curved surface open to an output side thereof, and a phosphor screen 12 arranged at an output side in the vacuum envelope 1 and having a surface on which electrons emitted from the photocathode 4 are electrooptically fo cused. The photocathode 4 consists of a central surface re gion with a diameter which is ¹ ₂ to ⁴ ₅ of the diameter of the pho tocathode and a peripheral surface region. The central surface region has a profile such that an increment of the meridional curvature radius from the center to a peripheral portion thereof is larger than a constant derived from a linearity between the increment and a distance from the axis of the photocathode 4 . The peripheral surface region has a profile such that an increment of the meridional curvature radius from an inner pe ripheral portion to an outer peripheral portion is smaller than the constant derived from a linearity between the increment and the distance from the axis of the photocathode 4 .
