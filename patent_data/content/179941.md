# Transparent blends of polymethylmethacrylate and certain styrene copolymers.

## Abstract
Transparent blends of polymethylmethacrylate and alk enyl aromatic vinyl acid copolymer blends and transparent shaped articles made from such blends are taught. The blends contain a polymethylmethacrylate and b at least one copolymer of styrene and or equivalent alkenyl aromatic monomers with one or more of certain vinyl acids and optionally c mass made acrylonitrile butadiene styrene or acry lonitrile butadiene styrene type resin.
