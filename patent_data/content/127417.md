# Process for preparing 1 dimethylaminomethyl triazolobenzodiazepines.

## Abstract
A process for preparing a 1 aminomethyl 6 substituted 4H s triazolo 4,3 a 1,4 benzodiazepine, e.g. adinazolam, directly from the corresponding 1 hydrogen 6 substituted 4H s triazolo 4,3 a 1,4 benzodiazepine, e.g. from estazolam, comprises reacting the estazolam type compound and a dimethylaminomethylene salt in a solvent in the pres ence of an alkali metal carbonate. The product is advantage ously extracted from an aqueous organic solvent mixture thereof into a halogenated C₁ ₃ alkane solvent while maintain ing the pH of the aqueous phase between 3.0 and 4.0, and then recovered.
