## Description
This invention relates to a process for producing a lactam copolymer having excellent impact strength by copolymerizing omega lactam and a diene polymer in accordance with the technique of alkali polymerization of omega lactam. This invention further relates to a process for producing an article, particularly an automobile part, composed of the aforesaid copolymer. The technique of polymerizing omega lactam by the action of an alkaline catalyst and a co catalyst, i.e. the so called alkali polymerization method, is known. A polyamide obtained by this method has excellent mechanical strengths such as tensile strength, flexural strength and initial modulus, and is used as machine parts and industrial materials. However, it cannot be used in applications requiring flexibility since it has low elongation and impact strength and is hard and brittle. Some methods have previously been proposed for the production of a polyamide diene type polymer copolymer in an attempt to improve the impact strength of the polyamide obtained by the alkali polymerization of omega lactam. For example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 15319 1977 discloses a process for producing a polyamide polybutadiene copolymer having impact strength which comprises copolymerizing omega lactam with a butadiene homopolymer or a copolymer of butadiene and a vinyl compound each having hydroxyl groups at both molecular ends by the action of an alkaline catalyst and a polyisocyanate. The copolymer obtained by this process, however, has inferior heat resistance since it contains a urethane linkage resulting from the reaction of the polyisocyanate and polybutadiene in the molecular chains. Another defect is that because the urethane linkage is readily hydrolyzed by the action of the alkaline catalyst, an increase in the amount of the polybutadiene in the polymer does not lead to a significant increase in the impact strength of the resulting copolymer. Japanese Patent Publication No. 43756 1977 discloses a process for producing a polyamide polybutadiene copolymer having impact strength which comprises polymerizing omega lactam by the action of an alkaline catalyst and a polymerization activator obtained by the reaction of a butadiene homopolymer or butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer having carboxyl groups at molecular ends with a diisocyanate. This process, however, requires an extra step of producing the polymerization activator from a carboxyl containing butadiene polymer and a diisocyanate prior to the alkali polymerization of omega lactam. The resulting polymerization activator has a very high viscosity and lends itself to difficult handling so that, for example, a long period of time is required in dissolving it in omega lactam. This is industrially disadvantageous. Moreover, the impact strength of the resulting copolymer is not as high as is satisfactory. U. S. Patent No. 4,031,164 discloses a process for producing a lactam polyol polyacyl lactam terpolymer having excellent impact strength by utilizing the method of alkali polymerization of omega lactam. U. S. Patent No. 4,490,520 discloses a process for producing a polyamide having improved impact strength, which comprises polymerizing lactam in the presence of an alkaline catalyst and the reaction product of a polyfunctional co catalyst and a polyoxyalkyleneamine. Molded articles prepared from the polyamides produced by these processes have the defect of being limited in uses because they have a high rate of water absorption and change greatly in size within short periods of time owing to water absorption. It is an object of this invention is to provide a polyamide diene polymer copolymer being free from the defects of the aforesaid prior processes and having excellent impact strength and a low rate of water absorption. Still another object of this invention is to provide a process for producing an article composed of the aforesaid copolymer. The object of this invention is achieved by a process for producing a lactam copolymer, which comprises copolymerizing an omega lactam and a diene polymer having an amino or imino group at molecular ends by the action of an alkaline catalyst and a polyfunctional co catalyst, the polyfunctional co catalyst being selected from a polyisocyanate, a carbamidolactam, an acid chloride and a polyacyl lactam, the proportions of the components satisfying the following equations I and II The other object of this invention is achieved by a lactam copolymer produced by copolymerizing an omega lactam and a diene polymer having an amino or imino group at molecular ends by the action of an alkaline catalyst and a polyfunctional co catalyst, the proportions of the components satisfying the following expressions I and II The still other object of this invention is achieved by an article composed of the aforesaid copolymer. The invention will now be described in detail. The omega lactam used in this invention is preferably an omega lactam having 4 to 12 carbon atoms. Specific examples of the omega lactam include gamma butyrolactam, delta valerolactam, epsilon caprolactam, omega enantholactam, omega capryllactam, omega undecanolactam and omega lauryllactam. They may be used singly or in combination. The alkaline catalyst may include all alkaline catalysts used in the known alkali polymerization of omega lactams. Specific examples are alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, hydrides, oxides, hydroxides, carbonates, alkylation products and alkoxides of these metals, Grignard s reagent, sodium naphthalene, and the reaction products of these metals or metal compounds with omega lactams, such as sodium or potassium salts of omega lactams. Of these, the sodium or potassium salts of omega lactams are preferred. The alkaline catalyst is used in such a proportion that the ratio of the equivalent weight a of the alkaline catalyst per equivalent of the omega lactam to the equivalent weight c of the diene polymer per equivalent of the omega lactam satisfies the following equation I The equivalent weight c of the diene polymer per equivalent of the omega lactam is 1 when 1 mole of the diene polymer having one amino or imino group at a molecular end is used per mole of the omega lactam, and is 2 when 1 mole of the diene polymer having two amino or imino groups at the molecular ends is used. All polyfunctional compounds used in the known alkali polymerization may be used as the polyfunctional co catalyst. Specific examples include polyisocyanates such as toluene diisocyanate, 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, xylylene diisocyanate, polymethylene polyphenyl polyisocyanate and carbodiimide modified diisocyanates carbamidolactams such as hexamethylene 1,6 bis carbamidocaprolactam, 4,4 diphenylmethane bis carbamidocaprolactam, N phenyl N isopropyl p phenylene bis carbamidocaprolactam and N,N diphenyl p phenylene bis carbamidolactam acid chlorides such as terephthaloyl chloride, adipoyl chloride and sebacoyl chloride and polyacyl lactams such as adipoyl bis caprolactam and terephthaloyl bis caprolactam. Of these, the diisocyanates and carbamidolactams are preferred. The polyfunctional co catalyst is used in such a proportion that the ratio of the equivalent weight b per equivalent of the omega lactam to the equivalent weight c of the diene polymer per equivalent of the omega lactam satisfies the following equation II Examples of the diene polymer constituting the main chain of the diene polymer having an amino or imino group at the molecular ends include a butadiene homopolymer, an isoprene homopolymer, a butadiene styrene copolymer, a butadiene isoprene copolymer, and a butadiene acrylonitrile copolymer. Those diene polymers which are liquid at least at the melting temperatures of the omega lactams are preferred. These diene polymers may dissolve in the molten omega lactams, or may be substantially uniformly dispersed in liquid form in the molten omega lactams. A specific example of the liquid diene polymer is a copolymer of butadiene and acrylonitrile containing imino groups at both molecular ends and having an average molecular weight of 3,000 to 5,000. It is available, for example, from Ube Industries, Ltd. under trademarks HYCAR ATMN 1300x8, HYCAR ATBN 1300x13, HYCAR ATBN 1300x16, and HYCAR ATBN 1300x21. The number average molecular weight of these diene polymers is preferably not more than 20,000, more preferably 400 to 10,000, and above all 500 to 5,000 in view of the ease of dissolution in omega lactams. The amount of the diene polymer used is preferably 1 to 60 by weight, more preferably 3 to 50 by weight, especially preferably 5 to 30 by weight, based on the weight of the omega lactam. If its amount is smaller than the lower limit specified, it is difficult to impart sufficient impact strength to the resulting lactam copolymer. Even if the amount is increased beyond the upper limit, no great difference in effect is noted, and rather the flexural strength or flexural modulus of the resulting lactam copolymer is greatly reduced. Thus, amounts above the upper limit are not practical. The alkali copolymerization of the omega lactam and the diene polymer in accordance with this invention can be carried out by a known method, for example, the melt polymerization method. The polyfunctional co catalyst and the diene polymer may be separately added to the copolymerization reaction system, or may be used as a reaction product prepared by mixing and reacting them prior to the copolymerization. The reaction of the polyfunctional co catalyst with the diene polymer proceeds readily by contacting them with each other at a temperature above room temperature in the presence or absence of an inert organic solvent. The polymerization temperature is preferably above the melting point of the omega lactam to be polymerized but below the melting point of the resulting lactam copolymer. Usually, the polymerization time is not more than 2 hours. In the present invention, the omega lactam may be copolymerized in the presence of plasticizers, fillers, fibers, blowing agents, dyes or pigments, and stabilizers such as an antioxidant which do not substantially inhibit the polymerization reaction. Preferred plasticizers are, for example, N alkylpyrrolidones and dialkylimidazolidinones. Specific examples of the fillers are calcium carbonate, wollastonite, kaolin, graphite, gypsum, feldspar, mica, asbestos, carbon black, and molybdenum disulfide. Specific examples of the fibers include milled glass fibers, fibrous magnesium compounds, potassium titanate fibers, mineral fibers, graphite fibers, boron fibers and steel fibers. The amount of the fillers and or fibers is usually 2 to 50 by weight based on the weight of the omega lactam. Specific examples of the blowing agents are benzene, toluene and xylene, and the amount of the blowing agents is usually 1 to 15 by weight based on the weight of the omega lactam. The present invention is useful as a method of producing molded articles, such as rods, plates, pipes and automobile parts, directly from omega lactams by a casting method or a reactive injection molding method. It is also possible to form chips from the lactam copolymer obtained by this invention and mold the chips into various molded articles, sheets and fibers by injection molding, extrusion, etc. According to this invention, lactam copolymers having high impact strength can be obtained without a decrease in polymerization conversion by using the diene polymer having an amino or imino group at molecular ends which has not been utilized heretofore. It is well known that when the anionic polymerization of omega lactam is carried out in the presence of a compound having active hydrogen, for example an amino group, the polymerization conversion decreases. In view of this, the present invention is characterized by the fact that the polymerization conversion of the omega lactam is not decreased in spite of using a polymer having an amino group. The lactam copolymers obtained by this invention do not undergo hydrolysis by the action of the alkaline catalyst. The process of this invention does not require the production of a polymerization initiator from the polyfunctional co catalyst and the diene polymer having an amino or imino group prior to the alkali polymerization of the omega lactam. Furthermore, the resulting lactam copolymer is characterized by a low rate of water absorption. The following Examples and Comparative Examples illustrate the present invention more specifically.
