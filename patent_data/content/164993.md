# ELECTRICAL FIBRE OPTIC CONNECTOR

## Abstract
A connector for making an optical connection and an electrical connection comprising first and second interen gageable connector parts 11, 12 the first connector part 11 including a first body 14 having an end face at which a connection end or a first optical fibre 16 is exposed, and a first enlongated sleeve 13 within which said first body 14 is housed as a close fit, said first sleeve 13 exending beyond said end face of said first body 14 , the second connector part including a second body having an end face at which a connection end of a second optical fribre 26 is exposed, and a second elongated sleeve 23 within which said second body 24 is housed, the second sleeve 23 extending beyond said end face of the second body 24 . The dimen sions of the first and second sleeves 13, 23 are such that upon interengagement of the connector parts the first sleeve 13 is received as a close sliding fit within the second sleeve 23 , and, the dimensions of the first sleeve 13 and the second body 24 are such that as the first sleeve 13 is received as a close sliding fit in the second sleeve 23 , the second body 24 is received as a close sliding fit in the first sleeve 13 whereby said end faces of said first and second bodies 14, 24 can be brought into abutment accurately to align the exposed connection ends of their respective first and second optical fibres 16, 26 the first and second sleeves 13, 23 and or the first and second bodies 14, 24 being electrically conductive.
