# Fiber optic transducer and method of manufacture therefor.

## Abstract
An optical transducer for converting pressure variations to variations in amplitude of an optical signal. A first optical transmission line 17 is positioned above a base 13 in a manner to maintain its end face stationary while a second optical transmission line 19 is positioned above the base 13 in a manner to permit the axis to be displaced from the axis of the optical fiber 17 with the stationary end face in accor dance with variations of pressure applied thereto. Optical signals propagating in one of the optical transmission lines 17,19 will couple to the other with a coupling factor depen dent upon the displacement of the optical fibers. Under condi tions of continuous pressure variations, such as that created by an incident acoustic wave, the coupled optical signal will be amplitude modulated in accordance with the pressure var iations.
