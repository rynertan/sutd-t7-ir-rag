# Improvements in or relating to ink jet printers.

## Abstract
An ink jet printer for generating a plurality of fluid jet drop streams includes a locating plate 20 having a plate receiving recess 22 and an opening 24 within the recess and through the locating plate. A charge electrode plate 26 is positioned within the recess 22 and has a plurality of electrode openings 28 therethrough which are lined with charge electrodes. Print data conductors 30 are connected electrically to the charge electrodes for selectively supplying charge control signals to the electrodes. A print head 46 includes a fluid receiving re servoir and an orifice plate communicating therewith. The ori fice plate has a plurality of orifices from which fluid jet drop streams emerge. The print head 46 is mounted on the locat ing plate 20 and is positioned by two locating pins 62, 64 which extend from the print head and are received within regis tration openings 66,68 in the locating plate. A drop deflection electrode 142 and drop catchers 96 are also mounted on the locating plate. The locating plate provides a dimensional reference from which the respective positions of the other printer elements may be accurately set.
