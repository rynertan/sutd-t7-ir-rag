# CONDUCTIVE PLASTIC COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
In cases where spark discharges could be dangerous, e.g. explosive factories, chemical plants and operating theatres, it is important to provide footwear soles, floor tiles and the like which are of a controlled electrical conductivity. i.e. not to such a high conductivity that danger of electrocu tion could occur if a wearer touches the electric mans accidentally and not to such a low conductivity that signifi cant charge build up can occur. The present composition is a synthetic plastics material composition comprising a high molecular weight thermo plastics material comprising a segmented copolyether ester polymer, preferably one containing intra polymerised butylene terephthalate hard segments and polytetra methylene ether terephthalate soft segments and, as a conductivity promoting component, a quaternary ammo nium compound preferably with a long chain fatty acid residue and an amine group, such that when moulded or shaped to give a resilient shaped article, the composition has an electrical resistance preferably no greater than 1 10⁸ ohms and no less than 5 10⁴ ohms when measured according to British Standard BS2050.
