# Cadmium sulphide solar cells.

## Abstract
The invention relates to the manufacture of cadmium sulphide solar cells. A cell is formed of a glass substrate 10 , a front contact 12 made, for example, of tin oxide, a cadmium sulphide layer 14 and a copper sulphide layer 16 . The junction between the layers 14 and 16 is photovoltaic. In order to form a contact on the copper sulphide layer, the invention proposes vapour depositing a mixed layer of copper and copper oxide onto the sulphide layer. The invention also describes a method of heat treatment following the forma tion of the rear contact in order to optimise the electrical performance of the cell.
