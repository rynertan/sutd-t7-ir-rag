# Instrument for measurement of the organic carbon content of water.

## Abstract
Apparatus and methods for measurement of total organic carbon content of water, particularly of low relative organic content, is described which features a single sample cell for ex posure of a static sample to ultraviolet radiation comprising electrodes for measuring the conductivity of the water. The conductivity is monitored as a function of time and the second time derivative of the conductivity signal is monitored to indi cate when the oxidation reaction has been completed. Com pensation for the contribution to conductivity of the water sample made by the instrument is achieved by substracting a quantity proportional to the first time derivative of the conduc tivity at a time when the second time derivative reaches zero, indicating that the oxidation reaction is complete, from the change in the total conductivity measurement, the remainder being equal to the contribution to conductivity made by oxida tion of the organic content of the water.
