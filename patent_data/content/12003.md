# Apparatus for manipulating a quantity of radioactive material between a stored position and a use position.

## Abstract
Apparatus for manipulating a quantity of radioactive material between a stored position and a use position is pro vided with a coupling apparatus for separably connecting cable controls to a storage unit at the storage position, having a coupler component fixed to the storage unit and a separable component 40,42 fitted to the control cable. The latter fits into an aperture in the fixed component 20,22,32,34,38 , where it can be locked against removal. The fixed component 20,22,32,34,38 locks the radioactive material leader for safe storage when the control cable is disconnected. Connection of the control cable permits the operator to release the lock on the leader. The act of releasing that lock establishes an inter lock which prevents removal of the separable component 40,42 from the fixed component 20,22,32,34,38 .
