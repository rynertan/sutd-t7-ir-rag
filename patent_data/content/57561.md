## Description
DESCRIPTION MUSCLE STIMULATING APPARATUS The present invention relates to a muscle stimulating apparatus. Muscle stimulating apparatuses are well known which comprise a plurality of electrodes which are applied to the skin and a pulse source which supplies to them a stream of pulses of suitable frequency, amplitude and waveform to stimulate muscles below the skin for the purposes of toning or exercising them. One such apparatus is the Slendertone Registered Trade Mark . According to the present invention we provide a muscle stimulating apparatus comprising a source of electrical signals a plurality of electrodes adapted to be applied adjacent respective locations on the skin of a person to stimulate underlying muscles and means for energizing said electrodes in response to said electrical signals, the arrangement being such that the signals are applied across the electrodes a pair at a time in a predetermined time sequence. By applying the signals, which are preferably pulses, to the electrodes a pair at a time, so that the signals do not overlap in time, the interaction between the signals to multiple electrodes, which has been a disadvantage of prior apparatuses, is avoided. A convenient way of producing suitable trains of pulses is by time division multiplexing of a single pulse train. One suitable form of the trains of pulses consists of bursts of pulses followed by spaces of lengths approximately equal to the bursts. Preferably the leading edge of the envelope of each burst is rounded so that the burst surges to its maximum value. One way of producing such a waveform with the present apparatus is to have a pulse generator which generates the pulses at a desired frequency e.g. 100 Mn and to amplitude modulate it with the output of a much lower frequency square waveform from an envelope timing generator and having a suitably rounded leading edge.The resulting modulated pulse train is applied via an amplifier buffer to the primary of an output transformer. The output of the higher frequency pulse generator is also connected to a pulse counter and One of N decoder, where N is the desired number of outputs of the apparatus. Associated with the secondary of the output transformer is multiplexing circuitry suitable for deriving N separate pulse streams, One for each set of electrodes. These pulse streams are derived using N electronic switches, preferably opto isolators, each controlled by individual signals of the outputs of the One of N decoder and are delivered to respective output terminals for connection to the body electrodes.In the circuitry associated with the transformer secondary, each set of electrodes may share a common return line and this can include a current limiting device such as a controlled current source to ensure that the maximum current is limited to a desirable and safe level. An apparatus as described above is described in more detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings. The illustrated apparatus has a number of advantages. Because of the time division multiplex method of production of the pulse streams and the inclusion of the current limiting device, the pulses applied to each set of electrodes have a known and limited maximum energy content. The apparatus is incapable of providing peak voltages and currents beyond those supplied by the transformer and current limiting device, regardless of any accidental or deliberate cross connecting of any output electrode groups.Electrical interaction between electrodes of different sets when placed on the skin for the purpose of stimulation cannot occur because the pulse signals to each arrive at the electrodes at different times, therefore the effects of having signals present on all outputs simultaneously, which as mentioned above has caused interaction problems in the past, is eliminated. The above and other features of the invention will be further described by way of non limiting example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIGURE 1 is a functional block diagram of one embodiment of the invention FIGURE 2 shows the waveforms occurring at various points in the circuitry of Figure 1 and Figure 3 shows one particular form of the circuitry of Figure 1. The general construction and operation of the illustrated apparatus should be readily apparent from Figures 1 and 2. Briefly, the apparatus comprises a pulse generator 1 whose output is delivered by a delay circuit which provides a short delay to equalise delay times throughout the circuitry to a mixer 3 where the pulse stream D is amplitude modulated with a much lower frequency pulse waveform B. This waveform B has an approximately 50 percent duty cycle and rounded positivegoing edges and is derived from a lower frequency pulse generator 4 by an envelope shaper 5. The output from mixer 3 is applied to the input of an amplifier and buffer 6 which drives the primary 7 of an output transformer 8. The output of pulse generator 1 is also applied to the input of a pulse counter 9 whose outputs F to J each go high in succession to produce 4 streams of pulses as indicated at F to J in Figure 2 which go high in non overlapping relation to one another and in synchronism with respective ones of 4 successive pulses of the pulse train E. The pulse counter may, for example, comprise a 4 bit recycling counter whose outputs are connected to a One of 4 decoder. Connected in parallel across the secondary 10 of transformer 8 are four potentiometers 11 to 14 associated with respective output terminals W Z to which, in user may be connected one electrode of each of 4 sets of electrodes which may be applied to the body of the user using suitable body pads. The wipers of the potentiometers 11 to 14 are connected to the associated terminals W Z via respective electronically operated switches 15 to 18 which are controlled by the individual ones of the outputs F to J of pulse counter 9. These electronic switches may be of the optoisolator type e.g. having a light emitting diode driven by the associated output of pulse counter 9 and a phototransistor constituting the controlled conduction path.This, of course, serves to ensure that the circuitry connected to the body electrodes floats for isolation purposes. The outputs W Z may share a common return line 19 to the secondary 10 of the transformer and this may include a current limiting device 20 such as a constant current source to keep the pulsed currents at a desired value. In Figure 1 each potentiometer 11 14 is shown connected to its associated output W Z via an amplifier 21 24 and switch 15 18. This arrangement of the amplifiers and switches is intended to be schematic in the corresponding part of Figure 3 the controlled element of each opto isolator is a photo transistor 15 18 which when turned on shunts the collector to emitter circuit of an associated transistor 21 24 which corresponds to the amplifier in Figure 2.These transistors 21 24 are suitably rated to handle the output voltage from transformer 8. Figure 3 shows one possible implementation of the circuitry of Figure 1 using 11556W timers, CD4000 series logic circuitry and opto isolators. By way of example, suitable signal characteristics are as follows Pulse duration as in D.E.W,X,Y,Z from 20 to 200 microseconds Pulse interval as in W.X,Y,Z 12 milliseconds Pulse interval as in E,D 3 milliseconds for 4 output circuit version of the stimulating device or Pulse interval as E,D 1.5 milliseconds for 8 output circuit version of the stimulating device. Delay time E 200 microseconds Pulse train duration as in A1B,C 1 second Pulse train interval as in A,B,C 1.5 second Maximum output voltage 110V into 1 kilohm load Maximum output current 120 milliamps. Other values for the above parameters are, of course, possible although in the illustrated embodiment the pulses applied to the body electrodes are unipolar, the circuitry could be so arranged that the pulses are bipolar.
