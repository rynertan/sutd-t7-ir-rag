# Propylene polymer composition.

## Abstract
A proplyene polymer composition having excellent whit ening resistance, impat resistance, rigidity and flowability. The propylene polymer composition comprises A 100 parts by weight of a propylene polymer or a modified polymer obtained by heat treating the propylene polymer in a organic peroxides and B 0.02 2.0 parts by weight of an ester of an aliphatic saturated monocarboxylic acid and a polyhydic alcohol, and the propylene polymer essentially consists of two particular polymer fractions or three particular polymer fractions polymerized over stereoregular catalysts and com binationed in a specific ratio.
