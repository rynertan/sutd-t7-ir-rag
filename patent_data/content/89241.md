# Non polarized contactless relay.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a non polarized, contactless relay con structed of electronic circuitry devoid of mechanical contacts but capable of performing the same function as a relay with such contacts. The relay includes a transformer 3 , a control circuit 1, 2 for applying an oscillatory signal to the primary winding of the transformer 3 in accordance with a com mand input IN , a rectifying circuit 4 for rectifying A.C. power obtained from the secondary winding of the transfor mer 3 in response to the oscillatory signal applied to the primary winding, a smoothing circuit 5 which smooths the rectified output produced by the rectifying circuit 4 for delivering D.C. power, and switching means 6 composed of a pair of MOS type field effect transistors 6a, 6b driven by the D.C. output of the smoothing circuit 5 . The command input IN , namely 1 or 0 logic, applied to the control circuit 1, 2 results in the supply of the D.C. signal to the MOSFETS 6a, 6b when logical 1 holds, driving the MOSFETS 6a, 6b into conduction to form a closed path between the output terminals A, B of the switching means 6 and, hence, close the relay.
