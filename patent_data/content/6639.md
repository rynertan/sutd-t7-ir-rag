## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTION Crystalline N Formimidoyl Thienamycin.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to crystalline Nformimidoyl thienamycin and a process for its preparation. The antibiotic N formimidoyl thienamycin I is known, see for example, Belgium PatentNo. 848,545 issued May 20, 1977 EMI1.1 The crystalline form of N formimidoyl thienamycin which is disclosed and claimed by this application is prepared from a lyophilized sample of I and is found to have unexpected stability in the solid state over the lyophilized form. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The description and claimed crystalline Nformimidoyl thienamycin exists as a monohydrate and is unambiguously identified by the following parameters of the crystal which were obtained by X ray powder diffraction.

The following specific example illustrates the crystallization. EXAMPLE 1Crystalline N formimidoyl Thienamycin A lyophilized sample of N formimidoyl thienamycin 62 mg is dissolved in 1.0 ml of water and diluted with 5.5 ml of 95 ethanol. The resulting solution is immersed in an ice bath, stirred with a magnetic stirrer and seeded with N formimidoyl thienamycin monohydrate crystals obtained by a procedure described immediately below. After 1 1 2 hours stirring, the crystals are recovered by centrifugation. After decantation, the crystals are washed with 1 ml of ethanol and dried under vacuum at 500C for 1 hour to yield 56 mg of crystallineN formimidoyl thienamycin monohydrate.The seed crystals employed in the above crystallization are prepared by the following procedure A lyophilized sample of N formimidoyl thienamycin 24.5 mg is dissolved in 0.5 ml of water, diluted to 3.0 ml with ethyl alcohol and stored in the freezer 50C . After two weeks, crystals are observed on the walls of the glass tube. N formimidoyl thienamycin is used as an antibiotic, as disclosed in the Belgian Patent 848,545, referred to above. In the treatment of bacterial infections in man, the compound of this invention is administered orally or parenterally, in accordance with conventional procedures for antibiotic administration, in an amount of from about 2 to 600 mg kg day and preferably about 15 to 150 mg kg day in preferably divided dosage, e.g. three to four times a day. They may be administered in dosage units containing, for example 25, 250, 500 or 1000 mg. of active ingredient with suitable physiologically acceptable carriers or excipients. The dosage units are in the form of liquid preparations such as solutions or suspensions or as solids in tablets or capsules.It will, of course, be understood that the optimum dose in any given instance will depend upon the type and severity of infection to be treated, and the smaller doses will be employed for pediatric use, all of such adjustments being within the skill of the practioner in the field. In addition to use alone, a particularly preferred method of using N formimidoyl thienamycin is in combination with a dipeptidase E.C. 3.4.13.11 inhibitor The class of dipeptidase inhibitor compounds can generally be described by the following formula EMI5.1 wherein R2 and R3 are hydrocarbon radicals in the range respectively of 3 10 and 1 15 carbon atoms.In either of these hydrocarbon radicals, a hydrogen may be replaced by halogen or a non terminal methylene may be replaced by oxygen or sulfur, including oxidized forms of the latter. A hydrogen in R3 may also be replaced by a carboxy, alkoxycarbonyl, amido, amidino, cyano, mercapto, and phosphono or amino group. RÃª is preferably a branched or cycloalkyl radical C310 , with a limitation that the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl cannot be tertiary. R1is hydrogen, loweralkyl C1 6 or dialkylaminoalkyl e.g., CH2CH2N C2H5 2, CH2CH CH3 N CH3 2. A particularly preferred sub group of inhibitor 2.compounds are those in which R is 2,2 dimethyl cyclopropyl, and R3 is alkyl of 1 15 carbon atoms, even more preferably R3 is alkyl of 1 5 carbon atoms.The most preferred species of inhibitor presently is that in which R3 is C5 alkyl, R2 is 2,2 dimethylcyclopropyl, and R1 is hydrogen or sodium.This compound is Z 2 2,2 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxamido 2 octenoic acid, or sodium salt. The most preferred administration route is parenteral, and the most preferred dosage form of the sodium Z 2 2, 2 dimethylcyclopropanecarboxamido 2 octenoate with crystalline N formimidoyl thienamycin is 75 or 150 mg of the former and 150 mg of the latter, coadministered by IV sterile aqueous solution injection, 3 or 4 times daily per human.
