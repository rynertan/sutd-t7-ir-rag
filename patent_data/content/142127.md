## Description
This invention relates to a redundancy circuit for a semiconductor memory device and, more particularly, to a redundancy circuit for saving defective memory cells in a semiconductor memory device of the byte configuration type in which data are read out for each bit. The integration density as well as the memory capacity of a semiconductor memory device has been increased year by year. Recently, 256 Kilo bits dynamic random access memories DRAMs and 64 Kilo bits static random access memories SRAM have been put into practice and widely marketed. In manufacturing such memory devices with high integration density and large memory capacity, the problem of the production yield is serious. To cope with this problem, a redundancy technique has been developed. In this approach, an auxiliary memory is formed on the same semiconductor chip with a main memory containing main memory cells in a predetermined memory capacity. If a defective memory cell is contained in the main memory, one of the spare memory cells is used in place of the defective cell. In this way, the production yield in manufacturing the semiconductor memory device is remarkably improved. Actually, however, it is impossible to replace the memory cells one by one. For this reason, in the conventional redundancy circuit, a proper number of row or column spare memory cells are provided. A row or column of the main memory array containing a defective memory cell is replaced by a row or a column in the spare memory arrays. To realize this, a spare row decoder or a spare column decoder associated with the spare memory is programmed so that when a defective cell contained row or column of the main memory is designated, a row or column of the spare memory is correspondingly designated. Fuses are used for program elements, and in programming the decoder, the fuses are selectively burned out by feeding current capable of melting the fuse or by applying a laser beam to the fuse. Fig. 1 shows a conventional redundancy circuit with a program circuit by which fuses are selectively burned out in an electrical manner for the programming. Fig. 2 shows the program circuit of the above redundancy circuit in which N channel MOS transistors are used for the programming elements. In Fig. 1, address signals Ao, In Fig. 2, Ai and For burning out the fuse 29, the programming signal is set at a low level, and the address signal In the redundancy circuit of Fig. 1, if the main memory has no defective memory cell, the spare row enable signal is kept at high level. Therefore, the output of the NOR gate 6 is high in level, and the output of the inverter 7 is low. Only the main decoder 1 operates to select a main row. When the main memory contains a defective memory cell, an address of the row containing the defective memory cell is selected and the fuse 29 is melted for programming. Further, the spare row enable signal is programmed to be in low level and to cause the spare row decoder 3 to operate. When the defective memory cell is designated through such programming, the output of the spare row decoder designated corresponding to the main row containing the defective memory cell is high in level. Then, the spare row 5 applied with the high level output is selected. The output of the NOR gate 6 is low and the output of the inverter 7 is high. As a result, the main decoder 1 is in the non select state. The circuit arrangement of the redundancy circuit as shown in Fig. 1 is easily assembled into a bit configuration type memory device in which data is read out bit by bit. For assembling the redundancy circuit into a byte configuration type memory device in which data is read out byte by byte, the circuit must be designed so that a single or a plurality of the spare rows or columns is switched among a plurality of inputs and outputs. Such a configuration makes the circuit construction complicated, and further deteriorates the write and read out speed performance of the memory device. The byte configuration memory device may be modified so as to have a redundancy function, if the spare row or column is provided for each bit of one byte. Such an approach, however, requires a number of spare rows or columns which is equal to that of bits of one byte. For example, four spare rows or columns are required for four bits eight spare rows or columns for 8 bits. Such a circuit configuration requires a large chip area of the semiconductor memory device. The result is a reduction of the production yield in manufacturing the semiconductor memory devices. Prior art document IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CIRCUITS, vol.

A NMOS 65K static RAM discloses a semiconductor memory device having spare redundant memory, means for accessing spare memory, and a fast word line disable signal to de select the non redundant X decoders. It is the object of the present invention to provide a byte configuration type semiconductor memory device having a redundancy circuit, which is simple in construction, requires a little increase of the chip area, does not deteriorate the memory access speed performance, and enables allotment of addresses which are different from each other to a plurality of main memory sections. To solve the object the present invention provides a semiconductor memory device as stated in claim 1. In the semiconductor memory device according to the embodiment underlying the present invention, two main rows containing the defective memory cells can be saved in each of both memory sections. Therefore, a total of four main rows containing the defective memory cells can be saved in both the memory sections. The number of the saved rows is two times that of the conventional redundancy circuit in which the spare rows are provided for a single memory array, not separated into two sections. The arrangement of the embodiment of the present invention in which the memory array is divided into two sections, and each of the memory sections is associated with the spare rows, is equivalent to an arrangement that each memory section is associated with both the spare row and column. As for the defective cell saving effect, the arrangement of the present invention is inferior to the conventional arrangement in which the spare row is provided for each bit of the byte. However, the circuit arrangement is simpler than that of the conventional one. Thus, the increase of the chip area is minimized. Further, there is no need for switching the spare rows among a plurality of input and output terminals. Therefore, access time to the memory is not damaged. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Reference is made to Fig. 3 illustrating an embodiment of a redundancy circuit of a semiconductor memory device according to the present invention. In the embodiment, the redundancy circuit according to the present invention is applied to a byte configuration type static random access memory SRAM of 8 Kilo words 8 bits. As shown, the rows and columns of the memory matrix contain each 256 memory cells. The memory cell array comprises two sections 31 and 32 divided in the column direction. Each section 31 or 32 further consists of 8 units 16 column lines each containing 4096 cells. The number of units is selected corresponding to 8 bits constituting one byte. The sections 31 and 32 contain main row decoders 33 and 34 located at the center thereof. The main row decoders 33 and 34 can each select a row, independently of the main memory in each of the cell sections 31 and 32. A column decoder 35 is commonly provided for all of the units. The column decoder 35 receives address signals Ao, In Fig. 3, only the transfer gates 39 and 40 for the fifth bit are illustrated for simplicity. The memory cell sections 31 and 32 have pairs of spare rows 41 and 42, and 43 and 44, respectively. The spare rows 41, 42, 43 and 44 each comprise a plurality of spare cells arranged in the row direction. The main row decoders 33 and 34 receive the address signals A4 and Fig. 4 shows a portion of the circuit shown in Fig. 3, which includes the spare row decoders 45 48 and the generation circuits 49 and 50. Particularly, the spare row decoder 45 and the generation circuit 49 are illustrated in detail. The decoders 46 48 each have the same circuit arrangement as that of the decoder 45. The generation circuit 50 has the same circuit arrangement as that of the main decoder disable signal generation circuit 49. The spare row decoder 45 contains a plurality of fuses 51 as program elements. The fuses 51 are burned out by applying a laser beam to them. In the decoder transistor section 52 of the decoder 45, transistors T1A T16A and T17 are all of the N channel enhancement type. The gates of those transistors T1A T16A are connected to the first ends of fuses 51, respectively. The second ends of these fuses are connected to the address signals A5, The operation of the Fig. 4 circuit will be given. When the spare row decoder 45, for example, is not programmed, that is, none of the fuses are burned out, the address signals A5, The main decoder disable signal generation circuit 49 is low in level at the output when the outputs of the spare row decoders 45 and 46 are both low in level. When the output signal of either of the decoders 45 and 46 is high, its output is high. This high level output is a disable signal for the main row decoder 33 and is applied to the gate of the driver transistor not shown in the decoder 33. It is assumed that, in the memory device of Fig. 3, one defective memory cell is detected in the memory section 31. In this case, the address of the row containing the defective memory cell is programmed for the spare row decoder 45, for example. This programming is made in such a manner that the programming fuses of the decoder 45 are selectively burned out corresponding to the address of the row. With such a programming, when the main row containing the defective memory cell is designated, the spare decoder 45 corresponding to the main row is selected and the output of the decoder 45 is high in level. Then, the output signal of the main decoder disenable signal generation circuit 49 is at a high level or a disenable level. All of the main row decoders in the memory section 31 are in a non select condition. In other words, the main row decoder is not selected, and only the spare row decoder 45 is selected. This indicates that the main row containing the defective memory cell is replaced with the spare row 41 by the decoder 45. If the memory section 31 contains another main row containing a defective memory cell, the spare row decoder 46 is programmed corresponding to an address of the other row, as in the case of the decoder 45, and then the defective cell contained main row is replaced by the spare row 42. This is correspondingly applied for the memory section 31. Also in the memory section 32, the spare row decoders 47 and 48 are appropriately programmed and the two main rows containing the defective memory cells are replaced by the spare rows 43 and 44. In the decoders 45 to 48, the fuses are burned out by a laser beam, but may be burned out electrically, viz., by feeding current thereinto, if necessary. Further, the memory array may be divided into two or more sections, if necessary. However, when the number of the divided sections is increased, the number of the row decoders is correspondingly increased. In this respect, it is not suggestible to use three or more divided memory sections. The division of the two sections as in the above mentioned embodiment provides a satisfactory effect in practical use, and is simple in construction. Additionally, it is evident that the present invention is applicable not only for SRAMs, but also for DRAM and PROMs.
