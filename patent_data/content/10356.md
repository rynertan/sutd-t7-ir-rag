# Method and apparatus for spreading cellular material such as fibrillated polypropylene nets.

## Abstract
A cellular mat, for example of fibrillated polypropylene, is made by laterally spreading a relatively thin filamentary strip 6 . The spreading is achieved by passing the strip through an expansion device 11 with upper and lower clamping mem bers 12 and 13 . Jet nozzles 22 in clamping member 12 direct water laterally outwardly to spread the strip. The mat produced is used as a reinforcement for cement or concrete.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A method of manufacturing a cellular mat which comprises taking a strip 6 of cellular material and causing fluid to flow laterally outwardly from a position on the strip, the moving fluid impinging on the interstices of the strip laterally to expand the strip into a mat. 2. A method as claimed in Claim 1 wherein the strip is confined between clamping members 12 and 13 and fluid is injected into the space 18 between the members to flow laterally outwardly to expand the strip. 3. A method as claimed in either Claim 1 orClaim 2 which is a continuous method the strip being dispersed from a reel and the mat being wound onto a roller 7. 4. A method as claimed in any of the preceding claims wherein the fluid is water. 5. A method as claimed in any of the preceding claims wherein the cellular material is fibrillated polypropylene and the mat is used for reinforcing cement or concrete. 6. Apparatus for carrying out a method as claimed in Claim 1 comprising upper and lower clamping members 12 and 13 and jet nozzles 22 in at least one of the clamping members through which the fluid is injected to flow laterally outwardly from a central position.

## Description
This invention relates to the lateral expansion of cellular material. The invention has particular but not exclusive application to the production of a cellular mat of fibrillated polypropylene for use as a reinforcement in cement or concrete.Fibrillated polypropylene is commercially obtainable as a relatively narrow tape or strip which has to be laterally expanded to provide a useful reinforcement mat. In accordance with the present invention the width of a piece of cellular material is increased by the lateral flow of fluid contacting the piece. Preferably the piece is confined between clamping members and fluid Injected into the confined space between the members so as to flow outwardly in each lateral direction from the longitudInal centre of the piece. The process in accordance with the present invention is preferably a continuous process involving dispensing cellular strip material continuously, for example from a reel and passing the strip through an expansion device to produce a relatively wide mat. An expansion device in accordance with the invention comprises upper and lower clamping members and nozzles in at least one of the members through alhich fluid can be injected so as to flow laterally outwardly from the longitudinal centre of the pieces. The invention will now be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein Figure 1 is a perspective view of an apparatus in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is a plan view of the lower part of the upper member of a clamping device in the apparatus of Figure 1 and Figure 3 is a sectional view on an enlarged scale of part of the clamping device. Referring now to Figure 1 of the draw ings the apparatus shown comprises a support frame 1 having longitudinal members 2 and cross members 3. Cellular material moves through the device from rear to front in the direction of the arrow a . On the rearmost of the cross members 3 there is mounted on a bracket 4 and spindle 5 a reel of of cellular strip material 6, for example fibrillated polypropylene. The material 6 is wound as a laterally expanded mat with enlarged interstices onto a roller 7 at the front end of the frame 1, the roller 7 being carried on an axle 8 with a handle crank 9 at one end.The axle 8 is supported on uprights 10. in use when the handle 9 is turned counterclockwise the strip of material 6 is drawn off the reel and through an expansion device II to be converted to the relatively wide mat to be wound on roller 7. The expansion device II comprises upper and lower members 12 and 13. Upper and lower clasping bars 15 and 16 are secured together in clasping relationship by threaded members 17 so as to be adjustable to bear upon material 6 passing through the expansion device and to define a confined space 18 see Figure 3 . As can be seen in Figure 3 the upper clamping member comprises upper and lower contacting plates 19 and 20. An array of elongate channels 21 as shown in Figure 2 is provided in the lower plate 20 each channel comrmilicating by a jet 22 inclined downwardly and laterally outwardly from the longitudinal centre with the confined space 18. Consideration of Figures 2 and 3 shows how the channels 21 and jets 22 are so disposed and arranged as to cause laterally outward flow of liquid discharged into the channels in the directions b and c . Immediately above each channel 21 in the upper plate 19 is screwed a connecting nozzle 23 which in turn is connected to an individual pipe 24 to a manifold 25 with a plurality of control taps 26. In use a liquid, conveniently water, is caused to flow under moderate pressure in the direction of arrow b into the manifold 25, through pipes 24 and jets 23 into channels 21 and then through jets 22 into space 18. The water under pressure then flows laterally outwardly in the direction of arrows b and c as indicated in Figure 3. The relatively narrow strip part 6 moving through the expansion device on entry has the laterally outwardly moving liquid impinging on the interstices of the netting thereby exerting forces sufficient to expand the relatively narrow strip entering the device into the relatively wide matting leaving the device. A plurality of strips 6 can be passed, one on top of another, through the apparatus. A proposed modification has an expansion device comprising a multi layer assembly of clamping mergers whereby more than one strip to be laterally expanded can be advanced simultaneously. As mentioned above the expanded matting finds use for the reinforcement of cement or concrete and a continuous process is envisaged whereby instead of the expanded mat being reeled onto a member such as the roller 17 it is guided into and through a slurry of cement or concrete.
