# Improved water reducible modified polyester resin.

## Abstract
Water reducible modified polyester resins containing from 20 to 50 by weight, based on total solids weight, of a mixture of hexamethoxymethyl melamine and methylated melamine formaldehyde in a weight ratio of from 2 to 1 to 1 to 2. The mixture is preferably from 25 to 35 of the resin based on total solids weight and the weight ratio of hexamethoxymethyl melamine to methylated melamine formaldelhyde is preferably about 1 to 1. The mixture should be at least 75 by weight of any melamine resin present.
