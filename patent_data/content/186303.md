# Electrophotographic imaging members.

## Abstract
An electrophotographic imaging member is disclosed comprising a charge generation layer and a charge transport layer, the transport layer comprising an aromatic amine charge transport molecule in a continuous polymeric binder phase, and a chemical stabilizer of certain nitrone, isobenzo furan, hydroxyaromatic compounds and mixtures therof. An electrophotographic imaging process using this member is also described.
