# Fixture and method for shanking rock bits.

## Abstract
A method for shanking a rock bit 15 utilizing a shank locator 21 and a cone locator 23 , each with tapered surfaces to engage respectively the tail stock of a lathe and the cones 17 of a rock bit 15 , to accurately align the body and the cones 17 of the bit 15 concentric with the design centerline of the bit. The lathe and cone locators each have interior conical surfaces to assure accurate, coaxial align ment of the shank end 13 and the cone end of the bit 15 . A compensating chuck is used to grip the cone end of the bit body and firmly hold the normally uneven surfaces while the threads are being machined.
