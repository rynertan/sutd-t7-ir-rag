# Two component coating for rusty steels.

## Abstract
A coating composition suitable for rusty steel comprises separate components A and B. Component A contains a polyglycidyl ether of a bisphe nol having an epoxy equivalent weight between about 170 and about 200 diluted with between about 10 weight percent and about 20 weight percent of butyl glycidyl ether an organic thixotropic agent a liquid polyglycidyl ether of a bisphenol having an epoxy equivalent weight between about 170 and about 210 a coumarone indene resin having a softening point between about 40 F. and about 60 F. a urea formaldehyde resin leafing aluminum paste and 2 nitropropane. Component B contains a polyamide having a base number between about 300 and about 360 N oleyl 1,3 propylenediamine oleate a coumarone indene resin having a softening point between about 40 F. and about 60 F. microcrystalline silica and 2,4,6 tris dimethylaminomethyl phenol. Components A and B are mixed and thinned with an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent immediately prior to applica tion.
