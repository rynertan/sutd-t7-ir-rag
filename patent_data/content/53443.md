# DAVITS

## Abstract
A davit comprises a support pillar 10 an arm 11 extending outwardly from the pillar 10 and means to suspend a dinghy from the arm 11 . A crank handle 12 for raising and lowering the dinghy is mounted on a projection 13 such that when the crank handle is rotated it does not project substantially into the area bounded by the pillar 10 and the arm 11 , thus en abling the widest possible dinghy to be accomodated without the handle 12 fouling on the dinghy. A gun whale block 28 fixed to the dinghy gunwhale 26 to interengage with the arm 11 and restrict movement of the stowed dinghy in the direction of its fore and aft axis. Webbing 15 is preferably used to suspend the dinghy and the webbing may pass over a roller which also supports an extension member 19 of the arm 11 .
