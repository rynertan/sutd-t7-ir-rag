# Clear stable alcohol gasoline motor fuel.

## Abstract
A hazy or potentially hazy water saturated alcohol gasoline blend can be converted into a clear, stable gasoline composition having an improved octane rating by the addition of an aminated polyisopropoxylated polyethoxylated alkylphenol having the formula CHEM wherein R is C5 C30 alkyl, x is 1 to 20, and y is 1 to 10, to a mixture of hydrocarbon in the gasoline boiling range, from 2.0 to 12.0 volume percent of methanol, from 2.0 to 10.0 volume percent of a cosolvent C2 C5 aliphatic alcohol and from 0.1 to 0.5 volume percent of water.
