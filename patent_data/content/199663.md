## Description
Description Method of Electrodepositing Cationic Resin Compositions Without The Need For Volatile Organic Coalescent SolventsTechnical Field The field of art to which this invention pertains is epoxy resins, and, more specifically, epoxy resin compositions containing crosslinking agents for use in cathodic electrocoat processes.Background Art Cathodic electrodepositable resin compositions are well known in the art. Similarly, aqueous electrodeposition baths and processes for coating objects in aqueous electrodeposition baths containing cathodic electrodepositable resin compositions are well known in the art. The cathodic electrodepositable resin compositions conventionally used are epoxy amine adducts mixed with a crosslinking agent and salted with an acid to form an aqueous principal emulsion. The aqueous principal emulsion is typically mixed at the coating site with a pigment paste, water, coalescent solvents, and other additives known in the art to form an aqueous electrodeposition bath. The bath is usually contained in an electrically insulated tank containing an anode. The object to be coated typically comprises an electrically conductive material.The object is usually connected to a direct current circuit to act as a cathode. When the object is immersed in the tank, flow of electricity across the object causes the resin and crosslinking emulsion as well as the pigment paste to be deposited on the surface of the object. As previously mentioned, cathodic electrodepositable amine containing epoxy resin compositions are well known in the art, similarly, processes for the deposition of these resins and aqueous electrodeposition baths are similarly well known in the art. These resins, baths, and processes are disclosed in U. S. Patent Nos. 3,984,299, 3,468,779, 4,116,900, 4,093,594, 4,137,140, 4,104,147, 4,225,478, 4,419,467, and 4,432,850, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference. It is known in the art that it is necessary to include coalescent solvents in a cathodic electrodeposition coating bath. Without these coalescent solvents, the films which are produced are not smooth. It is critical to have smooth coatings since any imperfections in the electrocoat will show up when a topcoat is applied. The coalescent solvents typically used are those conventional in this art such as ethylene glycol monohexyl ether, propylene glycol monophenyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether diethyleneglycol monobutyl ether, ethanol, isopropanol, etc. The coalescent solvents are typically present in the principal emulsion supplied to the user in a concentration of about 1.0 wt. to about 3.0 wt. of the weight of the principal emulsion at approximately 36 solids.The coalescent solvents are typically present in the coating bath in the range of about 1.0 wt. to about 2.0 wt. of the total bath.It is typically necessary during the operation of the coating bath for the operator to increase the volatile organic content of the coating bath by adding additional coalescent solvent to produce an electrocoat which is smooth. In addition to the coalescent solvents having an effect on the smoothness of the deposited film, it is also known that in order to get high build films, that is, films with a thickness of about 1.0 to about 1.4 mils, coalescent solvents are required. There is a constant search in the coatings industry for low VOC volatile organic content coatings. This is particularly true in high volume, high use production operations such as automobile manufacturing. It is desirable to eliminate the VOC of coatings such as electrodeposited cationic coatings in order to meet government emission regulations and protect the safety and health of the workers. Accordingly what is needed in this art is an electrodeposition bath and a method of cat ionic electrodeposition in which the use of coalescent solvents in a cathodic electrodeposition bath is substantially reduced or eliminated.Disclosure of the Invention It has now been found, surprisingly and unexpectedly, that by incorporating certain crosslinking agents into the principal electrodepositable resin emulsion, smooth high film build cathodic electrodeposited coatings can be produced without using coalescent solvents in the electrodeposition bath. A method of coating articles with a film forming resin using a cathodic electrodeposition process is disclosed wherein a cathodic electrodepositable amine containing epoxide resin is mixed with a crosslinking agent, salted with an acid to form an aqueous principal emulsion, the emulsion is mixed with a pigment paste and water to form an aqueous coating bath, the bath is contained in an electrically insulated tank containing an anode, an electrically conductive article is connected to a D.C.circuit to act as a cathode, the article is immersed in the bath and a current is passed across the article resulting the deposition of a film of the resin and crosslinking agent and pigment paste on the surfaces of the article, and then the article is removed from the bath and the coating is cured, the improvement comprising using as the crosslinking agent a blocked polyisocyanate crosslinking agent comprising the reaction product of a polyetherpolyol,a multi functional isocyanate, and a blocking agent, thereby producing smooth, flexible high build films and substantially reducing or eliminating the need for organic coalescent solvents. Another aspect of this invention is a coated article manufactured by the above mentioned method. Another aspect of this invention is an improved aqueous cathodic electrodeposition coating bath, wherein the coating bath comprises an acid salted amine containing epoxide resin, a crosslinking agent, pigment paste, and water. The improvement comprises the use of a crosslinking agent comprising the reaction product of polyetherpolyol, a multifunctional isocyanate, and a blocking agent, thereby producing smooth, flexible, high build electrodeposited films and substantially eliminating or reducing the need for organic coalescent solvents. The use of the crosslinking agents of the present invention surprisingly and unexpectedly results in the elimination of previously required organic coalescent solvents in the coating bath. It is surprising and unexpected that the coating bath and method of the present invention will produce coated articles having smooth, high build, flexible films without using volatile organic coalescent solvents. The foregoing, and other features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the following description.Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention The blocked polyisocyanate crosslinking agents of the present invention are made by reacting a multifunctional isocyanate i.e., polyisocyanate with a polyetherpolyol.

Pigment is typically added to the electrodeposition bath in paste form, i.e., predispersed in a composition comprising pigment, amine containing epoxy resin, and surfactants. Electrodeposition baths typically contain coalescent solvents which are water soluble or partially water soluble organic solvents for the resinous vehicles used in the practice of this invention. The coalescent solvents used in the practice of this invention are those typically used and known in the art. Examples of such volatile organic coalescent solvents include monomethyl ether ethylene glycol, monoethyl ether ethylene glycol, monobutylether, diethylene glycol monobutylether, ethanol, isopropanol, n butenol, etc. Sufficient amounts of coupling solvent are used so that a good emulsion resulting in a smooth deposited film is produced. The use of the crosslinking agents of the present invention substantially reduces or completely eliminates the need for coalescent solvents. When coalescent solvents are used, the total amounts used in the coating bath will be typically less than about 0.5 wt. based on 20 to 25 wt. solids for the bath , and preferably less than about 0.3 wt. . The amounts of coalescent solvents present in a principal aqueous emulsion will typically be less than about 0.5 wt. based on 36 wt. solids for the emulsion and preferably less than 0.3 wt. . The electrodeposition process typically takes place in an electrically insulated tank containing an electrically conductive anode which is attached to a direct current source. The size of the tank will depend on the size of the article to be coated.Typically, the tank is constructed of stainless steel or mild steel lined with a dielectric coating such as epoxy impregnated fiberglass or polypropylene. The electrodepositable cathodic resinous coating compositions of this invention are typically used to coat articles such as automobile or truck bodies. Ita typical size of an electrodeposition bath tank use for this purpose is about 60,000 gallons to about 120,000 gallons. Typically, the article to be coated is connected to the direct current circuit so that the conductive object acts as the cathode. When the article is immersed in the coating bath, flow of electrons frfom the cathode to the anode, that is, conventional current flow from the anode to the cathode, results in the particles of the dispersed cationic electrodepositable resin composition being deposited on the surfaces of the article. The particles of the dispersed resin composition are positively charged and are therefore attracted to the negative cathodic surface of the object to be coated.The thickness of coating deposited upon the object during its residence in the electric cathodic coating bath is a function of the cathodic electrodepositable resin composition, the voltage across the article, the current flux, the pH of the coating bath, the conductivity, the residence time, etc. Sufficient voltage will be applied to the coated article for a sufficient time to obtain a coating of sufficient thickness Typically, the voltage applied across the coated article is about 50 volts to about 500 volts, more typically about 200 to about 350 volts, and preferably about 225 volts to about 300 volts. The current density is typically about 0.5 ampere per sq. ft. to about 30 amperes per sq. ft., more typically about one ampere per sq. ft.to about 25 amperes per sq. ft., and preferably about one ampere per sq. ft. The article to be coated typically remains in the coating bath for a sufficient period of time to produce a coating or film of sufficient thickness, having sufficient resistance to corrosion and flexibility. The residence time or holding time is typically about 1 minute to about 3 minutes, more typically about 1 minute to about 2 1 2 minutes, and preferably about 2 minutes. The pH of the coating bath is sufficient to produce a coating which will not rupture under the applied voltage. That is, sufficient pH to maintain the stability of the coating bath so that the resin does not kick out of the dispersed state and to control the conductivity of the bath. Typically, the pH is about 4 to about 7 more typically about 5 to about 6.8, and preferably about 6 to about 6.5. The conductivity of the coating bath will be sufficient to produce a coated film of sufficient thickness. Typically the conductivity will be about 800 micro mhos to about 3,000 micro mhos, more typically about 800 micro mhos to about 2,200 micro mhos, and preferably about 900 micro mhos to about 1,800 micro mhos. The desirable coating thicknesses are sufficient to provide resistance to corrosion while having adequate flexibility. Typically, the film thicknesses of the coated objects of this invention will be about 0.4 mil to about 1.8 mils, more typically about 0.6 mil to about 1.6 mils, and preferably about 1.2 mils to about 1.4 mils. The term high film build is defined to mean a film thickness greater than 1.0 mils. The temperature of the coating bath is prefefibBlsy maintained through cooling at a temperature less than about 86 F. When the desired thickness of the coating has been achieved the coated object is removed from the electrodeposition bath and cured. Typically, the electrodeposited coatings are cured in a conventiom convection oven at a sufficient temperature for a sufficient length of time to unblock the blocked crosslinking agents and allow for crosslinking of the electrodepositable resin compositions. Typically, the coated articles will be baked at a temperature of about 2000F to about 6000F, more typically about 2500F to about 3750 F, and preferably about 2950F to about 3250F. The coated articles will be baked for a time period of about 10 minutes to about 40 minutes, more typically about ten minutes to about 35 minutes, and preferably about 15 minutes to about 30 minutes. It is contemplated that the coated articles of the present invention may also be cured by using radiation, vapor curing, contact with heat transfer fluids and equivalent methods. The smoothness of the cured coating is a function of the flow of the deposited coating composition.Flow is defined as the tendency of the electrodeposited coating composition to liquify during the curing operation and form a smooth cohesive film over the surface of a coated article prior to the onset crosslinking. Flow is related to the plasticizing effect of coalescent solvents. Typically the coated articles of this invention will comprise conductive substrates such as metal, including steel, aluminum, copper, etc., however, any conductive substrate having a conductivity similar to the aforementioned metals may be used. The articles to be coated may comprise any shape so long as all surfaces can be wetted by the electrodeposition bath.The characteristics of the article to be coated which have an effect on the coating include the shape of the article, the capacity of the surfaces to be wetted by the coating solution, and the degree of shielding from the anode. Shielding is defined as the degree of interference with the electromotive field produced between the cathode and the anode, thereby preventing the coating composition from being deposited in those shielded areas. A measure of the ability of the coating bath to coat remote areas of the object is throwpower. Throwpower is a function of the electrical configuration of the anode and cathode as well as the conductivity of the electrodeposition bath. The coatings of the coated articles of this invention exhibit smoothness, gloss, flexibility, high film build, durability, and resistance to corrosion. Smoothness and gloss are related to the flow of the electrodeposited cathodic resin.Durability, high film build flexibility and resistance to corrosion are related to the chemical nature of the electrodeposited cathodic resin as well as the smoothness of the deposited coating. These coating compositions readily accept an automotive prier overcoat. It should be noted that the articles which are coated by the coating compositios of this invention are typically automobile bodies which have been pretreated to remove impurities and contaminants in Åa phosphatizing bath.
