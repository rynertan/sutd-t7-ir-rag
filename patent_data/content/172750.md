## Abstract
A semisintered polytetrafluoroethylene article which is prepared by heating at least a part of an unsintered polytetrafluoroethylene article at a temperature of at least the melting point of the sintered polymer, the heated part of the article having an endothermic curve at a temperature of 345 5 DEG C on a crystalline melting chart measured with a differential scanning calorimeter and a crystalline conversion of from 0.10 to 0.85 defined by heat of fusion of the unsintered, semisintered and sintered polymers, and the crystallinity of the heated portion of the semisintered article measured by X ray diffraction being from 78 to 95 .
