## Abstract
A process for producing resin comprising the reaction product of a rubbery polymer with one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers comprising the steps of a introducing a mixture of the rubbery polymerand one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers into a feed sec tion of a screw extruder b polymerizing the monomers with the rubbery polymer in one or more additional reaction sections of the extruder, each section containing means to remove the heat of reaction to control the temperature therein c extruding the co polymer formed at its melt tempera ture through a die head to produce the resin. The product has an unexpectedly high impact resistance. In a representative example, the rubbery polymer is acrylonit rile butadiene and the monomers are made up of a mixture of acrylonitrile and methyl acrylate.
