# Sandwich glass.

## Abstract
A sandwich glass comprising glass plates and an intermediate layer interposed therebetween is disclosed. The intermediate layer may be formed by crosslinking a resin composition comprising an ethylene vinyl acetate copolym er and an organic peroxide under heating of the resin composition above the melting point of the copolymer. Alternatively, the intermediate layer may be formed by photocrosslinking a resin composition comprising an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer and a photosensitizer under light irradiation during or after heating of the resin composition above the melting point of the copolymer.
