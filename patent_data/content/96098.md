## Description
Title Control means for an electrically powered vehicle The present invention relates to control means for controlling the operation of an electrically powered vehicle. The invention has particular, but not exclusive, application to the control of an electrically powered wheelchair for use by invalids, of the type which is adapted to be controlled by an attendant walking behind the wheelchair, such a wheelchair is hereinafter referred to as an attendant controlled wheelchair . The control means of the present invention is particularly adapted for use with electrically powered vehicles in which the steering of the vehicle is caused by, or assisted by supplying different amounts of power to driven wheels on respective sides of the vehicle. In the case of an electrically powered vehicle having a driven wheel on each side, each such driven wheel being supplied with power by a respective electrical motor, if only one motor is supplied with power the vehicle will tend to turn in a direction away from the side of the powered motor. For example, if a powered wheel on the left hand side of the vehicle is unenergised and a powered wheel on the right hand side is energised, the vehicle will tend to turn in an anti clockwise direction. It is an object of the present invention to provide improved control means in or for an electrically powered vehicle. According to one aspect of the present invention, we provide control means in pr for an electrically powered vehicle, said control means being characterised in that an elongate manually operable member is provided and is adapted for mounting on the vehicle for at least limited rotational movement about a first axis aligned with its longitudinal axis in a first rotational direction from an at rest position to influence electrical energy supplied to a motor or motors adapted to motivate the vehicle, to cause the vehicle to turn in one direction, and in a second opposite rotational direction from said at rest position, to influence the electrical energy supplied to the motor or motors to cause the vehicle to turn in the opposite direction. The manually operable member may be of tube like configuration, and conveniently is of twist grip form. Preferably said manually operable member is biased into said at rest position by gravity or by resilient means, or by both. Preferably speed control means are provided and adapted for mounting so as to be operable in association with said manually operable member in a manner such that said speed control means and said manually operable member may be operated together. Preferably said speed control means is mounted for pivotal movement relative to said manually operable member. Preferably said manually operable member has pivotallymounted thereon speed control means, said speed control means being adapted for pivotal movement from an at rest position in which no power is supplied to the motors, to an operative position in which power is supplied to the motors, there being a differential in the power supplied to the motors on movement of said manually operable member in either rotational direction from its at rest position. Preferably said manually operable member is rotational about an axis which is approximately parallel to or slightly inclined to the ground on which the vehicle is supported. Such an axis will hereinafter be referred to as generally horizontal . The manually operable member is preferably a tubelike part co axially mounted on a further tube like part, said rotational movement being provided about the respective longitudinal axes of said tube like parts.Conveniently, said manually operable member is of twistgrip form. Said means for biasing the manually operable member to its at rest position may be provided internally of the manually operable member and can conveniently comprise co operating cam parts, one cam being associated with the manually operable member, the other with the further tube like part, the arrangement being such that movement of the manually operable member from its at rest position causes movement of one of said cam parts axially along said rotational axis, such axial movement being adapted to cause compression of a resilient means such as a helical spring. Preferably said speed control means is adapted to cause operation of a plurality of switch means, which switch means cause the completion of a circuit whereby electrical energy is supplied to the motors, or is disconnected therefrom, as the case may be, operation of said manually operable member from its at rest position influencing the operation of said switch means in a manner to cause more electrical energy to be supplied to a motor or motors driving one side of the vehicle than the other. According to another aspect of the present invention, we provide an electrically powered wheelchair for use by invalids having at least one driven wheel on each side of the vehicle, each driven wheel being provided with and driven by a respective motor characterised in that control means are provided comprising an elongate manually operable member mounted for at least limited rotational movement about its longitudinal axis from an at rest position in a first direction, whereby one motor is supplied with more electrical energy than the other, and in a second rotational direction from said at rest position, in which position said other motor is supplied with more electrical energy than said one motor. The wheelchair may be an attendant controlled wheel chair, said wheelchair including a pair of elongate handles extending from the rear of the wheelchair in a manner such that an attendant can hold onto the wheelchair, characterised in that one of said elongate handles is mounted for at least limited rotation about its longitudinal axis from an at rests position, in a first rotational direction to enable more power to be supplied to one motor than the other to cause the wheelchair to turn in one direction, and in the opposite rotational direction from its at rest position to enable more power to be supplied to the other of the motors, to cause said wheelchair to turn in the other direction. The invention will now be described in more detail by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein FIGURE 1 is a perspective view of a wheelchair for use by invalids FIGURE 2 is a view, partly in section, of the control means FIGURE 3 is another view of the control means shown in Figure 2 t FIGURE 4 shows different views of one Of the cam parts of the biasing means FIGURE 5 shows views of the other of the osm parts of the biasing means FIGURE 6 shows views of an end part of the control means. Referring first to Figure 1, the wheelchair illustrated comprises a frame construction which includes a pair of side frames 10 and ll, each of the frames 10 and 11 including a back upright member 12 of tubular construction, a front upright member 13 also of tubular construction and a pair of tubular members 14 and 15 interconnecting the front and back members 12. Three linkages 16, only one of which is shown, interconnect the frame assemblies 10 and 11. Each link 16 includes a pair of pivotally connected links which can be moved through an overcentre position to the position shown in Figure 1 in which they serve to maintain the side frames 10 and 11 in spaced relationship. An arm rest 19 having a pad 20 is attached to each of the side frames 10 and 11. A sheet 21 of flexible material is secured between the back members 12 and the side frames to form a back rest. A further sheet 22 of flexible material is secured between the upper tubular members 14 to provide the seat portion of the chair and an additional sheet 23 also of flexible material is secured between the lower tubular members 15 to provide a parcel shelf. Footrests 24 are connected by clips 25 to support members 26 which are connected to the frame members 13 of the side frames 10 and 11. The front wheels of the wheelchair comprise a pair of castor wheels 29 pivotally secured at the lower ends of the tubular front members 13. The rear wheels of the wheelchair comprise a pair of driving wheels 31, only one of which is shown, mounted at the rear of the chair. The wheels can have either pneumatic tyres or solid rubber tyres. The driving wheels 31 are driven by respective electric motors 32L and 32R which may be of a permanent magnet type and mounted relative to the wheel as described and claimed inBritish Patent Specification 1,198,905. Extending from the rear of the wheelchair are a pair of handles 33 by means of which the wheelchair can be controlled by an attendant walking behind the wheelchair.Each of the handles 33 have a grip 34. Secured to one of the uprights 12 there is a control box 37. The control box 37 is provided with an on of f switch 38. The control box 37 is connected to batteries 35 and motors 32 through cables 39 and 40. The handle 33 connected to the control box 37 will now be described in more detail with reference to Figures 2 and 3. The control means comprises an elongate tube like member 35 which is mounted co axially on the handle 33 in a manner such that limited relative rotational movement between the tube like part 35 and the further tube like handle part 33 may take place about axis 41. The control member 35 is biased to an at rest position by biasing means generally indicated at 42, which biasing means comprises a first cam part 43 rotationally fixed but axially movable relative to the member 35, and a second cam part 44 which is both axially and rotationally fixed in the further tube like handle part 33. The control member 35 is secured to the handle 33 by means of threaded fastener 45, the head of which engages an end plug 46 secured to the end of the tube like part forming the control member 35. The threaded part of the fastener 45 engages the second cam part 44. The first cam part is illustrated more clearly inFigure 4 and has a pair of flat surfaces 47 which can slide over flat surfaces 48 provided on the end cap 46 and a V shaped cam surface 49. The second cam part as shown in Figure 5 has a cylindrical surface 50 by means of which it is secured in the tube like handle part 33 and a V 9haped cam face 51.A through bore 52 is provided into which a fastener 45 passes and threadedly engages the cylindrical surface thereof. A helical spring 53 is provided and which acts between the first cam part 43 and the end cap 46 to cause the first cam part 43 to be positioned relative to the second cam part 44 as shown in Figure 2, and biassing the cam part 43 against any movement away from that position. Any rotational movement of the control member 35 relative to the tube like handle part 33 about the axis 41 will cause rotational movement between the cam parts 43 and 44 which in turn will cause axial movement between the cam parts 43 and 44 thus compressing the helical spring 53. When the surfaces 54 of the first cam part abut the surfaces 55 of the end cap, any further rotation in that direction will be prevented. The assembly thus allows for limited rotational movement from the at rest position in either rotational direction. Pivotally mounted on the control member 35 about pivotal axis 60 is a lever 61 having an on position shown in bold outline and an off position shown in dotted outline. Biasing means may be provided to bias the lever 61 to its off position, such biasing means may comprise the weight distribution of the lever itself whereby, unless influenced by external forces other than gravity, it will take up the position shown in dotted outline. Resilient bearing means such as a spring may also or alternatively be provided. Connected to the lever 61 is an operating plate 62.The operating plate 62 is adapted when the lever 61 is in its ton position to cause operation of microswitches 63 and 64, the arrangement being such that as the lever 61 is brought nearer to the control member 35 i.e. is squeezed , the operating plate 62 presses down on the wheels carrying plungers 65 and 66 of respective microswitches 63 and 64. The wheels provided on plungers 65 and 66 assist in the smooth operation of the control means but are not essential to the operation thereof. Pressing down the operating plungers 65 and 66 switch on microswitchs 63 and 64 and enable power to be supplied to the two motors 32L and 32R thus causing the wheelchair to move in a forward straight ahead direction. The operating plate 62 is connected to the lever 61 by a fastener 56. If the control member 35 is rotated in a clockwise direction while the lever 61 is depressed to cause movement of the wheelchair, the plate 62 will be rotated about the longitudinal pivotal axis of the control member 35 and the operating plunger 65 of microswitch 63 is still depressed or possibly depressed even further while the operating plunger 66 of microawitch 64 is no longer depressed or is depressed to a lesser extent. If the microswitch 64 is connected to the right hand motor and the microswitch 63 is connected to the lefthand motor, and they operate to either interrupt or connect the power supplied to said motor, then clockwise rotation of the operating member 35 wil cause the wheelchair to turn to the right and similarly anti clockwise rotation of the operating member 35 will have the effect of maintaining pressure on the plunger 66 or increasing the pressure and depressing the plunger further while decreasing the pressure on plunger 65 or removing the plate 62 completely out of contact therefrom, thus providing greater power to the motor 32R and turning the vehicle to the left. The control box 37 is shown as being connected to the upright 12 by means of a plate 70 by means of fasteners 71 and 72. However it is envisaged that it may be placed at any other suitable alternative position. It is not essential that the control box is placed in proximity to the control member 35 since the microswitches or other switch means, whether mechanical or electronic, be operated by remote control, for example by means of a Bowden cable in response to operation of the control member 35 and lever 61. It is further envisaged that the control member 35 could rotate and cause rotation of the spindle of a variable resistor which in turn would alter the distribution of power supplied to the motors 32L and 32R on respective sides of the wheelchair through an electronic control circuit. Similarly, the control lever 61 could also cause operation of one or more variable resistors to cause power to be supplied to the motors in an infinitely variable manner from an off position to a position of maximum power. The microswitches 63 and 64 shown, on the control box 37, may each have more than one pair of contacts and be operable so that when the operating plungers 65 and 66 are depressed by a first amount, a first pair of contacts is operated, and then when the plungers of 65 and 66 are depressed further, a second pair of contacts are operated so that the power supplied to the motors driving the wheelchair can be increased in stages to enhance smoother operation in use of the wheelchair. As a further alternative, the operating plate 62 can be replaced by a substantially flat plate or other operating member connected to the lever 61 through a universal joint or a flexible Joint such as a rubber or plastics joint, movement of the operating plate or operating member being provided by a spigot attached to the plate or operating member and extending into a bore in a bush situated between the microswitches 63 and 64. With such an operating plate or member, the plate itself is rocked on movement of the control member 35 from its at rest position in the clockwise or anticlockwise direction and the same control of the vehicle is attained. The wheels provided on the plungers 65 and 66 and microswitches 63 and 64 respectively are not then necessary.
