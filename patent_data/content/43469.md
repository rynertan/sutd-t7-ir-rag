## Description
lNTERFERENCE RESISTANT TEST DEVICE FOR DETERMINING A PEROXIDATIVELY ACTIVE StJBSTANCE IN A TEST SAMPLE AND METHOD FOR PREPARING IT BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The present invention relates to the determination of a peroxidatively active substance in a test sample. More particularly, the invention relates to a test device for such determination which is resistant to possible adverse effects from ascorbic acid which might also be present in the sample. Many analytical methods are presently available for detecting the presence of peroxidatively active substances in samples such as urine fecal suspensions, and gastrointestinal contents. Hemoglobin and its derivatives are typical of such peroxidatively active substances because they behave in a manner similar to the enzyme peroxidase. Such substances have also been referred to as pseudoperoxidases.Peroxidatively active substances are enzyme like in that they catalyze the redox reaction between peroxides and such indicator compounds as benzidine, o tolidine, 3, 3 , 5, 5 tetra methylbenzidine, 2, 7 diaminofluorene or similar indicator s ubstances, thereby producing a detectable Response such IS a color change. Silence, most methods br determining the presence of occult blood in test samples rely on this pseudoperoxidase activity.Description of the Prior Art Several methods have evolved over the years which rely on enzyme like catalysis of the peroxidic oxidation of colorforming indicators. Primarily these include wet chemical procedures and dip and read type reagent bearing strips.Of the former, a typical example is set forth in Richard M.Henry, et al., Chemical Chemistry Principles and Techniques Hagerstown, Maryland Harper and Row, 1974 , pp.1124 1125. This procedure involves the use of glacial acetic acid buffer , diphenylamine indicator , and hydrogen peroxide. While such wet methods have proven analytical ability, they are nevertheless fraught with obvious shortcomings, not the least of which are poor reagent stability, inadequate sensitivity, and susceptibility to interference from ascorbate. A second method for the determination of peroxidatively active substances, and the one presently preferred by most clinical assayists and analysts, utilizes the so called dip andread reagent strips. Typical of such devices are reagent strips manufactured by the Ames Division of Miles Laboratories, Inc. and sold under the name HEMASTIX 3 . These comprise, in essence, a porous paper matrix affixed to a plastic strip or handle. The matrix is impregnated with a buffered mixture of an organic hydroperoxide and o tolidine.Upon immersion in a liquid containing hemoglobin, myoglobin, erythrocytes or other pseudoperoxidases, a blue color develops in the matrix, the intensity of which is proportional to the concentration of the peroxidatively active substance in the sample. Thus, by comparing the color developed in the matrix to a standard color chart, the assayist can determine, on a semiquantitative basis, the amount of analyte present in the sample. The advantages of reagent strips over wet chemistry methods are predominantly twofold strips are easier to use because neither the preparation of reagents nor the attendant apparatus is required and greater stability of reagents is afforded, resulting in improved accuracy, sensitivity and economy. In the case of urinalysis, however, the recent popularity of diets which include high dosages of vitamin C ascorbic acid has led to serious problems in analyzing for such urine constituents as occult blood, since patients on such diets invariably have atypically elevated levels of urinary ascorbate, and since ascorbate interferes with the test. The adverse effects of reducing agents such as ascorbate were recognized as early as 1938. R. Kohn and R. M.Watrous, Journal of Biological Chemistry, 124, 163 168 1938 . That the same problem still plagues this area of analysis is evidenced by a proposal in 1979 that when an occult blood pseudoperoxidase analysis in urine is performed, a simultaneous ascorbate analysis be performed in order to gauge the accuracy of the occult blood determination. L.Nielsen, P. J. Jorgensen and A. C. Hansen, Ugeskrift forLaeger, 141, 791 793 1979 . Although many attempts at removing ascorbate interference with other test systems, such as glucose sensitive reagents, are reported in the literature, to date no successful attempts have been reported whereby the determination of peroxidatively active substances has been rendered immune to these adverse effects. With the glucose sensitive systems, approaches range from filtering out ascorbate before it reaches the reagents to utilizing an enzyme to decompose it in situ. Thus, Canadian Patent No. 844, 564, issued to Dahlqvist on June 16, 1970, discloses a device for glucose determination in urine or other media which includes, in addition to a porous portion impregnated with normal glucose responsive reagents, an additional portion to receive the urine test sample. The sample receiving portion comprises an ion exchange material, whose singular function in the device is to adsorb any ascorbate which might be present in the urine sample. Another approach to alleviating ascorbate interference is reflected in United States Patent No. 4, 168, 205, which issued on September 18, 1979, to Danninger et al. This reference suggests incorporating the enzyme ascorbate oxidase into the test reagent formulation, the theory being that if ascorbate is present in the sample it will be enzymatically oxidized to dehydroascorbate, a compound which does not adversely effect the desired analysis. United States Patent No. 3, 411, 887, which issued to Ku on November 19, 1968, describes a way of eliminating ascorbate interference with reagent systems which rely on enzymatic oxidizing substances such as glucose oxidase. An ascorbate trapping system is employed. This comprises an ionizable heavy metal compound which, when in an ionized state possesses an oxidation reduction potential Erred between that of the redox indicator dye... and that of ascorbate . Many metals are cited as examples, including cobalt, iron, mercury and nickel. In addition to these studies, attention to the ascorbate problem with glucose tests is manifested by 1. H. Gifford, et al., J. Amer. Med. Assoc., 178, 149 150 1961 . 2. P. O Gorman, et al., Brit. Med J., 603 606 1960 . 3. R. Brandt, et al., Clin. Chem. Acta, 51, 103 104 1974 . 4. R. Brandt, et al., Am. J. Clin. Pathol., 68, 592 594 1977 . Like the above cited Ku patent other references deal with the complexing and oxidation of ascorbate using cobalt.G. Bragagnolo Ann. Chim. Applicate, 31, 350 368, 1941 reported that solutions of ascorbic acid were oxidized by air in the presence of cobalt metal. Similar activity has been reported for Co NH3 6 C13 by Tomokichi Iwasaki in Journal of the Chemical Society of Japan, 63, 820 826 1942 . Significantly, although the prior art deals extensively with glucose analysis, it appears bereft of suggestions as to how to solve the ascorbate interference problem with the determination of peroxidatively active substances such as peroxidase and occult blood hemoglobin . The disclosure in U. S. Patent No.3, 411, 887 see above notwithstanding, the prior art unequivocally teaches that metal ions, such as Co III , are in fact pseudoperoxidases. For example, Co III acetate is used commercially to catalytically decompose cumene hydroperoxide. The Merck Index, 9th Ed., Page 311 1976 . A series of Co III complexes are reported to catalytically de compose peroxides by Kh. Lohs., Monatsber. Deut. Akad. Wiss. Berlin, 8, 657 659 1966 See Chemical Abstracts, 67, 120383z, 1967 . As is stated supra, the present invention deals with improving the present state of the art system for determining peroxidatively active substances. Such systems invariably comprise an organic hydroperoxide such as cumene hydroperoxide, and a redox indicator such as o tolidine or 3, 3 , 5, 5 tetramethyl benzidine. The analyte, because it mimics the enzyme peroxidase, causes a reaction between the indicator and organic hydroperoxide which yields a color, the intensity of which is a barometer of the analyte concentration. In light of the unmistakable prior art teachings of peroxidase activity shown by Co III complexes, one skilled in the art clearly would not expect such a substance to be compatible with the peroxide indicator system.If one incorporates an analyte into the very reagent formulation designed to change color in the presence of that analyte, it is to be expected that false positive results would be obtained. These conclusions notwithstanding, it has surprisingly been found that the peroxidatively activeCo III complexes not only fail to give false positive results, but they actually improve the reagent system, making it even more dependable, i. e., less sensitive to the inaccuracies caused by ascorbate interference. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Briefly stated, the present invention relates to a test device for detecting the presence of a peroxidatively active substance in a test sample, which composition is resistant to the interfering effects of ascorbic acid present in the sample.Moreover, a method for preparing the device is likewise within the ambit of invention disclosed herein. The device comprises a carrier matrix incorporated with an organic hydroperoxide and an indicator capable of providing a detectable response such as a color change, in the presence of the peroxidatively active substance and peroxide. In addition, the matrix is incorporated with a complex of Co III and a compound having the structureEMI7.1 in which R is the residue of a substituted or unsubstituted carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring system. The ring comprises 4 to 7 atoms. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The organic hydroperoxide contemplated for use in the test composition can be selected from many well known or gan c hydroperoxides. It must, however, be capable of interacting with a peroxidatively active substance in the presence of an indicator to produce a detectable response such as a color change or change in the amount of light absorbed or reflected by the test composition. Among hydroperoxides which have been found suitable are t butyl hydroperoxide, cumerie hydroperoxide, diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide, 2, 5 dimethyl hexane 2, 5 dihydroperoxide, param enthane hydroperoxide or mixtures thereof. Of these, cumene hydroperoxide has been found to be most preferable. There exist many indicators which are capable of producing a detectable response in the presence of an organic hydroperoxide and a peroxidatively active substance and which are, therefore, suitable for use in the present invention. loc the most part, these include the so called benzidine type compounds. Typical of these are benzidine, o tolidine, 3,3 , 5, 5 tetra lower alkyl benzidine, 2, 7 diaminofluorene or mixtures of these in varying proportions. By lower alkyl is meant an alkyl radical having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, including methyl, ethyl, n propyl and isopropyl, and the various butyl, pentyl and hexyl isomers. The Co III complexes useful in the present invention include Co NH3 6C13, cobalt III acetylacetonate, Co NH3 5 H2O C13, Co NH3 5CO3 NO3, Co NH3 4CO3 NO3 3H2 0 and others. Of course, it is understood that many other cobalt III complexes are adaptable to the invention given the teachings herein. It has been found that Co NH3 6C13 provides excellent results, and is the preferred complex for achieving abatement of asc orb ate interference. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the composition comprises cumene hydroperoxide, 3, 3 , 5, 5 tetramethylbenzidine and Co NH3 6C13. The fused ring compound of the present invention is defined broadly as having the structureEMI8.1 in which R is the residue of a carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring, and which may be substituted or unsubstituted. Compounds among those included in this definition, and their counterparts with respect to R in the above structure, are as follow s EMI8.2 6 Methoxyquinoline EMI9.1 6 Hydr oxyqui noli ne EMI9.2 1 OH rido 3, 2 b 1, 4 benzothiazineEMI9.3 4 Az afluoreneEMI9.4 5, 6 BenzoquinolineThe above compounds demor strate that R can be carbocyclic I,II, IV and V or heterocyclic III . Mixtures of these compounds can also be used.Moreover, the Examples, infra, illustrate not only the efficacy of these compounds, but also the wide diversification of substitution permissible with respect to substitution of the R. residue. Preparation of the test device includes incorporating the composition with a suitable carrier matrix, and the latter can take on a multitude of forms. Thus, i. S. Patent No. 3, 846, 247 teaches the use of felt, porous ceramic strips, and woven or matted glass fibers. Additionally, U. S. Patent No.3, 552, 928 teaches the use of wood sticks, cloth, sponge material, and argillaceous substances. The use of synthetic resin fl eeces and glass fiber felts as a carrier matrix is suggested in British Patent No. 1, 369, 139. Another BritishPatent No. 1, 349, 623, proposes the use of light permeable meshwork of thin filaments as a cover for an underlying paper matrix. Polyamide fibers are taught in French Patent No. 2, 170, 397. The usefulness of these suggestions in the present invention notwithstanding, however, the material predominantly used in the art as a carrier matrix, and that which is especially suitable for the present invention, is a bibulous paper such as filter paper. It can thus be seen that there is a great deal of leeway in selecting an appropriate material for use as a carrier matrix, and the matrix can take on various physical forms. All of these types are intended as being within the scope of the present invention. The ingredients of the present invention can be incorporated with the carrier matrix in a variety of ways. They can be dissolved or suspended in such suitable solvents as water, dimethylformamide, chloroform, methylene chloride, methanol, cyclohexane or mixtures thereof. Such a solution or suspension can then be used a to impregnate filter paper, b as an ink wherein the reagents are printed on a suitable matrix, or c the carrier matrix can be coated with the composition, such as with a doctor blade. These and other means of contacting the carrier matrix are within the purview of the invention herein. The presently preferred method is to impregnate filter paper with a solution or suspension of the composition, the preferred solvent being distilled or deionized water used alone or mixed with dimethylformamide. Impregnation can be accomplished by dipping a piece of filter paper into the appropriate solution and drying the dipped paper in an air oven. The dried paper is then cut into a square measuring about 0. 5 cm on a side, which is then mounted on one end of a polystyrene film strip measuring about 0.6 x 10 cm. Mounting is accomplished through use of double faced adhesive tape, such as that available from the 3M Co., known as Double Stick. Especially preferred in formulating the device is the method wherein the organic hydroperoxide and indicator are introduced into the filter paper as a first mixture or solution.The Co III complex and fused ring compound are then subsequently applied as an aqueous second mixture or solution, with drying after each application. Such a two dip process, where the carrier matrix is impregnated with the Co III complex in the second dip, has been found preferable, although ascorbate resistance can also result from methods such as where theCo III complex is applied as the first dip or all the ingredients are mixed together as a single dip. The following examples are provided to further illustrate the concepts and advantages of the presently disclosed invention. They show how to make and use the invention, they present comparative data demonstrating the improved ascorbate resistance it providers, and they illustrate the presently preferred embodiments thereof. These examples are, how ever, not to be interpreted as limiting in any way the scope of the invention. EXAMPLES Various fused ring compounds were employed as were various Co III complexes in preparing test devices of the present invention. These were then tested in urine samples containing varying quantities of ascorbate and occult blood to determine the effects of ascorbate on the efficacy of the devices. Finally, experiments were performed to study the order of addition of reagents to the carrier matrix and its effect on the resistance of the test device to ascorbate interference.A. Various Fused Ring CompoundsExample I 6 Hydroxyquinoline This experiment illustrates the preparation of a test de vice using 6 hydroxyquinoline. A first dip solution was prepared by mixing 0. 12 grams of Co NH3 6 Cl3 in 80 ml distilled water. Next, a square of Eaton and Dikeman filter paper No. 222 measuring 4 x 4 in.was immersed in the first dip solution and dried in an air oven at 95 C. for 10 minutes. A second dip solution was prepared by mixing the following ingredients in the order as listed Distilled water 35 ml Sodium citrate 1. 50 g Citric acid 1. 92 g Triethanolamine borate 3. 5 g Ethylenediaminetetracetic acid tetrasodium salt 0. 10 g Methyl sulfone 4. 66 g Sodium dodecyl sulfate 0. 52 g Dimethyl formamide 35 ml t 3, 3 , 5, 5 Tetramethylbenzidine 0.42 g Cumene hydroperoxide 1.4g milliliters grams these ingredients combined together before addition to the mixture To a 10 ml aliquot of this solution was added 0. 036 g of 6 hydroxyquinoline. The filter paper square containing the first dip residue was then immersed in the 10 ml aliquot of second dip solution and dried at 95 C for 10 minutes in an air oven. Assembly of the test device comprised applying a 0. 6 centimeter cm. square of the dried, impregnated paper to one end of a polystyrene film strip measuring 0. 6 by 10 cm.using double faced adhesive tape 3M Company, Double Stick 415 . Testing of the device in urine containing both hemoglobin and ascorbate yields easily discernible color levels corresponding to various hemoglobin concentrations. Example II 6 Methoxyquinoline The procedure of Example I was followed in preparing a test device containing 6 methoxyquinoline 6MQ . Instead of using 6 hydroxyquinoline, 0. 040 g of 6MQ was added to a 10 ml second dip aliquot. Testing of the device in urine containing both hemoglobin and ascorbate yields easily discernible color levels corresponding to the hemoglobin concentrations.Example III 5, 6 Benzoquinoline A test device was prepared by following the procedure of Example I, except that instead of using 6 hydroxyquinoline, 0. 045 g of 5, 6 benzoquinoline was added to a 10 ml aliquot of the second dip solution. When the resultant device is tested in urine containing both hemoglobin and ascorbate, easily discernible color levels corresponding to the hemoglobin concentrations are observed.Example IV 4 Azafluorene A test device was prepared by following the procedure of Example I, except that, instead of using 6 hydroxyquinoline, 0. 042 g of 4 azafluorene was added to a 10 ml aliquot of the second dip solution. When the resultant device is tested in urine containing both hemoglobin and ascorbate, easily discernible color levels corresponding to the hemoglobin concentrations are observed.Example V 10H Pyrido 3, 2 b 1, 4 benzothiazine A test device was prepared by following the procedure ofExample I except that, instead of using 6 hydroxyquinoline, 0.050 g of l0H pyrido 3, 2 b l1 4 benzothiazine was added to a 10 ml aliquot of the second dip solution When the resultant device is tested in urine containing both hemoglobin and ascorbate, easily discernible color levels corresponding to the hemoglobin levels are qbserved.Example VI Various Co III Complexes A series of experiments was performed to explore the efficacy of various Co III complexes in abating ascorbate interference with occult blood analysis in urine. Accordingly, test devices were prepared as in Example I. The two dip formulations were as follows First dip Co III complex see below 0.0056M Distilled water 100 ml Second dip Distilled water 50 ml Sodium citrate 2.13 g Citric acid 2. 77 g Triethanolamine borate 5. 00 g Methyl sulfone 6. 67 g Sodium lauryl sulfate 0.75 g Ethylenediaminetetracetic acid 0.13 g Dimethylformamide 50. 0 ml 6 Methoxyquinoline 0. 4 ml Cumene hydroperoxide 2. 0 ml 3, 3 , 5, 5 Tetramethylbenzidine 0. 60 g sufficient quantity to make first dip 0. 0056 Molar in Co III complex milliliters grams Separate test devices were prepared wherein the Co III complex used in the first dip was Co NH3 6Cl3, cobalt III acetylacetonate, Co NH3 5H2O C13, Co NH3 5CO NO3, or Co NH 3 4CO3 NO3 3H20, respectively. With each Co Ill complex, the resultant test device provides improved resistance to ascorbate inhibition when tested with urine containing both hemoglobin and ascorbate.B. Ascorbate Resistance TestingExample VII Effects of Various Fused Ring Compounds A series of experiments was conducted in order to study the effects of ascorbate on the test devices of the present invention. Test devices were prepared as described in ExamplesI V. In addition, control devices were prepared in exactly the same manner as Example VI except that the cobalt complex was omitted, i. e. only the second dip was used to impregnate the filter paper carrier matrix. These devices were assessed by dipping into test samples comprising negative urine, and aliquots thereof to which had been added human whole blood, ascorbic acid or both. The appearance of color was noted visually after one minute and assigned a numerical value corresponding to standard relative color intensity values. A control strip was dipped into urine samples containing various concentrations of hemoglobin, but no ascorbate. Standard color values were assigned as follows Hemoglobin my O 0.015 0.030 0.135 0.405 Color value 0 10 20 30 40 milligrams per deciliter Thus1 the color formed in the control device upon being dipped in a urine sample having no hemoglobin present was ascribed a color value of 0 whereas the color produced by a urine con taining 0. 405 milligrams hemoglobin per 100 milliliters was assigned the value of 40. The results are as follows Urine Sample Visual Results after 1 min Hemo Ascorbic Ex globin Acid Con Test ample mg mg trol Device I 0.030 0 20 10 0.030 25 8 8 II 0.030 0 20 20 0.030 25 8 18 III 0.030 0 20 20 0.030 25 8 15 IV 0.030 0 20 20 0.030 25 8 18 V 0.030 0 20 20 0.0 30 25 8 20 anomalous data As can be seen from the above data, devices prepared using various fused ring compounds all possess similarly excellent resistance to ascorbate interference whereas the control devices exhibit ascorbate interference susceptibility. Example VIII Effects of Various Co III Complexes Experiments similar to those of Example VII were conducted with the devices prepared in Example VI. Instead of using the visual observation technique of Example VII, color formation was followed using a device known as the Rapid Scanner . This device is a scanning reflectance spectrophotometer interfaced with a PDP 12 computer obtained from the Digital Equipment Corporation. The instrument is used for the rapid measurement of reflectance spectra in the visual range. The computer allows for the storage of spectral data and computations. Measurements of the performances of reagent strips in the Rapid Scanner have the following advantages over visual observations of the same strips 1. The light source and conditions surrounding the sample remain fixed. In visual readings the light source can vary, not only in wavelength components, but also in relation to the location of the strip being observed. 2. The detector characteristics remain fixed with theRapid Scanner. In visual observation, the detector i. e. the eyes of the observer varies from person to person, and with the same person, from day to day. 3. The Rapid Scanner allows more precise quantitation of the data than does human observation, thereby permitting comparisons between results to be made in a more objective manner than with visual observation. The Rapid Scanner instrument was constructed by the Ames Division of Miles Laboratories, Inc., Elkhart,Indiana, U. S. A., from whom complete information with respect to structural and performance characteristics are obtainable. Tri stimulus values from the Rapid Scanner were used to calculate color difference values hE according to the con vention contained within Supplement No. 2 to Commission In ternationale de L Eclairage Paris, France Publication No.15, Colorimetry, E. 1. 3. 1 , 1971. The data from this instrument are therefore recorded below in teims of A E or color difference units. Thus, as in Example VII, control devices with no Co III complex were compared with those from Example VI which contained various Co III complexes. The comparison was performed using urines containing various hemoglobin levels with and without ascorbate. The color difference units hE provided by the RapidScanner correspond to hemoglobin levels in the absence of ascorbate in accordance with the following Hemoglobin mg 70 0 0.015 0.030 0.045 0.135 AE 0 40 50 58 63This data was obtained from the Rapid Scanner using the control devices, i. e., devices prepared as in Example VI except that no Co III complex was present. When the devices of Example VI containing various cobalt III complexes were tested in urine samples containing 0. 135 mg hemoglobin with and without ascorbate, the results were as follows Co III Urine SampleCom Hemo Ascorbic plex globin Acid Con Test mg mg Mo trol DeviceA 0.135 0 63 57 0.135 50 18 35B 0.135 0 63 60 0.135 50 18 27C 0.135 0 63 62 0.135 50 18 43D 0.135 0 63 54 0.135 50 18 49 A Co IU acetylacetonate B Co NH3 5H2 O C13 C Co NH3 5CO3 NO3 D Co NH 4CO 3 NO3. 3H2O The table portrays data which evidences a dramatic reduction in susceptibility to ascorbate interference due to the presence of a Co III complex and a fused ring compound.Example IX Because of the prior art teachings of the peroxidative activity of cobalt III , devices prepared using Co NH3 6 Cl3 as in Example VI and the control device prepared as in Example VI except without the cobalt complex were tested for stability. This experiment showed virtually no difference in stability between the devices, despite the fact that one would expect the cumene hydroperoxide in the composition to decompose rapidly in the presence of Co III . The cobalt containing and control devices were stressed by being stored for two weeks in an air oven kt 50 C. These stressed devices, as well as unstressed ones, were then dipped in negative urine and negative urine to which had been added various amounts of human whole blood. The appear ance of color was evaluated as in Example l I, i e. visually after one minute. The data is as follows Control Hemoglobin Visual Results after 1 Minute mg ,to Unstressed 2 wks. 500 C 0. 000 0 0 0.015 20 19 .0.030 22 21 0.045 25 25 0.135 30 32 0. 405 40 40 Device with Co NH, C13 Hemoglobin Visual Results after 1 Minute mg Olo Unstressed 2 wks. 50 C 0. 000 0 0 0.015 20 18 0.030 21 21 0.045 25 23 0.135 32 30 0.405 40 40 As can be seen from the above data, no incompatibility between the peroxide and Co III , even after storage at 500 C for two weeks, is evident. Moreover, the cobalt containing test devices are equally as sensitive as the control devices without the presence of cobalt III . D. A Method for Preparing the DeviceExample X The Effects of Ordered Addition An experiment was conducted to study the method for preparing the test device, and to explore the effect of varying the order of addition of reagents to the carrier matrix. When devices are prepared by adding the Co III complex as a first dip Example VI , excellent ascorbate resistance is noted.However, when the order of addition is reversed, i. e., the complex is added as a second dip, ascorbate resistance was found to be diminished. Surprisingly, when the fused ring compound is combined with the Co III in the second dip, the ascorbate resistance returns to the level of devices prepared as in Example VI. Three sets of test devices were prepared. Set a was prepared by incorporating Co NH3 6C13 into a paper matrix as a first dip, the remaining components, including the fused ring compound, being added as a second dip. The devices of set b were prepared in reverse order of addition of set a , i. e., the cobalt complex being added as the second dip, the other ingredients comprising the first dip. Set c illustrates devices prepared where the second dip comprises both the cobalt complex and the fused ring compound. Set a Co III in first dip Test devices were prepared wherein Co NH3 6 Cl3 was added as an aqueous first dip, which was formulated by dissolving 0. 13 g Co NH3 6C13 in 10 ml distilled water. This solution was used to impregnate a piece of laboratory filter paper Eaton Dikeman No. 237 , which was then dried for 10 minutes in an air oven at 95 C. A second dip solution was prepared by combining the following components in the order as listed. Distilled water 25 ml Sodium citrate 1. 07 g Citric acid 1.38 g Triethanolamine borate 3. 33 g Methyl sulfone 3. 33 g Dimethylformamide 25.0 ml 6 Methoxyquinoline 200 Cumene hydroperoxide 1.0 ml 3, 3 , 5, 5 Tetramethylbenzidine 0. 30 gTo 20 ml of this solution were added Sodium lauryl sulfate 0. 20 g Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid 0. owl g to make up the tetrasodium salt second dip solution. The dried, cobalt impregnated paper was immersed in the second dip and dried as before at 95 C for 10 minutes. Devices prepared by this method were tested as indicated below to study their resistance tu ascorbate inteftecence when used to analyze hemoglobin in urine. The results are as follows Urine Sample Visual Results Hemoglobin Ascorbic mg No Acid mug 0 0 3 0.135 0 30 0.135 50 20 The data indicates good ascorbate resistance, i. e., relatively low interference with the hemoglobin analysis. Set b Co IU in second dip A second set of test devices was prepared wherein the cobalt complex was added as the second dip. In this experi event a piece of the filter paper used for Set a , above, was immersed in the second dip solution, dried, and then immersed into the cobalt containing first dip and redried.Other than reversing the order of addition1 the method was identical to that used for Set a . When tested as in Example IV with urines with and without hemoglobin and or ascorbate the results were as follows Urine Sample Visual Results Hemoglobin Ascorbic mg No Acid mgNo 0 0 1 0.135 0 28 0.135 50 5 The data indicates a dramatic susceptibility to interference by the presence of ascorbate in the test sample. Set c Co III and fused ring compound in second dip A third set of test devices was prepared wherein the second dip contained both cobalt complex and the fused ring compound. The first dip was prepared by combining the following ingredients in the order as listed Distilled water 50 ml Sodium citrate 2.13 g Citric acid 2.77 g Triethanolamine borate 6. 67 g Ethylenediaminetetr aacetic acid, tetrasodium salt 0. 07 g Methyl sulfone 6. 67 g Sodium lauryl sulfate 1.00 gTo a 10 ml aliquot of this solution was added 10 ml dimethylformamide, 0. 4 g cumene hydroperoxide and 0. 12 g of 3,3 , 5, 5 tetramethylbenzidine. A piece of laboratory filter paper Eaton Dikeman No.222 was immersed in the first dip solution and dried at 950 C for 10 minutes in an air oven, whereupon the dried paper was immersed into the second dip solution. The second dip was prepared by dissolving 0. 24 g Co NH3 6C13 in 80 ml of distilled water. To 10 ml of this solution was added 10 ml dimethylformamide followed by 80p1 6 methoxyquinoline. Following immersion in the second dip, the filter paper was again dried for 10 minutes at 95 C. When this test paper was immersed in urines with hemoglobin with or without ascorbate, the following data was obtained Urine Sample Visual Results Hemoglobin Ascorbic mgSo Acid mg 0.135 0 5 0.135 0 40 0.135 50 38 Note these devices were more sensitive than those in sets a and b above, perhaps because E 222 paper was used instead of E D 237. The data shows the devices of set c have a remarkable degree of resistance to ascorbate interference when used to analyze for hemoglobin in urine.
