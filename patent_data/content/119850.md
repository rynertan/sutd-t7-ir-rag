# Layer casting apparatus.

## Abstract
A device for the application of at least one cast layer 7 on a moving sheet shaped substrate 4 has a rotating casting roll 1 which guides the substrate. A pouring vessel 8 is arranged adjacent to the casting roll while leaving a casting gap 13 . A suction device with a housing 15 has a low pressure chamber 16 extending from the gap 13 to a par tition 25 and has a vacuum chamber 17 extending from the partition 25 to an end wall 26 . Partition 25 and or end wall 26 can be adjusted in circumferential direction. The low pressure chamber 16 and the vacuum chamber 17 are con nected with each other by means of a bypass 51 . In this way, even under varying operating conditions, a high constancy of the pressure in the low pressure chamber 16 can be attained.
