# PREFORM FOR USE IN BLOW MOLDING A CONTAINER SUBJECTED TO HOT FILLING AND CLOSED BY A ROTATABLE CLOSURE AND METHOD OF AN APPARATUS FOR MAKING THE SAME

## Abstract
This relates to a preform which is injection molded and which is especially intended for use in the blow molding of a container suitable for receiving a hot fill product. Most particularly, the neck finish of the preform, which becomes the neck finish of the resultant blow molded container, is reinforced against axial compression or foreshortening as may occur when the neck finish is heated to a temperature approaching the glass transition temperature of the polyes ter from which the neck finish is formed. So as to resist deformation of the neck finish, the neck finish is provided on the interior surface mouth thereof with a plurality of axially extending, radially inwardly projecting, circumferentially spaced ribs. If the thread means of the neck finish for receiving a closure is of the interrupted type, there will be at least one rib for each thread element.
