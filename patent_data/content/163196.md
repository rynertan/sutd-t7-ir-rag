# Multi state signal monitor circuit.

## Abstract
A multi state signal monitor circuit for a data transmis sion system which transmits a plurality of bits of data after conversion into a multi state signal and obtains original data of plural bits through analog to digital conversion of the received multi state signal. Data is discriminated more precisely than the number of bits of data of a plurality of bits on the occasion of analog to digital conversion in the receiving side 10B and the focusing degree of the received signal to the quantization level is detected by utilizing said extra bits. Thereby the error rate is monitored quickly and accurately with simplified circuits. The monitor circuit comprises an A D converter 120 and a pseudo error rate measuring circuit 122 .
