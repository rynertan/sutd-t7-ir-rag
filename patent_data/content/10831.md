# Electrical connector.

## Abstract
An electrical connector for electrically interconnect ing a pair of spaced apart, substantially parallel, electrically conductive pins comprises a housing 9 having opposed, spaced apart cover members 11, 13 and a central hub 15 between the cover members. The connector further includes a resilient, electrically conductive contact member 16 which is disposed around the hub 15 in a loose fit relationship. The contact member defines a pair of opposed contact portions 21 comprising surfaces disposed gener ally parallel to the mounting direction of the connector. During mounting and dismounting of the connector from a pair of pins, spaced by a distance less than the distance between the contact portions of the contact member, the force applied to the contact member 16 through the hub 15 effects an elongation of the contact member longitu dinally of the pins, between which the contact member becomes laterally compressed to effect the required electri cal interconnection.
