## Description
Folding gooseneck trailer The invention relates to folding gooseneck trailers and has for its object to provide an improvement therein. h folding gooseneck trailer is a trailer with a low load carIving platform or bed with a raised so called gooseneck structureat the front end, and a raised structure at the rear over the rear wheels. The gooseneck structure at the front end can be articulated by means of a so called fifth wheel mechanism to a tractor unit. It is also foldable, that is to say capable of adjustment into a co planar or substantially co planar position with respect to the load carrying platform or bed. A folding gooseneck trailer is very useful for the loading and transport of heavy construction plant for example, that is to say self propelled dumper trucks, tractors, loaders and the like as well as other self propelled units such as cranes. This is because the load carrying body or bed can be lowered so that its front end rests upon the ground with the foldable gooseneck lowered to the ground and extending forwardly from the load carrying body or bed, and forming also a ramp up which the item of heavy equipment can be driven. When the item of equipment concerned has been loaded onto the the load carrying body, the gooseneck part can be returned to its normal position so that a tractor unit can be coupled to it and the tractor trailer combination driven away. here are a great many folding gooseneck trailers of various constructions in existence but in most cases the loading and unloading operation is time consuming and difficult. The forward end of the load carrying platform or bed is usually provided with adjustable support means, that is to say screw operated jacks or hydraulically aparated legs on which the forward end of the load carrying platform or bed must be supported before the foldable gooseneck can be disconnected from the tractor unit and lowered. The operation of such jacks or legs is time consuming and sometimes difficult and the adjustment of the foldable gooseneck is frequently also time consuming and difficult. According to the invention there is provided a folding gooseneck trailer having a forwardly extending gooseneck structure connected by means of a parallelogram or substantially parallelogram linkage to the load carrying platform or bed, the links of said linkage being of such a length that, with said forwardly extending gooseneck structure connected to a conventional tractor unit for articulated movement therewith, the front end of said load carrying platform or bed can be lowered to rest upon the ground by said links being brought to a vertical or near vertical position relative to said platform or bed, whereupon the tractor unit can be disconnected to allow the forwardly extending gooseneck structure to be lowered into co planar or substantially co planar relation anth said platform or bed, and so that when reconnected to the tractor unit the trailer can be brought to a normal travelling condition, that is to say the front end of the load carrying platform or bed canbe brought back to its previously raised position, by bringing the links to an appropriately inclined position, relative to said platform or bed by the operation of force exerting means.The force exerting means will preferably be linearly acting means disposed generally within the parallelepiped or substantially parallelepipedic volume defined by the linkage and the lateral width of the trailer. Seen in side view the force exerting means wall preferably lie generally within the parallelogram or substantial parallelogram of the linkage. However, it need not occupy the same position laterally of the trailer, and indeed it may well be convenient for the force exerting means to be laterally spaced from the links. The force exerting means is preferably one or more hydraulic rams but could be some other device, such as a screw arrangement or motor means for turning the screw. When the force exerting means are constituted by one or more hydraulic rams, the or each hydraulic ram may be pivotally connected at one end at the pivot point by which one of the links of the linkage is iNrotally connected to the load carrying platform or bed and pivotally connected at its other end at the pivot point by which the other link of the linkage is pivotally connected to the forwardly extending gooseneck structure.The trailer may be provided with a solid link capable of being placed in position between a pair of pivot points, that is to say a pivot point on the load carrying platform or bed and a pivot point on the forwardly extending goose neck structure, said link being fitted when it is desired to relieve the force exerting means of all load during road travel. In order that the invention may be fully understood and readily carried into effect, embodiments will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic side view of a folding gooseneck trailer embodying the invention, shown in its normal road running condition Figure 2 is a view similar to Figure 1 but showing the trailer in a condition allowing the connection and disconnection of a conventional tractor unit Figure 3 is a view showing the trailer in a condition for the loading and unloading of heavy plant Figure 4 is a view similar to Figure 1 but showing the trailer in a condition facilitating the negotiation of a hump backed bridge and Figure 5 is a slightly enlarged view, which will be referred to when describing a possible modification. Referring now to Figure 1 of the drawings, the folding gooseneck trailer there illustrated has a loadcarrying platform or bed 10, with gooseneck structures at both ends, that is to say a rearmost gooseneck structure 12, which is fixed relative to said platform or bed, for connection to a set of rear wheels generally indicated 14, and a forwardly extending gooseneck structure 16 which by means of a so called fifth wheel mechanism generally indicated 18 is capable of articulated connection to a conventional tractor unit 20. The forwardly extending gooseneck structure 16 is connected by means of a parallelogram linkage 22 to the load carrying platform or bed 10, that is to say by means of equal length links 24 and 26 pivotally connected at their opposite ends to the gooseneck structure 16 and to said platform or bed. A double acting hydraulic ram 28 is shoal to be located between the structure 16 and said platform or bed, a lower end of the ram being showy to be pivotally connected about the pivotal connection for the lower end of the link 26 and an upper end of said ram being showy to be pivotally connected about the pivotal connection for the upper end of the link 24. By the appropriate control of the hydraulic ram the location of the links 24 and 20 in relation to the load carrying platform or bed can be adjusted. Referring now to Figure 2, it will be seen that the links 24 and 26 are of such a length that the front end of the load carrying platform or bed can be lowered to rest upon the ground by said links being brought to a vertical or near vertical position relative to said platform or bed. Jhen the load carrying platform or bed has been brought to this position, the tractor unit can be disconnected and driven away from the trailer, there upon the forwardly extending gooseneck structure can be lowered into co planar or substantially co planar relation with said platform or bed and rests upon the ground as shorn in Figure 3.In this position, the structure 16 forms a ramp up which items of equipment which are to be transported by the trailer can be driven, that is to say items of earth moving equipment for example or a self propelled crane, then the platform or bed has been loaded, the structure 16 can be brought back to the raised position in which it is shoam inFigure 2 and the tractor unit can then be re connected thereto. hen reconnected to the tractor unit, the trailer can be brought back to a normal travelling condition, that is to say the front end of the loadcarrying platform or bed can be brought back to its previously raised substantially horizontal position, by operating the hydraulic ram to bring the links to an appropriately inclined position relative to said platform or bed.It will be appreciated that each pivot is at a fixed point on the link 24 or 26 and at a fixed point on the bed 10 or gooseneck structure 16. Thus there is provided a folding gooseneck trailer which can be loaded and unloaded with a minimum amount of trouble and inconvenience. Since it is devoid of the usual jacks or legs at the front end of the loadcarrying platform or bed which usually need to be lowered to take the load off the tractor unit before the latter can be disconnected the operation of loading or unloading can be carried out very quickly. A further advantage is tat if greater ground clearance is required to clear an obstacle, for example, a humped back bridge, the hydraulic ram 28 can be extended so that the links 24 and 26 are very much more inclined, even to the extent of making the gooseneck structure substantially co planar with the bed 10 and temporarily lift the front end of the load carrying platform or bed 10 higher from the ground, as shown in Figure 4. It will of course be understood that the hydraulic ram is under constant compression when the platform or bed has been if ted from the ground. However, the hydraulic ram is a very high duty component so that it is thought that this fact will not be a safety hazard.If it was desired to relieve the hydraulic ram of all load during road travel, it would be a very simple matter to make a small modification, that is to say to arrange for a solid link that is to say an inextensible link of substantially the same length as the hydraulic ram is shorn to be in Figure 1 to be placed in position between those same two pivot points or if preferred between the two other pivot points as shoam in chain dotted lines inFigure 5 . The hydraulic ram 28 would then only be used when loading or unloading. It will of course be understood that for the sake of clarity the trailer has been illustrated only in side view and described as if the parallelogram linkage was constituted by simple links 24 and 26 under the control of a single hydraulic ram 28. In practice, the linkage will include links of substantial width and at least one of the links 24 and 26 may be constituted by two or more link elements spaced apart laterally of the trailer platform or bed so that the folding gooseneck has substantial lateral rigidity relative to said platform or bed. Similarly, a plurality of hydraulic rams may be provided for bringing the links to the required positions relative to the load carrying platform or bed.For example, there could be one each of links 24 and 26 at Each side of the trailer, each being of substantial width, with a ram 28 at each side also, but inboard of the links 24 and 26. Various other modifications could be made without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, the hydraulic ram 28 need not necessarily be connected between the two points shown. It could be located in any conveniently inclined position between the gooseneck structure and the load carrying platform or bed, and while it is desirable that the ram should be generally within the parallelogram linkage, it is conceivable that it could be positioned outside it. It trill also be understood that the or each hydraulic ram 28, could be replaced by some other force applying device such as a screw arrangement in which case the screw will preferably be able to be turned by suitable motor means but could conceivably be manually operable. Although the linkage illustrated in the drawings is a truly parallelogram linkage, a quadrilateral linkage could be employed which is not a true parallelogram but only substantially so.
