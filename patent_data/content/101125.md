# A coded responder for an electromagnetic detection system.

## Abstract
A coded responder for an electromagnetic detection system of the kind comprising a first resonance circuit LC₁ connected with a switch means 5 controlled by a code generator 3 . The responder is designed so as to be codable after manufacture. For this purpose it has a second reso nance circuit LC₂ coupled with the code generator 3 and by means of which the desired code can be entered wirelessly into the code generator 3 after completion of the production process.
