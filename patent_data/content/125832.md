# Deposition of zinc on aluminium.

## Abstract
In a process for applying a zinc coating to aluminium, suitable for creating a corrosion resistant zinc diffused sur face layer on the aluminium by subsequent heating, the aluminium is dipped in a bath containing an aqueous solution of zinc fluoride, preferably essentially saturated, and at a temperature in the range of 20 70 C. The bath is preferably maintained at pH 4 6.
