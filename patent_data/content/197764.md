# Purifying proinsulin like materials.

## Abstract
A process is provided for separating impurities from an impure mixture containing proinsulin like material, which comprises 1 applying said mixture to a reverse phase macropor ous acrylate ester copolymer resin support at a pH of from about 7 to about 10 and 2 eluting said proinsulin like material from said support with an aqueous eluant having a pH of from about 8 to about 11 and containing from about 10 to about 30 by volume of an organic diluent selected from the group consisting of acetone, scetonitrile, and a combination of acetone and acetonitrile.
