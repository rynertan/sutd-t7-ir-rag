## Description
14 Acyloxy 2 Ralo Anthracycline Anti Cancer Antibiotics Anthracyline antibiotics including doxorubicin, daunorubicin, and carminomycin have emerged as important chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of a broad spectrum of neoplastic conditions including acute myeloblastic and lymphoblastic leukemias. Doxorubicin also known asAdriamycin is the subject of U.S. Patent No.3,590,028 and is a prescribed antineoplastic agent used in a number of chemotherapeutic treatments. Certain undesirable side effects have limited the usefulness of known anthracyline antibiotics. One of their more serious side effects, however, is their cardiotoxicity which severely restricts the dosages and the frequency with which the antibiotic can be administered and, in turn, limits their overall effectiveness as an antibiotic. Many of the other side effects which accompany the administration of these agents can be managed by administering other pharmaceutical agents in combination with them, however, the cardiopathic effects are not easily controlled or reversed. In view of the proven effectiveness of known anthracyclines in the treatment of cancer, efforts have been undertaken to develop less toxic derivatives which can be administered in high, more effective dosages with greater frequency. The compounds disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,201,773 to Horton et al are among anthracyline derivatives that have been proposed to have better therapeutic ratios than their naturally occurring counterparts.These compounds are derivatives of adriamycin, daunomycin, and demethoxyzaunomycin in which the 3amino group in the sugar moiety is substituted ith a hydroxy group Sorton et al and Prieke also disclose a number of 2 halo derivatives of Adriamycin, daunomycin and demethoxydaunomycin in their U.S.Patent Application Serial No. 268,623 filed May 29, 1981 and refiled August 17, 1982 as U.S. PatentApplication Serial No. 408,942. One of the disadvantages of the aforementioned compounds is that they have relatively low solubility in water. This limits their usefulness and effectiveness because it often necessitates that they be administered in large volumes of infusate over a period of hours.Furthermore, in view of their low water solubility, the compounds are difficult to administer in amounts which would be effective in the treatment of some cancers. Thus, there is a need for less toxic anthracyline antibiotics which are water soluble and readily absorbed into the blood stream. The present invention relates to a novel mnthracyline antibiotic which is represented by the formula I EMI2.1 wherein R1 is ooCR3 or OOC CH2 nCOOR4 R2 is hydrogen, hydroxy or methoxy one of X andX is a halogen atom selected from the group consisting of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine and the other is hydrogen one of Y and Y is hydrogen and the other is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydroxy and acyloxy one of Z and Z is hydrogen and the other is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, hydroxy and acyloxy R3 is an alkyl group containing 1 to 8 carbon atoms R4 is a hydrogen or metal atom for example an alkali metal atom such as Na, K, and the like , or an alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and n is an integer of 0 to 6. The present invention also provides pharmaceutical preparations containing the aforesaid compounds in suitable carriers and in therapeutically effective amounts. In a more particular embodiment, the present invention provides compounds of the formula I wherein R2 is hydrogen, hydroxy or methoxy one of X and X preferably X is bromine or iodine one of Y and Y preferably Y is acetoxy or hydroxy one of Z and Z is acetoxy or hydroxy and R1 is represented by the formulaDOCR3 or ooc cH2 cooR4 wherein R4 is a hydrogen or metal atom, the balance of the substitutes being defined as above. In a still more particular embodiment, the present invention provides compounds of the formula I wherein R2 is methoxy X is iodine Y is acetoxy or hydroxy, Z or Z is acetoxy or hydroxy and R1 is hemiglutaryloxy, hemiadipyloxy, or acetoxy. The compounds of the present invention are 14 acyloxy 2 halo 3 Ïeamino derv yes of the antibiotics doxorubicin, carminomycin. and 4 demethoxydaunomycin. The anthracycline derivatives of the present invention are glycosides made up of an anthracylcinone substituted with an acyloxy group atC 14 which is coupled at C to a 2,6 dideoxy 2halo hexopyranose sugar. In general, these compounds are prepared by two alternative routes 1 By reacting l,5 anhydro 2,6 dideoxy hex l enitols 6 deoxy glycals with an equimolar amount of a 14 0 acyl aglycon in the presence ofN halogeno succinimide to form the 2 halo glycoside, or by reacting the appropriate glycals with halogen and then coupling them with anthracyclinones by using known coupling reagents for example silver trifluoromethanesulfonate . 2. By reacting the sugar with daunomycinone or 4 demethoxydaunomycinone under the above described conditions followed by functionalization of position 14 by halogenation For example bromination in an inert solvent and reacting the product with a sodium or potassium salt of a fatty acid of the formula R3COOB where R3 is defined as above analogous to the teachings inU.S. Patent No. 3,803,124. Where RÚ is a dicarboxylic acid moiety, the monosodium salt of the dicarboxylic acid may be used as above. The 14 O bemiglutarate and the 14 O hemiadipate derivatives of the present invention can be prepared by analogy to the teachings in UOS. Patent No. 4,299, 822. The conpons of the present invention are preferably prepared from 1,6 anhydro 3,4 di O acetyl 2,6 dideoxy hex 1 enitols such as 3,4 di O acetyl L fucal or 3,4 di O acetyl L rhamnhal . These sugars can DC prepared as described in B. Iselin and T. Reichstein, Belv. Chim. Acta, 27, 1146, 1200 1944 . The aglycon is usually reacted with 3, 4 di O acetyl t rhamnal or 3,4, di O acetyl L fucal in an anhydrous mixture of acetonitrile and tetrahydrofuran followed by the addition of a halogenating agent such asN iodosuccinimide or N bromosuccinimide. The halogenating agent is generally used in a stoichiometric excess, e.g., 1.5 to 3 times the amount of the aglycon on a molar basis. The synthesis of the compounds of the present invention will now be illustrated in more detail by the following examples Example 1 Preparation of 14 O acetyl 7 0 3, 4 di O acetyl 2, 6 dideoxy 2 iodo a L manno hexopyranosyl adriamycinone. 0.92 mmol 198 mg of 3,4 di O acetylL rhamnal and 0.52 mmol 239 mg of 14 0 acetyladriamycinone prepared in accordance withU.S. Patent No. 3,803,124 were added to a mixture of dry acetonitrile 14 ml and tetrahydrofuran 7 ml . The reaction mixture was flushed with dry argon and cooled to 0 C while N iodosuccinimide in an amount of 1.52 mmol 343 mg was added thereto. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 44 hours. Thin layer chromatography 3 1 toluene acetone was performed on precoated plastic sheets 0.2 mm coated with silica gel 60 F 254 E.Merck, Darmstadt, G.F.R. and showed the presence of one major and one less polar minor product. Traces of substrate were still present. The mixture was diluted with dichloromethane 100 ml and shaken twice with 10 aqueous sodium thiosufate 50 1 , and washed twice with an excess of water. The organic layer was dried with MgSO4. Piltration and evaporation of the solvent gave a thick, dark, red syrup which was dissolved in chloroform and evaporated onto silica gel 3 g . The red powder thus obtained was placed on a column of silica gel 60 230 400 mesh E. Merck. Darmstadt, G.F.R. . 30 g in 2 1 hexane ethyl acetate The column was eluted first with 2 1 hexane ethyl acetate 200 ml and then with 8 1 toluene acetone. Two fractions were obtained. The more polar one was isolated and fully characterized after crystalization from acetone, ethyl ether, and hexane, m.p. 130 135 C á 21 94 c 0.02, chloroform KBr 3380 D max OH , 1745 1720 C O , 1610 and 1575 cm 1 chelated quinone lH n.m.r.
