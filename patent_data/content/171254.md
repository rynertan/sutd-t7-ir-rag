# Shaped chitin body.

## Abstract
A shaped chitin body prepared by treating a shaped body of chitin with an alkali solution, such that within a dilute aque ous solution of acetic acid, the volume of said shaped chitin body will increase by a factor of at least about 10 while sub stantially retaining its shape. This shaped chitin body has ver satile capabilities comparable to those of chitosan. A non woven fabric made of a fibrous chitin body is particularly effec tive as a wound dressing.
