## Abstract
A helicopter transmission system includes a gear box comprising a gearcase 11 having a hollow stub axle 12 by which operational loads are transmitted from a main sustaining rotor to a fuselage structure. One or more input speed reducing gear trains 20, 21, 22, 23 are individually supported in hollow lobe por tion s 14 supported from the axle 12 , the or each lobe portion having an individual lubricating oil sump 18 and circulating means 31 adapted to circulate lubricating oil to the respective gear trains. Preferably, interconnecting means 33 are provided to connect the respective individual sumps, and valve means 32, 35 are adapted to maintain a flow of lubricating oil in the event of a loss of oil from one of the sumps.
