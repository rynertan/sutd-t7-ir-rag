# Cigarette filter assembly.

## Abstract
A cigarette filter assembly 10 has a non porous wrap per comprising a pair of wrappings 18, 20 and attaching the assembly to the tobacco cylinder 12 of the cigarette, the wrapper surrounding a filter plug 14 adjacent the tobacco cylinder and an open mixing chamber 24 between the filter plug and the distal end 22 of the filter assembly. The portion of the wrapper 18, 20 surrounding the mixing chamber 24 contains perforations 28 to allow the drawing in of diluting air to mix with the filtered smoke drawn into the mixing chamber through the filter plug 14 when the cigarette is smoked. The filter assembly is constructed to allow the smoke and diluting air to pass substantially unimpeded from the mixing chamber 24 through the distal end 22 into the smoker s mouth, either directly or through a hollow mouthpiece 26 or a very low flow resistance secondary filter 15 contained by the wrapper adjacent the distal end.
