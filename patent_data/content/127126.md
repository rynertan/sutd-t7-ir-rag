## Description
Sub for connection in a drill string THIS INVENTION relates te a sub for connection in a drill string between two stabilizers and generally to the use of such a sub in the drilling of well bores that are inclined from the vertical and, in particular. to control the rate of change of the inclination of the well bore ts it is being drilled. It is known that the rate of increase in the inclination of 2 well bore, usually measured in degrees per hundred feet, or per hundred metres, can be controlled to a great extent by placing a first stabilizer in the drill string. near the bit and a second stabilizer it the drili string spaced above the first stabilizer by a predetermined distance. Calculations can then be made, based upon the distance between the stabilizers, the bouyant effect of the drilling mud, the weight of the drill collars, the weight to be run on the bit, and the inclination of the well bore, to obtain a reasonably good indication of the rate at which continued drilling will Incraase the deviation of the well bore from the vertical. i.e., the rate at which the bit will build angle.Changes in the drilling angle occur because the drill collars bend between the stabilizers, due to the force of gravity and the axial compressive load placed on the drill collars to provide the weight on the bit. The easiest vsriable of this group to control accurately is the distance between the stabilizers. Weight on the bit can, of course, be adjusted but this may mean sacrificirlg rate of penetration which is undesirable. Based on these calculations the bottom hole assembly is made up with the stabilizers at the desired spacing and drilling proceeds. However, the rate that the bit builds angle under actual drilling conditions often turns out to be something different from what was expected from the calculations. When this happens, the directional driller has several options. He can adjust the weight on the bit. If the weight is reduced, the rate of penetration is correspondingly reduced, which means wasted time. Or he can remove the bottom hole assembly and adjust the spacing of the stabilizers which means a substantial loss of time and often leads to the replacement of a bit before it has served iLs useful life. Neither of these options are desirable. It is an object of the present invention at least to mitigate the problems associated with prior art drill string configurations. Accordingly. the invention provides a sub adapted for connection in a drill string between a first stabilizer and a second stabilizer. which sub comprises an outer member and an inner member in telescoping relationship. an annular space being formed between the members. with one member connectable to an upper portion of the drill string and the other member connectable to the lower portion of the drill string protuberance means on one of the members extending into the annular space between the members towards the adjacent surface of the other member and receiving means on the adjacent surface of the other member.adapted selectively to receive and engage said protuberance means such that the members are movable axially relative to one another, for substantially the whole of their telescoping stroke, when the protuberance means are disengaged from the receiving means. the receiving means being adapted to receive the protuberance means when the members are rotated relatively in one direction and to engage the protuberance means to prevent further relative rotation of the members in said one direction. thus allowing torquf to be transmitted in said one direction whilst allowing only limited relative axial movement of the members enabling weight to be transmitted from one member to the other, the arrangement permitting the distance between the stabilizers to be adjusted without removing the drill string from the well bore. Desirably. the protuberance means comprises a plurality of pins mounted in the wall of one of said members to extend into the annular space to a position adjacent the surface of the other member. In this case, the receiving means may define a cavity having an opening in one side through which a said pin can move into the cavity in said one direction. said cavity having a first end wall shaped to engage the pin and thus to allow longitudinal force to be transmitted from one member to the oiler and a side wall opposite to the opening to hold the pin from further rotation relative to the cavity to allow torque to be transmitted between the members in said one direction. Preferably, the receiving means are formed in an elongate narrow plate extending longitudinally along the surface of said member and attached thereto. Conveniently, the plate has a plurality of longitudinally spaced receiving means opening laterally to one side of the plate to allow the protuberance means mounted on the other member to enter the receiving means when the members are rotated relatively in said one direction to stop further rotation in said direction so that torque can be transmitted between the members in said direction and to limit longitudinal movement to allow force to be transmitted longitudinally between the members in at least one direction. Embodiments of the invention thus provide an adjustable sub for placing in the drill collar section of the drill string between the first stabilizer and the second stabilizer that will allow the distance between the stabilizers to be adjusted without having to remove the drill string from the well bore. The adjustable drilling sub has been found to enable the distance between the stabilizers to be adjusted, while the drill string is in the well bore and yet is capable of transmitting torque and weight on the bit as if it was a solid member in the drill string. In order that the invention may be more readily understood, and so that further features thereof may be appreciated, a drilling sub of the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIGURE 1 is a view partly in elevation and partly in section. of a section of a drill string assembly that includes an adjustable drilling sub of the invention in an inclined well bore FIGURES 2A. 2B. and 2C are views, partly in section and partly in elevation, of a preferred ernbodiment of adjustable drilling sub of this invention and FIGURE 3 is a view on an enlarged scale taken along the line 3 3 of Figure 2B. In Figure 1 a section of a typical drill string assembly is shown in an inclined well bore 10. The assembly includes a drill bit 12, shown in engagement with the bottom of the well bore, a first. bit, stabilizer 14, postioned adjacent the bit 12. a second. string, stabilizer 16. spaced from the first stabilizer by drill collars 18 and 20 and an adjustable length sub 22 of this invention. As explained above, the rate that the drill bit 12 will increase the inclination of well bore 10 will depend upon some known and preselected factors and some that are unknown.The known factors are the inclination of the well bore at a given location, the weight that is intended to be applied to the drill bit. the weight of the drill collar assembly the density of the drilling mud, and the length, L. between the first stabilizer 19 and the second stabilizer 16. Using these known factors, the angle the drill bit will tend to make with the bottom of the well bore that will tend to increase or build the angle the well bore makes with the vertical can be calculated. One factor that cannot be predetermined accurately is the gauge of the well bore where the stabilizers will be located.If the bore at the stabilizers is substantially in gauge. as tends to be the case when drilling through hard consolidated formations, the stabilizers will tend to resist the bending of the drill collars between the stabilizers and thereby tend to reduce the rate that the drilling bit builds angle. On the other hand, if the bore is out of gauge. as frequently happens in less consolidated formations, the ability of the stabilizers to resist the effect of the bending of the drill collars is reduced and the rate at which the bit builds angle is generally increased. Knowledge of the formations through which the bore is being drilled allows the directional driller to anticipate such conditions and to make allowances for them. The provision of the adjustable length sub 22 connected into the drill string between the first and second stabilizers allows the distance. wL . between the stabilizers to be adjusted to change the rate that the drill biL builds angle as required to keep the bit drilling along the intended p.,til of tlic well bore.Onu pre ferried adjustable length sub 22 is shown iri Fiqures 2 , 2B and 2C.The sub 22 cotnpriscs an outer annular member 4 and an inncr tubular member 26 that extends into and is in tell scoping reIttionship with the outer member. The outer member 24 is made up in two sections 24a and 24b for case of manufacture and asserrlbly. The two sections are connected together by threads 28. kn upper end of the inner member 25 extends into the bore of section 24a of the outer member and is connected to a wash pipe 30 through a threaded connection 32.The wash pipe carrics on its outer surface packing rings 34 that are spaced apart by spacer rings 36. The packing and spacer rings are held in place on the outer surface of the wash pipe 30 by a gland nut 38. The packing rings 34 fit closely within the annular member 2 ia to prevent drilling fluid that is pumped down to the bit, through the adjustable sub 22, from escaping to the annulus.The wash pipe 30 also presents a downwardly facing shnulder 40 that can engage an upwardly facing shoulder 42 formed on the upper end of section 24b of the cuter member to make sure that the inner member 26 is not inadvertently dropped into the well bore when, as will be explained below, the two members are rotated to a position allowing relative longitudinal movement therebetween. The distance between the shoulders 40 and 42 should be sufficient to allow the sub to be adjusted in length over the full range of adjustment desired for the tool. One of the members is provided with protrusions that extend into an annular space LfO formed between the members 24,26 and the other member is provided with cavities to receive the protrusions. Cooperation between the protrusions and the cavities acts to limit relativc rotation and relative axial movement between the members when the protrusions are located in the cavities and to allow relative longitudinal movement of the members when the protrusions are not located in the cavities. In the illustrated embodiment the lower section 24b Figure 2B has a plurality of drive pins 46 that extend through hoies in the wall of the section 24b of the outer member into the annular space tIB between the outer member 24 and inner member 26.Parallel rows of pins 46 are provided about the wall of the section 24b, aligned with the longitudinal axis of the sub and spaced apart at 90 intervals. The drive pins tiG are welded in place. Cavities to receive the drive pins 46 are formed on the outer surface of inner member 25 by elongate strips 50. The strips 50 are welded in place on the inner member 25, as shown in Figure 2C, in spaced, parallel.positions. The strips 50 have to be spaced apart angularly at the same spacing as the rows of pins LIS, which in this case is 90 Therefore, there will be four rows of pins Lt6 and four strips 50. A number of cavities 52 are formed in each strip 50 at positions to correspond with drive pins 48. Each cavity is substantially Cshaped in profile, each presenting a side wall 52a. a curved lower end wall 52b. a curved upper end wall 52c. and an opening 55 opposite to the side wall 52a. Since most drill strings have right hand threads, and the bit is consequently rotated to the right during a drilling operation, the cavities 52 are designed to transmit right hand rotation from the drill string to the drill bit 12. The relative positions of a drive pin Lf6 and an associated cavity 52 is shown in Figure 3. wherein the drive pin 46 is engaged with the side wall 52a to transmit torque in the direction of arrow 54 that will cause the inner member to rotate to the right. The pin 46 is also in contact with the curved lower end wall 52b of the cavity and thus acts to transmit the downward force, provided by the weight of the drill collars, to the drill bit. Generally, when the drill string is assembled at the surface. a preselected distance between the stabilizers will desirably locate the drive pins about midway between the upper and lower limits of the stroke of the sub. When the drill string is being inserted into the bore, the weight of the drill collars below the sub. together with the bit and the first stabilizer. will be supported on the drive pins 45 in engagement with upper end walls 52c of each cavity 52. Both end walls of the cavities have the same radius of curvature as the pins 116 to provide a solid engagement between the pin and the end surfaces. The drive pin should generally stay in the cavity selected.Should the bit encounter a bridge as it is being lowered into the well bore, the pin LfB will be caused to move downwardly into engagement with lower end wall 52b so that the bridge can be drilled out or broken through. At that time, the pin will move upwardly into engagement with upper end surface 52c end continue to support the portion of the drilling assembly hanging below. The same movement of the pins between the lower and upper end surfaces of the cavities wall will occur when a connection is made. If during a drilling operation, the directional driller notices such an increase or decrease in the rate of build angle that could create 2 problem, he can recalculate the distance L that is required to provide the desired build angle, and can adjust the length of the sub 22 as appropriate. This is done by lowering the outer member with the drill string and the drill bit resting on the bottom untii drive pins 46 are positioned laterally of the opening 56 of each respective cavity 52. A slight left hand rotation will then move the drive pins 46 into a space 58 between the metal strips 50 in which the cavities are located. This space is best seen in Figure 2C. The length between the stabilizers can then be adjusted by either raising or lowering the drill string the desired distance.When the drill string has been moved to achieve the desired change in the length of the sub 22, the string is then rotated to the right causing each drive pin QÏ to move back into a respective new cavity 52. The pins may not be exactly in position to enter openings 56 and it may require some slight adjustment in the position of the drill string to move the pins into the cavities. Once this is done. drilling can be commenced with the new spacing between the stabilizers. The process may need to be repeated on a trial and error basis if the desired build angle is not obtained. To assemble the sub, the inner member 26, without the wash pipe 30 attached, is moved through the section 24b of the outer member 24, with the drive pins 46 positioned to move along the longitudinal spaces, 5B between elongate metal strips 50, until the upper end of the inner member is extending above section 2lib. The wash pipe 30 is then connected to the upper end of the inner member, the packing and gland nut installed, and upper section 24a of the outer member connected to the lower section. In this condition, the sub is ready for connection in the drill string. The features disciosed in the foregoing desccription in the following claims and or in the accompanying drawings may. both separately and in any combination thereof. be material for realising the invention in diverse forms thereof.
