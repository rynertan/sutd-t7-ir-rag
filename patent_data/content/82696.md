# Controlling the flow of articles in combinatorial weighing apparatus.

## Abstract
A combinatorial weighing apparatus comprises a plurality of weighing machines, a dispersing table, and a plurality of supply troughs 18 extending from the dispersing table to the respective weighing machines for conveying thereto quantities of articles to be weighed, which articles are delivered to the supply troughs 18 by way of the dispersing table when the apparatus is in use flow regulating plates 20 extend respectively within the said supply troughs and are selectively movable therein, thereby to improve the flow of such articles along the troughs 18 when the apparatus is in use.
