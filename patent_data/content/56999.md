# METHOD OF TREATMENT FOR SEPARATION OF OIL FROM OIL CONTAINING SLURRY WASTE

## Abstract
An oil containing slurry waste containing a soap compo nent in the oil component thereof is foamed by stirring so that the oil component adheres to the froth produced by the foaming and rising to the surface of the slurry waste by virtue of buoyancy. Consequently, the oil component in the slurry waste is separated from the slurry waste in a highly concentrated form as entrained by the froth. The oil thus separated suits reuse. The slurry waste having a low oil content can be easily treated for disposal.
