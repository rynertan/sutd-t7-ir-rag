# Method of generating circuit boards using electroeroded sheet layers and circuit boards so produced.

## Abstract
By use of an electroerosion technique a plurality of conductive lines are isolated out of an electrically conduc tive layer supported on an isolating substrate of a sheet 1 having holes in a distinct pattern. Several sheets 1 are superimposed in different planes and are alternately mixed with inerplane spacer connector layers 24 between a ter minal block 32 and a pressing guide block 33 . The inter plane spacer connector layer 24 contains connectors 26 with contact areas 27, 28 interconnected with each other and make contact with isolated zones in different superim posed planes of sheets 1 . The terminal block 32 is provided with sockets 35 for holding the terminals of circuit components of the to be developed electrical circuit.
