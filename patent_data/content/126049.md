# Water closet system having a liquid separator.

## Abstract
A water closet system comprising a lavatory which is connected to a collection tank or mouldering chamber 2 over a discharge piping 3 , and a liquid separator 4 intercon nected in said discharge piping 3 adjacent and above the tank or chamber 2 . The liquid separator 4 comprises an inlet pipe 8 having a widened bottom portion 13 , an outlet pipe 9 preferably having a widened top portion 14 and a liquid container which sealingly encloses at least the end portions 13, 14 of said inlet and outlet pipes 8, 9 . The diameter D2 of the top end 14 of the outlet pipe 9 is equal to of larger than the diameter D1 of the non widened portion of the inlet pipe 8 , and the said diameter D3 of the bottom end 13 of the inlet pipe 8 is larger than said diameter D2 of the top portion 14 of the outlet pipe 9 . The discharge piping 3 may be connected peripherally to the inlet pipe 8 of the liquid separator, and the inlet pipe 8 may have several wires provided spaced round the periphery thereof and extending down towards the centre of the outlet pipe 9 for guiding solid and semi solid material received from the inlet pipe 8 to the centre of the outlet pipe 9 .
