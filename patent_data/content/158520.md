# LOAD BREAK SWITCH WITH SAFETY MECHANISM

## Abstract
A single phase ground enclosed load break switch for distribution voltages has a hermetically sealed cylindrical metal housing 210 of from 2 to 6 inches diameter which contains an insulating gas under pressure. The switch has a movable contact assembly to contact a pair of opposed stationary coaxial conductors with the housing. A rocking bellows 266 at the fulcrum of a crank actuator 264 provides a compact hermetic seal for the actuator without excessive strain of the bellows. A safety interlock 302,310,260 with a visual indicator 318,320 locks the contact assembly in case of a loss of pressure. Excessive pressure in the switch causes the bellows 266 to be punctured with consequent locking of the contact assembly. The switch is small enough to be mounted directly on a transformer or placed into a cable, without the need for a separate enclosure.
