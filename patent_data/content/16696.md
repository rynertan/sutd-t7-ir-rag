# Coin detecting apparatus.

## Abstract
A coin, spurious coin and the like 11 is passed in close proximity with the inductance L1 of the resonant tank circuit of an oscillator and varies the losses of the tank circuit and thereby the amplitude of a signal produced by the oscillator in accordance with the metal content of the coin, and the like. The signal produced by the oscillator is converted to a control signal having an amplitude which when in a predetermined range indicates an acceptable coin and which when outside the range indicates a retectable spurious coin, and the like. After passing the inductance, the coin is selectively directed to an accepted location 19 or a rejected location 18 in accordance with the amplitude of the control signal.
