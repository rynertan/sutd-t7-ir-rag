## Description
Diagnostic Activated Partial Thromboplastin ReagentFieid of the InventionThe present invention relates to the field of diagnostic coagulation testing and more specifically this invention provides a partial thromboplastin reagent with a nonsettling surface contact Factor XII activator.Background of the InventionHemostasis is a complicated life saving procedure involving blood vessels, plasma, platelets, vessel walls, neural and humoral activity, all for the purpose of stanching bleeding. Although there has been much research, especially within the last few decades, concerning the process of coagulation specifically and hemostasis in general, there is much that is not completely understood particularly with regard to the specific details concerning the interaction of contributing mechanisms. For instance, it is now known that there are no less than 35 compounds which take part in the formation of a firm blood clot. Ostensibly, blood coagulation is thus one of the more complicated chemical processes occurring within the body.In fact, there are so many separate components within the scheme of coagulation that the InternationalCommittee on Nomenclature for Blood Coagulation formed by the International Hematology Congress has adopted a series of names which have now come into general acceptance. The most common of these names with generally employed alternatives and factor designations include the following Factor I Fibrinogen Factor II Prothrombin Factor III Thromboplastin Factor IV Calcium Factor V Proaccelerin, labile factor Factor VI no longer used Factor VII Serum prothrombin conversion accelerator SPCA , stable factor Factor VIII Antihemophilic factor AHF Factor IX Christmas factor, plasma thromboplastin component PTC Factor X Stuart Factor, Stuart Prower factor Factor XI Plasma thromboplastin antecedent PTA Factor XII Hageman factor Factor XIII Fibrin stabilizing factor Profibrinolysin Plasminogen Fibrinolysin PlasminDiagnostic determination of the presence and quantitation of various of the above factors is important as many clinically relevant diseases associated with abnormal clotting are associated therewith.For instance, the absence of Factor VIII is the most frequent and serious cause of genetically determined clotting defects such as hemophilia A which has been recognized for over 2,000 years. A deficiency in plasma concentration of Factor IX is generally associated with the genetically determined defect responsible for hemophilia B. Hemorrhagic disease results from deficiencies in Factors X and XI whereas deficiencies in Factor XII induce longer clotting times but still permit eventual clotting. Diseases of the liver or Vitamin K deficiencies have also been associated with abnormal levels of clotting Factors II, VII, IX, and X as these are predominantly produced by the liver.Other causes of abnormal clotting may be related to reduced platelet counts, thrombocytopenia, often associated with pernicious anemia, certain drug therapies, irradiation or increased peripheral destruction by antibodies.The clinical value of testing for coagulation times is not limited to the detection of genetic or pathological disease states but is also useful in the regulation of anticoagulant therapy. Anticoagulants typically inhibit the coagulation mechanism such as by the heparin mediated inhibition of Factor X by Antithrombin III. Deficiencies in the clotting mechanisms due to congenital defects, pathological conditions, or anticoagulation therapy have been discussed generally in Chapter 7, Coagulation andHemostasis by Robert D. Langdell, In Clinical Diagnosis,Davidson and Henry, 1979.As commonly understood, coagulation may occur by two pathways, the so called intrinsic pathway and extrinsic pathway. The former is generally triggered by the presence of a surface thought to activate Factor XII and, with the presence of phospholipids and calcium, through a number of steps eventually stimulates the formation of a stabilized fibrin clot. The partial thromboplastin time PTT test typically measures the intrinsic pathway wherein most congenital deficiencies occur. Consequently this type of test serves as an excellent presurgical coagulation screening test however, since the reagent employed in this test is typically a platelet substitute, the PTT test does not measure platelet activity.The extrinsic pathway is generally triggered by injury to tissue and the resultant exudation of tissue thromboplastin acts on Factors VII and X which, following a series of steps, thereafter forms a fibrin clot. The extrinsic pathway is generally tested by the so called one stage prothrombin time test to thereby detect most of the factors depressed by oral anticoagulant drugs for anticoagulant therapy control. The thrombin time test typically measures the quantity and reactivity of fibrinogen. This test is a rapid, semiquantitative test and is consequently the test of choice for intravascular clotting and fibrinolysis analysis. The above is presented in review in accompanying Table I as well as a booklet entitled Concentric Concepts of Coagulation 1971, 1975 available from Ortho Diagnostics, Inc., Raritan, New Jersey.

Perhaps because of its apparently simpler nature in connection with more readily discernible initiation causes i.e., injury, the mechanisms involved in the extrinsic pathway were more susceptible to understanding than those involved with the intrinsic pathway. For instance, as late as 1957, in an article by J. Margolis entitled Initiation of Blood Coagulation by Glass and RelatedSurfaces appearing in the Journal of Physiology, 137,95109 1957 , it was clear that there was still much to be learned concerning the win vitro mechanisms. It was observed that the contact of various surfaces with plasma including platelet poor plasma resulted in plasma clotting. The Margolis study reported findings regarding clotting time versus platelets per cubic millimeter versus contact surface and attempted to draw conclusions therefrom.It was noted that by providing an artificial surface such as glass, shortened clotting times could be observed. Other particulate activators have been employed in addition to glass and these include colloidal silica, celite, kaolin, and ellagic acid. Reagents containing these particular activators have been described in an article by Babson et al., Comparative Evaluation of aPartial Thromboplastin Reagent Containing a Nonsettling,Particulate Activator A.J.C.P. 62, 856 860 December 1974 . That article stressed the greater sensitivity involved with the use of colloidal silica. Further information regarding the use of kaolin as an activator may be obtained by reference to Margolis, The Kaolin ClottingTime , J. Clin. Path. 11,406 409 1959 . Still another diagnostic reagent actually a PTT reagent has employed cholanic acid and a water soluble heavy metal salt and is described in U.S. Patent No. 3,983,004 to Trobiesh et al.Still another reagent, described by Lena Han et al. inU.S. Patent No. 3,395,210, utilizes bentonite and diatomaceous earth particles. These reagents, employing activators for reducing the clotting time of normal plasma, have generally suffered from inherent defects making it necessary for technicians to exercise great care in order to obtain reproducible results. For instance, those agents employing siliceous materials require thorough agitation prior to each use in order to avoid the otherwise rapid settling of the silica from the saline suspension. Further, these tests tend not to lend themselves to automated optical systems due to the opacity of such suspensions. See for explanation and review, Canadian Patent No. 812,215 to Baker et al. That patent attempted to avoid the problems associated with particulate activators by employing ellagic acid. Such a product, Activated THROMBOFAX Reagent Optimized is presently available from Ortho Diagnostic Systems Inc.,Raritan, New Jersey and is further described in U.S.Patent No. 3,486,981 to Speck. Still further explanation may be had regarding the activation of Factor XII by solutions containing ellagic acid by reference to Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine, Volume 63, No. 3 359375 March 1964 entitled Activation of Hageman Factor bySolutions of Ellagic Acid by Ratnoff et al.While the Ortho Activated THROMBOFAXw Reagent in its optimized state works well, it is an object of the present invention to provide a silica activated partial thromboplastin reagent having superior sensitivity to heparinized plasma in the therapeutic range and to factor deficient plasmas.Diagnostic reagents employing fumed silica as an activator are not new. See, for instance, U.S. Patent No. 3,880,714 to Babson as well or the product package insert forAutomated APTT available from General Diagnostics. TheBabson invention was claimed to represent an advance over prior silica particles due to the elimination of constant stirring in order to maintain suspension of the particles.It should, however, be carefully noted that the Babson reagent employs a fumed silica particle as the critical activator substance. It is an object of the present invention to also obviate the need of any type of resuspending activities without relying on fumed silica particles.Studies attempting to explain the mechanism of silica stimulated activation as well as comparisons of silica effectiveness on weight basis have been described byMargolis, Some Physical Aspects of Plasma Surface Reactions in PROC. of Eighth International Congress ofHematology, Tokyo, Volume 3, 1962, Pages 672 673. Other studies relating to the effectiveness on coagulation of granules in general, including silica specifically, based on particle size are reported by Margolis in TheEffective Colloidal Silica on Blood Coagulation , Aust. J.Exp. Biol. 39 249 258 1961 . It has been discovered by the inventors hereof that the silica particles need not be fumed and in fact, it has been found preferable to use nonfumed silica particles in order to meet another object of the present invention, that of providing a reagent with an improved precision and optimal normal clotting time than those presently available.Brief Summary of the InventionIn accordance with the principles and objects of the present invention, there are provided diagnostic partial thromboplastin reagents containing rabbit or bovine brain phospholipids for optimal platelet activity and a nonfumed colloidal silica as the Factor XII activator as well as clot enhancers, suspending reagents and stabilizers in the preferred embodiments.The preferred reagent comprises ether acetone extracted rabbit or bovine cephalin, distilled water, HEPES Buffer, nonfumed colloidal silica having a particle size in the range of about 12 60 nm, and a surface area in the range of about 50 230 m2 g, manganous chloride and glycine.Detailed Description of the Invention and Best ModeIn accordance with the objects and principles of the present invention, there are provided reagents for diagnostically testing and evaluating the intrinsic coagulation pathway having superior shelf lifes. These reagents are generally optically clearer than those previously available thereby lending themselves to greater usefulness in instruments which measure optical density changes. As the reagents are preferably to be offered in liquid form, the avoidance of errors and contamination occurring with the reconstitution of lyophilized products is realized.Additionally, the reagents yield faster normal clotting times thereby providing increased precision as well as increased sensitivity to heparinized plasma.As has been previously intimated, the exposure of human plasma to glass, kaolin, celite, or other negatively charged surfaces initiates contact activation which triggers the intrinsic coagulation pathway. When bound, theHageman Factor Factor XII is 500 times more susceptible to cleavage by proteases than when solubilized within the plasma. Thus, it is presumed that the surfaces promote activation of the Hageman Factor indirectly by altering its structure thereby making it more susceptible to plasma proteases. Based on the above theory, the inventors believe, without wishing to be held to such belief, that the increased sensitivity to Hageman Factor deficiencies by the instant invention may be traced to the provision of increased surface area by the employment of nonfumed colloidal silica.Such a nonfumed colloidal silica is available from DuPont under the name Ludoxe and, it has been found preferable to employ the wpa a grade of the Ludoxe colloidal silica as well as from other sources.The WPa Ludoxe colloidal silica as described by DuPont, has a negative particle charge with an average diameter of 22 nm and a specific surface area of 140 square meters per gram. The particle is further characterized as FIO2 35 weight percent, pH 10.7 at 25C, 0.62 weight percent titratable alkali as Na2O, 55 FIO2 by weight, 0.02 weight percent of chlorides, 0.05 weight percent of sulfates, and a viscosity of 4cP. Pursuant to DuPont s brochure, this grade of colloidal silica is listed as a polishing agent for silicon wafers. The DuPont material has ideally been employed as it comes from the reagent bottle in a concentration range of about 0.04 .4 percent with an optimal concentration being approximately 0.08 percent of the final formulation.It has been preferable to include an activity enhancer such as manganous chloride in the range of approximately 0.2 4 percent of a 0.1 molar solution with the optimal range ideally in the range of about 1.2 2 percent of the final concentration. Again, without wishing to be held to theory, the present inventors believe that the double positive charge on the manganous acts to bring the cephalin and the silica in closer proximity causing the silica to be more effective in activating the Factor XII.Alternatively, other activity enhancers such as magnesium chloride, aluminum chloride, and barium chloride have been tested and found effective in substitution for manganous chloride. Other double or triplely charged cations occurring across the same rows in the periodic table of elements such as copper chloride, nickel chloride, zinc chloride, and chromium chloride although untried, may be expected to be equally effective and advantageously employed in substitution.In order to provide an optimal pH for maximizing effectiveness of the reagent, an organic buffer is employed such as the HEPES Buffer n 2 Hydoethylpiperazine n 2ethane sulfonic acid . Ideally the HEPES Buffer will be employed in the final concentration range of approximately 0.025 M 0.22 M and a pH in the range of approximately 7 to 8. The preferred embodiment of the present invention employs HEPES Buffer having a final concentration of approximately 0.1 M and a pH of about 7.5 in order to effectuate optimal activation.Alternative embodiments may employ in substitution for the HEPES Buffer the following BES Buffer N, N bis 2 hydroxyethyl 2 arninoethane sulfonic acid or BICINE Buffer N,N bis 2Hydroxyethylglycine , or MOPS Buffer Morholinopropane sulfonic acid or TES Buffer N Tris hydroxymethyl methyl 2 aminoethane sulfonic acid , or PIPES Buffer Piperazinen,n bis 2 ethane sulfonic acid all preferably adjusted in order to maximize stability at approximately a 50 50 equilibrium of disassociated nondisassociated forms.The plateletlike activity is provided preferably by a phospholipid such as rabbit or bovine brain cephalin extract, however, other sources such as plant tissues for example, soybean lecithin and animal tissues for example, lung and nervous tissue and highly vascularized organs may also be advantageously employed in substitution. These phospholipids are typically ether acetone extracted in accordance with well known techniques.Typically, the extract component comprises a 1.3 percent cephalin suspension mixed with 0.8 percent sodium chloride and preferably 1 to 10,000 parts of thimerosal as a preservative, however, other preservatives may be equally or more effective. The cephalin is ideally adjusted to have a final concentration in the reagent in the range of about 0.25 10 percent with the preferred optimal concentration as 2.0 percent of the final solution.The reagent further comprises a suspending reagent for preventing the settling out of the activity enhancers.Such a suspending reagent is glycine which preferably provided in a final concentration in the range of about 4 to 5 percent. Also included within the reagent of the present invention will be distilled water or triple deionized water as appropriate in order to make up the volume to provide the above specified concentration ranges.A comparison of the clotting times exhibited among OrthoActivated THROMOBFAXt optimized , General DiagnosticsAutomated APTT the fumed silica preparation , and the nonfumed colloidal silica and rabbit or bovine cephalin reagent of the present invention is presented in the accompanying Table II.That Table provides information concerning the clotting times of plasma having from 0 to 0.6 units of heparin per ml as well as the relative effectiveness with various deficiencies in Factors VII I, IX, X,XI, Fletcher and Ortho Abnormal Plasma Coagulation Control APCC . To be noted is that although faster times are generally preferable than longer times, a time that is too fast such as the 77 seconds exhibited by the Ortho Activated THROMBOFAX in 0.6 units heparinized plasma provides a standard curve that is relatively flat and therefore felt by many to be difficult to interpret.Thus, the rabbit cephalin, nonfumed colloidal silica reagent of the present invention is the most preferred embodiment as it provides optimal clotting times which are neither too fast nor too slow thereby exhibiting superior sensitivity.
