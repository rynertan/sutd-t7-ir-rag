# Process and equipment for determining or influencing the flow properties of solid granular materials.

## Abstract
By the application of the process and equipment accord ing to the invention flow properties of solid granular materials can be determined even while producing or processing and by means of the intervening signals derived from measuring results, production and processing can be influenced. Either in the mass proportional or in the time proportional mode of operation, changing one of the para meters in each cycle, the sample medium is allowed to pass through the sample holder 101 and using the mass signal and period signal thus obtained partly the signal of mass flow, partly the signal of the density of mass flow is generated, and from said signals based on the recognized new correlation any of the parameters characterizing the technological process is generated by signal processing. The equipment is provided with a sample holder 101 with changeable geometry, to the corresponding points of which a type signal transmitter 102 and an aperture signal transmitter 103 are connected. Below the sample holder a mass signal transmitter 109 is arranged. The equipment has an electronic signal processing unit 111 with at least one function generator and to the input s of said unit the outputs of the type signal transmitter 102 , the aperture signal transmitter 103 , a period signal transmitter 107 , the mass signal transmitter 109 and a device 108 observing the path are connected.
