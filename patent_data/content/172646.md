# Stretched multilayer polypropylene films.

## Abstract
A stretched multilayer polypropylene film comprises a stretched crystalline polypropylene layer having laminated on at least one side therof, a layer comprising a homo or co polymer composed mainly of ethylene, propylene or butene 1 and having a melting point of 150 C or less, and 0.05 wt ppm to 10 wt calculated as vinylcycloalkane units of a vinylcycloalkane polymer, particularly vinylcyclohexane. This composite film has greatly improved optical properties such as transparency without loss of its good heat sealabil ity, and is very useful for wrapping.
