# Load transfer device and system.

## Abstract
A system for securing a life line 20 around the outside of a structure, e.g., the wheelhouse of a boat, includes at tachment devices for the life line at intermediate positions therealong particularly at corner parts of said structure which allow a hook of a safety line attached for sliding movement to the life line, to pass those attachment points. In one embodiment each attachment device comprises a recessed wheel 10 and a slipper member 14 located to embrace tip portions of the wheel projections 11 to be held thereby while allowing rotation of the relative to the slipper member. In this way the slipper member guides the line 20 in an arcuate path around a peripheral part of the wheel house to allow a hook 31 engaged for sliding movement along the life line to traverse the attachment point by en gaging in a recess 12 in the wheel which then rotates rela tive to the slipper member 14 to pass the hook 31 through the attachment device.
