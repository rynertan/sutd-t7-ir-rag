# Speed sprouting apparatus and method.

## Abstract
An apparatus for hydroponically sprouting seeds in an ar tificial environment and in the same individual containers used to distribute the sprouts to consumers includes a plurality of perforated seed germinating and sprout growing bags 28 . The bags 28 , which contain seeds to be sprouted, are initially suspended from sets of portable racks 26 which are placed in circular tiers on circular, partially translucent structures 22 . The tray structures 22 are supported in spaced vertical rela tionship by an upright mast 24 located within an enclosed housing 20 and adapted to rotate about its longitudinal axis. Periodically, filtered and anti bacterially treated irrigation water is supplied to each bag 28 at a fast enough rate to thoroughly mix the seeds located therein. Water draining from the bags 28 is collected in a storage tank 32 and subsequently re cycled after first being filtered and purified. Once the seeds have sprouted, artificial light is provided so that substantially all the sprouts in each bag 28 receive an uniform amount of growing light.
