# MAGNETIC BUBBLE DOMAIN DEVICE PACKAGE AND METHOD OF ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A magnetic bubble domain device package and method of assembly thereof in which an integral rigid carrier is con figured for receiving a magnetic bubble domain device chip and provides a frame for directly winding the drive coils thereon. The carrier also includes predetermined positions for the placement of bias magnets so as to obtain a uniform bias field directed at a predetermined angle with respect to the chip. The rigid carrier is preferably injection molded to provide highly precise dimensions and placement of the var ious components of the package.
