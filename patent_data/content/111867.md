# Cooking vessel of stainless steel for all types of heat sources.

## Abstract
Cooking vessel of austenitic stainless steel 1 which in addition to being able to be heated on a conventional electric hotplate or on gas, can also be heated by induction heating. This is made possible in that the vessel, in addition to a heat distributing plate 2 of aluminium or copper, is also equipped with a plate of magnetizable material 5 . This is affixed to the heat distributing plate by means of two or three intermediate layers 6, 7 of metal with coefficients of thermal expansion which lie between the corresponding coefficients for the heat distributing plate and the magnetiz able plate.
