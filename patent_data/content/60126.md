# Production of calcium hypochlorite.

## Abstract
Neutral calcium hypochlorite is made by producing and separating out from the mother liquor crystals of dibasic calcium hypochlorite reacting the dibasic calcium hypochlo rite with a solution free of insoluble impurities and contain ing hypochlorite ions to produce hemibasic calcium hypoch lorite crystals separating the crystals of hemibasic calcium hypochlorite from the mother liquor and converting the hemibasic calcium hypochlorite crystals into neutral calcium hypochlorite.
