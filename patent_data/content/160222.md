## Description
NOVEL NICKEL INDIUM ALLOY FOR USE IN THE MANUFACTURE OF A HERMETICALLY SEALED CONTAINER FOR SEMICONDUCTOR AND OTHER ELECTRONIC DEVICES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to a new and improved hermetically sealed container for semiconductor and other electronic devices. More particularly, this invention relates to such a container designed and intended to hermetically seal electronic devices, such as semiconductor integrated circuit devices and the like. This invention also relates to a novel sealing cover for use in fabricating the above referenced hermetically sealed container, and to a novel process for manufacturing said container and cover.2. Prior Art The majority of semiconductor integrated circuit devices are housed in hermetically sealed packages commonly referred to as dual in line, flatpack, and hybrid packages. Several designs of such packages are now in use. Among these is one which consists of a ceramic base, a cover, a lead frame, and solder glass for sealing the frame between the base and the cover, known in the trade as the CERDIP Trademark package.Another package type consists of a lead frame sandwiched between layers of a glass ceramic mixture. A cavity is left in one of the layers and the semiconductor device is sealed into the cavity with a metal lid and solder preform. Premolded and transfer molded plastic packages are also used. One popular type of package is made from a single layer of ceramic having a screened, conductive lead frame pattern deposited on it, the terminal pins on the side of the package being brazed on to give a so called side brazes package. This type of package is also made with two layers of ceramic material with the screened conductive pattern sandwiched between the layers and ordinarily sealed with metal lids and metallic solder performs. A number of packages comprising hybrids of those described above are also in use. An especially effective hermetically sealed container for electronic devices is described and claimed in U.S. Patent No. 4,105,861. The container of this patent comprises a supporting pad for an electronic device, a conductive lead frame surrounding the pad and forming therewith a unitary construction, and a sheet of homogeneous epoxy resin extending over and fused to each face of the frame and its conductive leads, at least one of the sheets having an aperture dimensioned and disposed to surround the supporting pad and a portion of the adjacent leads of the lead frame.The container further comprises upper and lower cover plates of a material of the group comprising metal, ceramic, glass, and rigid plastic fused to the plastic sheets, one of such plates having an opening in registry with the aperture in the adjacent one of the plastic sheets for receiving an electronic device to be supported on the pad. The container further comprises means for hermetically sealing the opening in such one of the cover plates as for example a gold plated ROAR lid with a gold tin eutectic solder perform. In an alternative construction, the supporting pad for the electronic device is a portion of the lower cover plate in the form of an upwardly protruding pedestal and each of the plastic sheets has an aperture dimensioned and disposed to surround such supporting pad and a portion of the adjacent leads of the lead frame, the pedestal extending at least partially through the aperture of the adjacent one of the plastic sheets. While all of the above described packages are relative effective, they suffer from some inherent disadvantages. The most pervasive disadvantage is the expense of the container because of the high price of gold, and gold price volatility. For example, the thickness of thW gold plating on the KOVAR cover lid is specified as a winfinum thickness, typically fifty micrometers. Many millions of these lids are produced each year, and the cost of the gold used in plating the lids is several millions of dollars. Thus, it is an object of this invention to provide a new hermetically sealed package for electronic devices, as for example semi conductors, which is relatively low in cost. It is another object of this invention to provide an improved hermetic sealing means from such containers having reliable hermetic sealing properties. It is yet another object of this invention to provide a method of fabricating a hermetically sealed container for an electronic device as for example a semi conductor, and a method of fabricating hermetic sealing means for the cover. Other objects will be apparent from the following descriptioni taken in connection with the accompanying drawings. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with this invention, there is provided an improvement in a hermetic sealing cover for a container for an electronic device of the type which comprises a conductive cover element, the improvement comprises a cover element plated with nickel indium alloy containing at least 0.1 weight percent indium based on the total weight of the alloy.This invention also relates to an improved hermetically sealed container for electronic devices of the type having a body with a cavity with an opening, means for supporting one or more electronic devices, one or more electronic devices supported by said supporting means, and hermetic sealing means in hermetically sealing engagement with said opening, the improvement comprising hermetic sealing means which comprises a conductive cover element plated with a nickel indium alloy containing at least 0.1 weight percent indium based on the total weight of the alloy disposed in registry with said opening and hermetically sealed thereto. Other aspects of this invention relate to a method of manufacturing the hermetic sealing cover and the hermetically sealed container of this invention. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a preferred apparatus for fabricating an hermetically sealed container including the fabrication of a sealing cover therefor. FIG. 2 is a perspective view of a preferred apparatus for attaching a performed solder ring to a cover for the container. FIG. 3 is a perspective exploded view of a preferred hermetically sealed semiconductor device incorporating the improvement of this invention. FIG. 4 is a perspective exploded view of a preferred hermetically sealed semi conductor device incorporating the improvement of this invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring now to the drawing, in FIG, 1 are represented, in schematic form, the three basic steps in fabricating an hermetically sealed container. In unit 10, a preformed sealing ring is attached to the cover, as described hereinafter. In unit 11, the cover ring unit is assembled with the body and in unit 12, which way be a baking oven, the temperature of the assembly is raised to a value at which the sealing ring is fused to the cover and to the body, completing the hermetic seal. Referring to FIG. 2, there is shown an apparatus suitable for performing the method of fabricating the hermetic sealing cover in accordance with the invention as represented schematically by unit 10 of FIG. 1. In this figure, a flat cover 13 with a superimposed heatfusible conductive ring 14 is disposed in a shallow cavity 15 of a nonconductive supporting member 16, the cavity having dimensions only slightly larger than those of the cover 13 and the ring 14 to secure registration between the ring 14 and the periphery of the cover.The cover 13 has a thickness preferably of the order of 0.010 inch t0.00254 cs while the ring 14 is typically, for example, a gold tin eutectic alloy and alloys which do not contain precious metals such as tin indium alloys, tin lead indium alloys, indium silver alloys, lead indium alloys and the like having a thickness of the order of 0.002 inch 0.000508 cm and the same outer dimensions as those of the cover 13. In the drawing, the thickness dimensions of the elements 13 and 14 are greatly enlarged for the sake of clarity. Cover 13 is composed of a conductive material plated with a nickel indium alloy containing at least 0.1 weight percent indium based on the total weight of the alloy. The thickness of the cover is preferably from 2.5 to 3.5 microns. Generally any conductive material known to those of skill in the art can be employed. Illustrative of useful conductive materials are alloys of base metals such as iron, cobalt, nickel, and the like. The preferred conductive materials for use in this invention are cobalt nickel iron alloys commercially available under the trademark KOVAR . In the preferred embodiments of this invention, the amount of indium in the alloy will vary from 0.1 to 50 weight percent indium by total weight of the alloy, and in the particularly preferred embodiments will vary from 5 to 20 weight percent indium on the same basis.Amongst these particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, alloys of this invention which contain from 10 to 15 weight percent of indium based on the total weight of the alloy are especially preferred for used in the manufacture of the cover of this invention, and those alloys in which the amount of indium is from 11 to 14 weight percent indium by weight of the alloy are most preferred for this application. Cover 13 can be manufactured employing conventional methods and techniques. In one embodiment, a strip of base metal, such as KOVAR, is plated with the nickel indium alloy to a fraction, as for example 408 to 90 , of the ultimate required minimum surface plating thickness which may be from 25 to 100 micrometers. Thereafter the strip is divided into cover elements of a predetermined size which are plated with the nickel indium alloy to provide a resultant minimum thickness which is of surface plating substantially equal to the required thickness usually from 29 to 100 micrometers, and preferably 50 micrometers. This method is described and claimed in U.S. Patent 4,284,081. Alternatively, cover elements of a pre determined size can be stamped out of a strip of base metal, such as KOVARQ and, thereafter plated with the nickel indium alloy to the desired thickness. In either case, the cover can be plated with nickel indium alloy to increase the thickness thereof, and thereafter plated with a material composed preponderantly of a precious metal, such as gold or gold alloys, to provide the required thickness. The nickel indium alloy for use in the practice of this invention can be prepared by electrodepositing same from a plating bath on to a conducting metal, as for example KOVAR, employing conventional electrodeposition techniques. Useful electrodeposition techniques include both barrel and rack plating. Such conventional techniques which are described in detail in Electroplating Engineering Handbook by A. KennethGrahams, Ed Van Nostrand Reinhold Co., NY, NY 1970 are well known in the electroplating art and will not be described herein in any great detail. In the preferred embodiments of this invention, the alloy is electroplating from the novel bath claimed in my co pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 605,352 entitled Novel Nickel Indium Alloy and Method of UsingSame in the Manufacture of Printed Circuit Boards , filed April 30, 1984. The novel bath of that invention comprises a at least 0.9M weight percent nickel cations and at least Q.O01M indium cations b up to 2.6 M chloride ions c from 0.25 M to 1.6 M of a buffer material selected from the group consisting of boric acid, hydroxy carboxylic acids and salts of such carboxylic acids and d water.In the preferred embodiments of this invention, the concentration of nickel cations and indium cations in the bath are from 0.9M to 2.5M, and from 0.001 to 1M, respectively. In the particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, the concentration of nickel cations and indium cations in the bath are from 0.5M to 2.0M, and from 0.009M to 0.lM, respectively. Amongst these particularly preferred embodiments, most preferred are those embodiments in which the concentration of nickel cations and indium cations in the bath are from 1M to 2M, and from 0.015M to 0.06M, respectively. The nickel and indium cations for use in the plating bath of this invention can be derived from any source. In the preferred embodiments of the invention, the nickel on indium cations are derived from nickel and or indium chloride, and water soluble nickel and or indium salts of sulfamic acid, hydroxycarboxylic acids and aminocarboxylic acids which do not contain mercapto functions. Illustrative of useful water soluble nickel and indium salts are the nickel and indium salts of citric acid, acetoacetic acid, glyoxylic acid, pyruric acid, glycolic acid, glyceric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, hydroxybutyric acid, arginine, aspartic acid, asparagine, gutamic acid, glycine, glutamine, leucine, lysine, threonine, isoleucine, valine, and the like.In the preferred embodiments of the invention, the nickel and indium salts of sulfamic acid are employed as the source of nickel and indium, and in the particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, nickel and indium salts of sulfamic acid are used as the sources of nickel and indium. The concentration of chloride ions in the bath is from 0 to 2.6M. The chloride ions may be obtained from any metal salt which will not electrodeposit under the operational conditions of the bath such as sodium and potassium chloride or from non metal salts such as ammonius chloride or from nickel or indium chloride.The chloride ions are preferably derived form indium and nickel chloride. In the preferred embodiments of the invention, the concentration of chloride ions in the bath is from 0.001M to 2.6M chloride ions, and in the particularly preferred embodiments, the concentration of chloride ions in the bath is from 0.005M to 1.6M chloride ions. Amongst these particularly preferred embodiments, most preferred are those embodiments in which the concentration of chloride ions in the bath is from 0.05M to 0.25M. The novel plating bath for use in the electrodeposition of the alloy includes from 0.2 to l.6M of a buffer material selected from the group consisting of boric acid and hydroxy carboxylic acid . As used herein, a hydroxy carboxylic acid is a carboxylic acid having one or more carboxylic acid functions and one or more hydroxy functions, and the salts of such acids.Illustrative of useful hydroxycarboxylic acids are glycolic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, citric acid, mandelic acid, ammonium citrate, sodium citrate, sodium tartarate, malic acid, glyceric acid and the like. Hydroxy carboxylic acids are preferred primarily because they provide for better control of the compositions of the electro deposited alloy. The preferred hydroxy carboxylic acids for use in the practice of this invention are citric acid, malic acid and ammonium citrate. In the preferred embodiments of the invention in which boric acid is the buffer material of choice, the concentration of buffer material in the bath is from 0.lem to 0.7M, and in those preferred embodiments of this invention in which a hydroxy carboxylic acid is the buffer material of choice the concentration of buffer material in the bath is from O.2M to l.3M. In the particularly preferred embodiments of this invention in which boric acid is the buffer material of choice, the concentration of buffer material in the bath may vary from 0.4M to 0.6M, and in those particularly preferred embodiments of this invention in which a hydroxy carboxylic acid is the buffer material of choice, the concentration of buffer material is from 0.2M to 1M.Amongst the particularly preferred embodiments, most preferred are those embodiments of the invention in which the concentration of boric acid in the bath is from 0.5M to 0.7M, or in which the concentration of the hydroxy carboxylic acid is from 0.2M to 0.7M. The bath of this invention may include other optional ingredients which are normally used with or incorporated into plating baths. For example, the plating bath of this invention may include one or more compounds to reduce surface pitting, such as alkyl sulfonic acid salts and the like. Other optional materials which may be included in the bath of this invention are dextrose type stabilizers for indium. The plating bath of this invention usually has a pH equal to or less than about 5, and preferably from 1.4 to 5.0. This preferred pH can be maintained by addition of boric acid when boric acid is used as the buffer material, or can be adjusted by addition of basic materials, such as ammonium hydroxide, nickel carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and the like, or adjusted by the hydroxy carboxylic acid, when a carboxylic acid is the buffer material of choice. The particular pH employed in the particularly preferred embodiments of the invention will depend on the particular buffer material used. For example where a hydroxy carboxylic acid, such as citric acid, is the buffer material of choice, the pH will generally vary from 1.4 to 4.7, and preferably from about 1.8 to about 3.8.In the particularly preferred embodiments of the invention where a carboxylic acid is used as the buffer material, the pH may vary from 2.0 to 2.8, and in the most preferred embodiments of the invention where a carboxylic acid is used as the buffer material, the pH may vary from 2.1 to 2.7. On the other hand, experimentation has shown that best results are obtained when boric acid is the buffer material of choice if the pE is maintained in the range of from 1.5 to 3.5. In the preferred embodiments of the invention where boric acid is the buffer material of choice, the pH may vary from 3.0 to 3.Q, and in the particularly preferred embodiments, the pH may vary from 2.5 to 3.0.In the most preferred embodiments of the invention in which boric acid is the buffer material of choice, the pH can vary from 2.8 to 3.0. An especially efficacious plating bath for use in the practice of this invention comprises a from O.9M to 2.M of nickel ions b from 0.4M to 2.5 chloride ions c from 0.2M to 1M of a buffer material selected from the group consisting of boric acid hydroxycarboxylic acids and salts of such caboxylic acids d from O.004M to 0.05M of indium ions and e water. During electrodeposition procedure, the plating bath is normally maintained at a temperature of from 100C to 800C. In the preferred embodiments of the invention, the electrodeposition temperature is from 200C to 650C, and in the particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, the electrodeposition temperature is from 350C to 650C. Amongst the particularly preferred embodiments of the invention, most preferred are those embodiments in which the electrodeposition temperature is from 350C to 550C. In the preferred electrodeposition procedures current densities can vary widely depending to a large extent on whether barrel or rack plating techniques are employed. However, in most embodiments of the invention where rack plating techniques are employed the current density is usually maintained within the range of from 1 to 200 millaperes per cm2. In the preferred embodiments of the invention where rack plating techniques are employed, the current density is from 5 to 100 milliamperes per cm2, and in the particularly preferred embodiments is from 1 to 60 milliamperes per cm2.Amongst these particularly preferred embodiments where rack plating techniques are employed, most preferred are those embodiments in which the current density varies from 1 to 40 milliamperes per cm2. When barrel plating techniques are employed, the applied current density is preferably from 2 to 10 milliamperes per cm2 and are most preferably from 3 to 5 milliamperes per cm2. The electrodeposition process is carried out for a period of time sufficient to electrodeposit the desired amount of the nickel indium alloy. As will be apparent to one of skill in the relevant art, electrodeposition times may vary widely depending on a number of factors including but not limited to desired thickness of the electrodeposit, current density, bath temperature and the like. Typically plating times will vary from a few minutes to several hours. The nickel indium alloy is particularly useful as a partial or complete replacement for gold in the construction of covers for hermetically sealed containers for electronic devices. This is primarily due to its resistance to corrosion and heat, and its solderability. A series of test were conducted to demonstrate the benefit characteristics of the nickel indium.alloy which indicate its availability as a total or partial replacement for gold in the manufacture of covers for hermetically sealed containers for electrical devices. Standardized commercially available nickel sulfamate Ni SO3NH2 2 solution 2.55 M of nickel sulfamate is partially diluted with deionized water or distill water so that the remainder of the bath components can be readily dissolved. Nickel chloride is added along with diammonium citrate. The pH is then adjusted to slightly greater that the desired pH of the working bath by addition of sulfamic acid, a mixture of nickel carbonate and ammonium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid.Next, indium sulfamate In SO3NH2 3 as the hydrated salt, is added, followed by addition of a trace amount of a wetting agent sodium lauryl sulfate . The bath is now brought to a volume of 1 liter by addition of distilled or deionized water and is ready to use. Using the above described procedure, a plating bath was prepared, the physical parameters of which are set forth in the following Table I. Table IComponent Amount a Nickel Sulfamate l.3M b Ammonium Citrate 0.25M c Nickel Chloride 0.075M d Indium Sulfamate 0.013M e Sodium Lauryl Sulfate ................. 0.0004M Using the plating bath of Table I, a series of experiments are conducted to evaluate the usefulness of the nickel indium alloy as a total or partial replacement for gold in the manufacture of covers for hermetically sealed containers for printed circuit boards. Chip carrier covers manufactured and sold by Semi Alloys Inc. under the trademark Combo Lid are used in the experiments. These chip carrier covers are composed of KOVAIle, a commercially available iron, nickel and cobalt alloy. Using the plating bath and process conditions of the following Table II and conventional barrel plating techniques as for example the apparatus and techniques described and claimed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,472,753 and 3,498,902, commercially available as the Sterling Portable Plating Barrel, the covers were plated with the nickel indium alloy. mhle II CUEd T Inosition No. PB ITY PLATINGTIMEBATH TEMP.

Examination of the Ni In plated samples indicated that with the exception of Run 3, there was little or no evidence of corrosion. About 30 of the samples showed some staining and peeling but the latter was probably due to the inappropriate preplating preparation. The gold plated samples appeared to have been affected more by the salt spray then the samples of RunNos. 1 to 4 without the gold plate. However the general level of corrosion or rusting was less than that obtained with testing on Standard 100 Ni 50 Au plated lids. HEAT TEST Samples from Run Nos. 1 to 4 were heated on a hot plate at 4500C for 5 minutes and examined for evidence of any blistering or peeling of the plating. The samples were free from blisters, but there was some slight additional peeling due to the general quality of the plating and not to the heat. There was some discoloration of the lids. SOLDERABILITY TEST A series of solder tests were run using the procedure of Example III taking a comboed lid, placing it over a nickel indium plated lid with a load and then running it through a nitrogen furnace to achieve bonding. The results, although not completely successful, were encouraging as the gold tin preforms did wet the nickel indium plated surfaces. The major problem was due to failure of the bond between the plate and the lid. Similar results were obtained when tests were run using two Ni In plated lids and gold tin solder. These problems were again indicative of inappropriate pretreatment of the samples. Referring again to FIG. 2, the assembling apparatus disclosed therein further comprises a plurality of pairs of spaced electrodes 17,18 and 19,20, the latter being hidden from view. The electrodes 17 to 20 are slidably supported in holders 21 to 24, inclusive, and biased downwardly by enclosing springs 25 to 28, respectively, depending from an actuating plate 29. Plate 29 is connected to an actuating cylinder 30 of any conventional type so that, when in normal position artd depressed downwardly, the electrodes 17 to 20, inclusive, resiliently engaged sealing ring 14 with substantially equal pressures. A separate pulse of current is then passed between the electrodes of each pair.Specifically, a current pulse from a source 31 is applied between electrodes 17 and 18, source 31 being excited from power supply terminals 32 through a switch 33. Similarly, a pulse of current is passed between electrodes 19 and 20 from a current pulse source 34 energized froa supply terminals 35 through a switch 36. It is also possible to perform the spot welding by using one power supply where current is passed through the pairs of electrodes as indicated above. In the operation of the apparatus of FIG. 2, after the cover 13 plated with the nickel indium alloy, and sealing ring 14 have been disposed in the cavity 15 as illustrated, member 29 is depressed by actuating cylinder 30 so that electrodes 17 to 20 resiliently engage sealing ring 14 at points 37 to 40, respectively. In this manner, current flows from one electrode of a pair through the cover and the sealing ring and out of the other electrode. Actually, the current path is divided between the sealing ring and the cover but sufficient current passes through the point where the electrode engages the sealing ring to form a spot weld between the ring and the cover, as indicated.If all of the electrodes were attached to a single power supply, the current would divide between the several electrodes in proportion to the several resistance paths, some electrodes carrying more current than others so that certain of the electrodes might not form a reliable spot weld. After sealing ring 14 has been attached to cover 13 as just described, air is applied through a conduit 41 and a passage 42 through the supporting member 16 to the under side of cover 13 to blow the cover from the cavity 15, for example into a receiving funnel of an automatic assembling apparatus. In FIG. 3 is illustrated the method of attachment of cover sealing ring unit 13 14, fabricated as described, to a container 43 having a cavity 44 in which is disposed a semiconductor device 45. As indicated, the container 43 is carried by an enlarged supporting member 46 which may be of ceramic material and carries terminal pins 47,48 sealed in the ceramic support 46 and terminating in the leads to the semiconductor device 45. Terminal pins 47 to 48 may be plated with gold or a gold based alloy, or may be plated entirely with a nickel indium alloy or may plated first with the nickel, indium alloy followed by plating with gold or gold based alloy to the minimum desired thickness. Usually the weight percent indium in the alloy is from 0.1 to 95 weight percent indium based on the total weight of the alloy. In the preferred embodiments of the invention, the weight percent indium in the alloy plated to terminal runs 47 to 48 is from 5 to 20 weight percent by total weight of the alloy, and in the particularly preferred embodiments is from 10 to 15 weight percent indium on the aforementioned basis. The manufacture of such alloy, and its use as a total or partial replacement for gold or gold based in the fabrication of the electrical contact areas of electrical devices is claimed and described in my copending U.S. PatentApplication Serial No. 605,435, entitled NovelNickel Indium Alloy For Use in The Manufacture ofElectrical Contact Areas Electrical Devices , filedApril 3O, 1984.The container 43 may be either of ceramic material or metallic if ceramic, a conductive ring 49 E sussed to the container surrounding the cavity 44. Alternatively, the improvement of this invention may be incorporated into hermetically sealed containers for semiconductors and other electronic devices of the type described and claimed in U.S. Patent No. 4,109,861. Referring now to FIG. 4 of the drawings, there is shown in exploded perspective view an hermetically sealed container for electronic devices embodying the invention. This container comprises a supporting pad 50 for an electronic device and a conductive lead frame 51 of conventional construction surrounding the pad and forming therewith a unitary construction. Layers of thermosetting plastic material 52 and 53 extend over and are fused to either side of the lead frame 51 and its conductive leads. The layers 52 and 53 are preferably of homogeneous epoxy resin in sheet, paste, or liquid form, in the latter case being partially thermoset to adhere to the frame 51.The term homogeneous is used herein and in the appended claims in its usual sense to refer to a material uniform in composition and structure thruout its mass, as a solution or a crystal CHEMICAL BR ENGINEERING DICTIONARY, Chemical Publishing Company, Inc., New York, New York to distinguish from materials consisting of a mixture of particles of two or more substances. The plastic layer 52 in sheet form has an aperture 54 dimensioned and disposed to surround the supporting pad 50 and a portion of the leads 55 of the lead frame 51.
