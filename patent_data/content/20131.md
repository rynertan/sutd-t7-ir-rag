# Switched capacitor filter.

## Abstract
The passive prefilter 61 is comprised only of a plurality of additional switched capacitors 62 which are added to a switched capacitor 63 common to a switched capacitor filter 32 . The switched capacitor 63 common to said switched capacitor filter is driven by clock pulses at the sampling frequency of the filter. The prefilter samples and holds the input signal VSin at a rate equal to an even harmonic of the sampling frequency, combines all signals held over a sampling period, and provides the filter 32 with this summed signal Vout . The prefilter reduces substantially any alias signals , that is input signals VSin of a frequency close to the sampling frequency or to an harmonic of the sampling frequency.
