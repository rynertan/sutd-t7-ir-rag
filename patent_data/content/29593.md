## Description
TITLE A Coating Composition Based On Acrylic Polymer Blends, Articles Coated Therewith, and Process For Preparing Said Coated Articles. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to coating compositions. In particular, it is directed toward lacquers whose principal film forming ingredients are two component blends of acrylic polymers, as disclosed in Zimmt United States Patent 3,823,205 issued July 9, 1974, which lacquers contain one ox more ultraviolet light stabilizers to diminish the degradation effects of the ultraviolet radiation in sunlight and one or more antioxidants selected to inhibit or retard the rate of oxidation. Sunlight is composed of electromagnetic radiation with energy in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet portions of the spectrum. When the ultraviolet portion of sunlight falls upon a clear surface coating, the energy may be partially or wholly absorbed by the coating. In many instances, the energy absorbed initiates a photochemical reaction which causes discoloration and or physical failure of the coating.Pigmented surface coatings also suffer from ultraviolet degradation. The inclusion of an ultraviolet light stabilizer can increase the useful life of both clear and pigmented coatings. Ultraviolet light stabilizers protect the coatings by absorbing the destructive, high energy ultraviolet rays and converting such energy into non destructive heat energy. Antioxidants are useful in preventing the oxidation of polymers, or for inhibiting oxidation already begun by oxygen, air, ozone or oxidizing agents of many types. The rate of thermal oxidation of the polymeric systems used in coating compositions is normally rather slow, i.e., a reaction that occurs over weeks, months, or years under ordinary conditions.However, even though the reaction may be slow, pronounced effects may be readily obervable very early in the degradative reaction. Furthermore, more rapid oxidative degradation occurs in the presence of ultraviolet radiant energy. Antioxidants can assist ultraviolet light stabilizers in effectively retarding this degradation. Acrylic lacquer finishes are widely used on the exterior of automobiles and trucks. It has been found that an excellent appearance along with depth of color and metallic glamour can be obtained by applying a clear or transparent coat over the conventional colored or pigmented coat. However, the weatherability and durability of these clear coats have been found to be poor since checking, cracking and flaking of the clear coat occurs after relatively short periods of exposure to outdoor weathering which gives the automobile or truck an unsightly appearance. Refinishing of these weathered clear coats is difficult and expensive since the clear coat must be sanded to remove cracked and flaked clear coat before a refinish coat can be applied. In an effort to retard or substantially reduce checking, cracking and flaking of the clear coat, conventional ultraviolet light stabilizers with and without antioxidants have en added to the clear coat.Also, a combination of a transDarent pigment and an ultraviolet light screener has been added to the clear coat,as suggested by LaBerge United States Patent 3,407,156 issued October 22, 1968. In each of the cases mentioned, the durability and weatherability of the clear coat was increased for a relatively short length of time but not to the extent required for a practical automotive or truck finish. There exists a felt need for acrylic lacquers effectively stabilized against ultraviolet radiation and the concomitant oxidative degradation, for use in a clear coat color coat system. Ultraviolet light stabilizers and antioxidants have traditionally been used only in those coating compositions which are utilized as topcoats. The problem with this procedure has been the tendency of the stabilizer or antioxidant to leach out of the topcoat and escape into the atmosphere, leaving the topcoat susceptible to weathering. The composition of this invention, containing ultraviolet light stabilizer and antioxidant, has a preferred utility of being used as a clear coat color coat finish and particularly as the color coat of such a finish. It is theorized that the ultraviolet light stabilizer and antioxidant will migrate from the color coat into the clear coat, thereby protecting the clear coat against weathering. The preferred finish is one in which both the clear coat and the color coat contain as additives one or more ultraviolet light stabilizers and one or more antioxidants.Some of the additives will be consumed from the clear surface through leaching, evaporation, and photochemical reaction. The high concentration of additives in the color coat will serve as a reservoir and replenish the lost additives through diffusion from the color coat to the clear coat. Acrylic lacquers prepared according to the teachings of Zimmt United States Patent 3,823,205 give finishes having excellent air dry gloss and higher water spot free temperatures and lower craze free temperatures than finishes formed from compositions whose film forming components are conventional polymer systems. These advantages make the Zimmt lacquers use ful as automotive lacquers. The novel compositions of this invention, consisting essentially of the Zimmt lacquers plus ultraviolet light stabilizers and anti oxidants, are even more useful, particularly when utilized in close coat color coat finishes as de scribed. SUMMARY OF EE INVENTION Acrylic lacquers are prepared according to the teachings of Zimmt United States Patent 3,823,205. The lacquer may be either clear or pigmented, depending upon its intended use. These lacquers contain about 1 20 by weight, based on the weight of the film forming constituents, of ultraviolet light stabilizer and about 0.1 5 by weight, based on the weight of the film forming constituents, of antioxidant. The ratio of ultra violet light stabilizer to antioxidant is about 1 1 to about 50 1. Preferred, to form a durable finish, about 5 8 by weight of stabilizer is used along with about 0.1 1 by weight of antioxi dant, and the ratio of stabilizer to antioxidant is about 10 1. DETAILED DESCRIPTION O TE INVENTION A coating composition has been developed in which ultraviolet light stabilizer and antioxidant are incorporated into an acrylic lacquer prepared by the method disclosed in Zimmt United States Patent 3,823,205. The teachings of the Zimmt patent are hereby incorporated by reference. The principal film forming ingredients in these lacquers are two component blends of acrylic polymers. One component of these blends Component A , making up at least 5 of the blends total weights, can be poly methyl methacrylate , poly ethyl methacrylate , poly propyl methacrylate , poly isopropyl methacrylate , or a copolymer of methyl methacrylate with at least one of an alkyl acrylate whose alkyl group contains 1 through 20 carbon atoms, an alkyl methacrylate whose alkyl group contains 2 through 18 carbon atoms, or styrene. Mixtures of these can be also used. The other component of the blends ComponentB , also making up at least 5 of the blends total weights, is a two monomeric component copolymer of methyl methacrylate with at least one of an alkyl acrylate whose alkyl group contains 1 through 10 carbon atoms or an alkyl methacrylate whose alkyl group contains 4 through 18 carbon atoms. Mixtures of these can also be used. The differences in glass transition temperature between Component A and Component B is at least 300C. One preferred acrylic lacquer is a solution in which Component A is at least one of 1 poly methyl methacrylate , 2 poly ethyl methacrylate , 3 poly propyl methacrylate , 4 poly isopropyl methacrylate , 5 a copolymer composed only of methyl methacrylate and at least one of an alkyl acrylate whose alkyl group contains 1 through 20 carbon atoms, an alkyl methacrylate whose alkyl group contains 2 through 18 carbon atoms, or styrene, or 6 mixtures of these andComponent B is at least one of 1 E copolymer composed only of methyl methacrylate and an alkyl acrylate whose alkyl group contains 1 through 10 carbon atoms or an alkyl methacrylate whose alkyl group contains 4 through 18 carbon atoms, or 2 mixtures of said copolymers and the solution contains an inert organic solvent for the above polymers. In another acrylic lacquer, particularly preferred, Component A of the blend is poly methyl methacrylate and Component B is at least one of 1 a methyl methacrylate methyl acrylate copolymer whose monomer unit weight ratio is 70 30 to 40 60 respectively, 2 a methyl methacrylate ethyl acrylate copolymer whose monomer unit weight ratio is 80 20 to 40 60 respectively, 3 a methyl methacrylate butyl acrylate copolymer whose monomer unit weight ratio is 85 15 to 65 35 respectively, 4 a methyl methacrylate 2 ethylhexyl acrylate co polymer whose monomer unit weight ratio is 90 10 to 70 30 respectively, 5 a methyl methacrylate octyl methacrylate copolymer whose monomer unit weight ratio is 85 15 to 65 35 respectively or 6 a methyl methacrylate lauryl methacrylate copoly mer whose monomer unit weight ratio is 90 10 to 75 25 respectively. The lacquers are prepared by first selectingComponent A and Component B and their concentrations according to the properties desired of the finish and then thoroughly mixing solutions or dispersions of these components in organic liquids, together with such other adjuncts as appear desirable. Illustrative of organic liquids which can be used are toluene, ketones such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone, alcohols such as ethanol and 2 propanol, or mixtures of these. Before use, the compositions are thinned to application viscosity with customary lacquer solvents. These compositions will ordinarily have solids contents of from about 20 to 40 , by weight, of the total composition. Well known standard solution polymerization techniques and conventional catalysts are used in the preparation of Components A and B. It is generally desirable to add plasticizer to the compositions. Plasticizers compatible with poly methyl methacrylate , such as dibutyl phthalate, bis methylcyclohexyl phthalate, butyl benzyl phthalate, tributyl citrate, polyester plasticizers and alkyd resins,are satisfactory. Whichever plasticizer is used, it is ordinarily present at a concentration of from about 2 through about 25 , by weight, of the solids of the composition. The acrylic lacquer can contain an alkyd resin and a cellulose acetate butyrate resin. If it is to be employed as a color coat, the lacquer contains pigment in a pigment to binder weight ratio of about 1 100 to about 150 100. Any of the conventional pigments used in coating compositions, including metallic flake pigments, can be used. If the lacquer is to be employed as a clear coat, it may contain transparent pigments, i.e., pigments having the same or similar refractive index as the binder of the clear coat which are of a small particle size of about 0.015 50 microns.Typical pigments that can be used in a pigment to binder weight ratio of about 1 100 to 10 100 include inorganic siliceous pigments such as silica pigments.These pigments have a refractive index of about 1.41.6.
