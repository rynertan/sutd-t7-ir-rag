## Description
The present invention relates to a novel siliconcontaining aluminum complex and to method for the preparation thereof. Ilore particularly the complex of this invention contains minor amounts of halogen, activated silicon, oxygen and hydrogen in certain relationship, whereby said complex has the capability when added to a hydrogen and oxygen containing fluid to release oxygen and hydrogen there form and to so energize such fluid that oxygen and hydrogen will continue to be released therefrom. This invention also relates to the intermediate slurry formed during the process of making the complex. The usefulness of the complex of this invention Will extend virtually to any application where such energizing ability would be advantageous. For example, the complex of this invention will effect the pressurization of a confined container including any one of a myriad of active ingredients or adjuvants, e.g., non food foam products such as shave creams, shampoos, oven cleaners foods such as whipped toppings and cheese spreads low viscosity personal and household product such as hairsprays, deodorants, insecticides, colognes, antisz tics and medicants high viscosity products such as saints, varnistles and acrylic coatings which ingredients or adjusT2nvs can this be an from sake container in the form desired, e.q., as a gas yde, solid or foam. In effect, therefore, the comple. as the invention providens a dramatic replacement for the gas initiated aerosol propellants, particularly the fluorocarbons but also hydrocarbon and compressed gas systems.Moreover, unlike the fluorocarbons, the subject complex is non polluting and safe environmentally havig no adverse impact of any kind on ozone. Coupled with its non activeness ale non flamability, and the minor amounts needed or such energizing, the potential implications of the ssubject complex are enormous. In addition to its usefulness in making the complex, the intermediate slurry is also useful in the preparation of other products. According to this invention, the activated aluminum complex consists essentially of aluminum and minor amounts of alorine,. activated hexagonally structured silicon, oxygen and hydrogen the oxygen and hydrogen being present in atomic proportions on usually 16 18 or occasionally 14 16, 18 20 or mixtures thereof and the such of said chlorine, silicon, hydrogen ad oxygen atoms not exceeding more than about 5 percent by eight of the aluminum atoms of said complex. The complex can be prepared by the following sequence steps stus ny iluminum metal having a purity oder oder of at least about 99.97 by weight, but including at least trace amounts of silicon, with a source of acid of a type and concentration which will remove and inhibit the formation of oide thereon simultaneously o thereafter contacting said aluminum metal with mercury or less preferably a source of mercury an oxygen containing atmosphere 2 at least partly immersing said mercury contacted aluminium in an acidic solution containing halogen to effect a slurry of particles of said mercurycontacted aluminium in said halogen acidic solution, at a temperature of between ambient and not more than about 30 C 3 increasing the pll of said slurry to the pH wherein such halogen as is no contained in the slurry material remains active, i.e., not chemically bound, but is not liberated as halogen gas 4 contacting the surface of an aluminum material containing amounts of from trace to about 2 silicon atoms by weight, with the material of 3 above 5 heating said contacted surface to a temperature not higher than that at which the halogen would be liberated as a gas and under conditions of low humidity to insure that a hydrogen halide is not formed for a period at least sufficient to observe a powder growing from the contacted surface of the silicon atom containing aluminium 6 removing said powder as desired and contacting such uncer substantially inert conditions with a flow of hydrogen gas, whereby the desired activated aluminium, chlorine, silicon, hydrogen and oxygen complex Is formed. For a better understanding of the invention, reference will now be rade to the accompanying drawings, wherein IS is a schematic sectional elevational view of one embodiment of stage 1 of the process of the present invention. FIG 2 is a schematic view similar to FIG 1 showing in the optional embodiment of stage one of the process of the present invention. FIG 3 is a schematic view similar to FIG 1 showing the formation of the slurry in the HCl bath in stage two of the process of the present invention. In this embodiment the aluminium is disposed substantially equidistant from the sides and action of the vessel. i depicti on 3 ne structure of the untreated, inactive silicon found in the aluminium foil used in stage four of the process of the present invention. FIG 5 is a depiction of the hexagonal structure of 5the silicon of the complex formed in stages five and six of the process of the present invention, or in the slurry inter et nte. The activate silicon containing aluminium complex of the invention can be conveniently prepared utilizing a six process trong the process is not to be arrowly construed as being limited as .The first stage, the preparation of a form of aluminium which can be termed phase one can typically be carried out as follows Utilizing the apparatus of FIG 1, an aluminum bar or rod 1 is placed, as shown, in a vessel 2, the latter preferably of glass, and a thin Layer of hydrochloric acid 3 is placed thereover slightly covering the aluminium In this context, the shape of the aluminium is not narrowly criticalHowever, a bar or rod shape is generally preferred.The purpose of the acid treaiiaen .s to inhibit the formation of oxide on the aluminum surface. 1 is usually the acid employed for this purpose. It is further important that the aluminium be substantially pure, on the order of but not limited to about 99.9 pure and also obtain amounts 0 silicon on the order of trade to about 150 to about 300 ppm As a practical matter, whether the aluminum is sufficiently pure can be empirically determined since, if there is an abrupt rise in temperature, this indicates oxide formation and that the aluminium starting material was not sufficiently pure. Therefore for the purposes of this application, the term substantially pure aluminium denotes that degree of purity which is emp ally determinable to be capable of being used in the process of this invention. The aluminium is then contacted or coated with mercury, preferably by placing such as the same in a similar type apparents in the presence of teh oxygen gas containing atmosphere, such as aluminium preliminary steps the temperature at the such as Ambient temperature teh acid and mercury contact can be made teneously as shown in FIG 2 In this figure the aluminium emersed in The acid bath 3 and the heavIer mercury bath the HCl forming a layer on the bath of mercury. Whether the apparatus or FIG 1 or 2 or other suitable apparatus is used, the length of time or contact with the mercury can be minimal, on the order of between about fifteen nd thity seconds longer contact, however, is not determinal.Within the context of this invention, the mercury acts only as a catalyst which effects a change in the aluminum structure.As indicated above this changed structure is phase one. The formation of phase two is the second stage in e process of this invention. This stage involves the formation of an intermediate slurry comprising phase one immersed in an acidic solution containing halogen. Particularly preferred among the suitable halogen acid solutions is hydrochloric acid. The slurry can be formed in a number of ways and the etched thereof is not critical in and of itself. For example, after contact with the mercury bath, the thus treated aluminum rod or bar is then irtirnersed in another vessel, containing a bath of SC1. The latter should usually have a normality of about 1 normal to about 2 normal, but the actual range of concentration is empirical. When phase one, which is soluble 111 HCl to some extent, is immersed in the acid solution, a rather viscous slurry, white in color, is formed. The slurry begins as a cloudy suspension and becoines increasingly denser.This is the consequence of pdrticulate growth in and on the mercury treated and activated aluminium bar or rod of phase wherein the thick chlorure 5 is denoted as forming in the acid bath. As more and nor particles form, the slurry becomes more and more viscous.Depending on the size of the aluminum bar or the amount of iFCl present, the formation of the slurry can continue up to the entire consumation of the phase one aluminum material. However, as a practical matter, the reaction will usually stop before the aluminum bar is consumed completely because the slurs will become too dense for further growth to occur. At ant point the thick slurry thus formed can be removed, partly or completely additional EICl is then added and slurry formation continued. As a practical matter, the viscosity of the slurry can be as low as 10,000 cps.For most efficient use such viscosity should be between about 12,000 and 16,000 cps This slurry is phase two. In the formation thereof pursuant to the preparation of the complex, the temperature s important, that is, between ambient and not more than about 300C, preferably between about 220C and 25 C. It should noted that a sudden adverse rise in temperature of the reaction environment at this point could again mean that the aluminium starting material was not sufficiently pure. Alternatively, though less desireably, the slu can also be made in situ in the embodiment represented by FIG 2. As shown in FIG 2, the aluminum bar or rod Is converedHCl but is also partly submerged in the source of mercyOptionally, the EiCl need not continue to cover the alumi after oxide formation thereon is prevented or inhibited.portion of the aluminum can be exposed above the surface either case, whether the HCl continues to cover the slu the aluminium or not, a growth of some kind of complex scearsThis growth, itself, in this embodiment,is not the phase two slurry of this invention The latter occurs in this in situ treatment, either when the particles of the growth fall off into the acidic portion of the HCl Hg bath, or optionally after removing the complex growth whether in the aluminum surface exposed to air, or in that covered by acid and immersing the same in a separate HCl bath to form the slurry as hereinbefore described.In either case the sequence has been followed of treating an oxide free aluminum with with mercury to change the structure of the aluminum and to effect its activation, and then contacting or continuing to contact said aluminum with SC1 to cause the phase two slurry formation. In the slurry forming step, it has been found useful, in order to avoid undesireable heat from occurring, to position the aluminum bar or rod substantially equidistant from the sides and bottom of the vessel, or at a distance from the sides and bottom of the vessel which is essentially the same as or greater than the diameter of the bar or rod, a cylindrical rod shape being preferred. It is of course possible to inhibit formation of undersirable heat without the above indicated special relationships however, in this event the avoidance of oxides as a consequence of overheating would have to be constantly monitored. In this regard, fox example, the treated bar could be constantly removed, rewashed, reinserted and recoated with mercury. The phase two slurry is quite acidic with a pM level f between about 3 and about i. It also contains both hydrogen, cxvaen and chlorine atom.s, probably in ionic form therein.for this is that the phase one material has clathrate yes, the, It can entrap or confine the hydrogen, the particle of the slurry While the aforesaid temperature gradiente are important when forming the slurry preparation to the subsequent formation of the complex, it should be noted that tlie slurry itself can also be formed using somewhat higher iermperatures, on the order of up to about 40 C, and also starting with aluminum of slightly less purity. The next stage in the process of forming the final complex, i.e., stage three, is to adjust the pH so that the chlorine defined within the said particles of the slurry becomes active active ere meaning potentially unstable but not to the extent that the chlorine is liberated as chlorine gas. In this regard, it is desirable that the pE level of the slurry ultimately reside at a pH of about 5.4 0.1 At this juncture, it could be noted that if the viscosity of the slurry is between about 12,000 and 16,000 cps, the slurry will contain between about 1.5 and about 3.0 aluminum suspended therein in elemental form. The increase in pM is accomplished by treating the phase two material with a strong hydroxide such as NaOH orKOH. The normality of the later is not critical but usually can be between about 2 and 3 normal concentration. The increased pM slurry can be termed phase three One can now go on to critical stage four. Cn a surface of a silicon containing aluminum material such as for example an aiuminWra normally used in the household the phase three material is applied, preferably spread as a thin layer over the breadest area possible of the aluminium foil. It must be emph red that while the aluminium material employed in this stage be selected from a wide range of available typesm it must also at least contain some when, from brom to about the necesary more by weight of the aluminium foil. The silicon atoms can normally be availabkle as atomic silicon, or as the silicon in silica. It has been found that if the silicon is present in amounts greatZr than two percent, the rate of reaction slows, becomes irregular and harder to control. By the term aluminium foil is mean an originally anodized aluminium preferably containing not more than 3 or 4 percent of other materials, which is then deoxidized into the well known alaminated form known as foil. With the application of phase three material to the foil, and the provision, simultaneously or shortly thereafter, o heat under conditions of low humidity, both the chlorine and the silicon atoms become highly activated.It has been that the silicon atoms of the foil take on a structural hexagonal appearance. In FIG 4 and FIG 5 the transition from the normal spherical form of silicon in FIG 4 to the hexagonal form 7 of silicon, critical to this invention, in FIG 5 is depicted. The bottom position 8 of the silicon cells remains inexplicably somewhat rounded. This structural configuration is the consequence, apparently, of the energizing action of the entrapped chlorine atoms thereon. An internal endothermic reaction apparently occurs and the indicated structure results. As stat d previously, this change in structure also occurs in the aluminum particles of the slurry. It should be noted cain that the phase three material should preferably be spread widely in a thin layer on the aluminium foil to facilitate penetration of the silicon containing aluminium foil. The heat applied must bL such o activate the chlorine atoms but again not so high that chlorine gas will be liberated. The that a temperature of between about 10 0.5 C is most prefered.The humidity of the heating atmosphere should be below about 20 . A gray powder will begin to grow from the aluminium surface, usually after about 40 hours. The time of heating is not critical but again is empirical. Usually the pulverizing procedure Will stop after about three or four days. Any suitable heating medium can D used, such as a simple oven with temperature humidity controls. The powder so obtained can be termed phase four. As stated above, it is believed that the growth of the same is the consequence of the action of he entrapped chlorine in the phase three material on the silicon of the aluminium being contacted. he active chlorine apparently attacks the aluminum containing silicon, and uses the internal heat generated by the silicon under attack to create the growth of the phase for powder on the aluminum surface. The silicon atoms transformed into the hexagonal shape as shown in FIG 5 remain in the new complex along with chlorine.At this stage, the exygen hydrogen ratio is 16 16, nor occasionally 14 14 or 18 18, the latter being more desireable since there can be a mixture of three ratio values, the resulting ratio Indication could also register as 15 15 or 1 17 or even 19 19. However, this phase four material as stils not the presurizing complex of this invention. One of the stage the phase four powder is then subjected to a under substantially tube. This acts and activated qpowder, and to saturat particularly when catalysed by a small amount of aluminium, as will be described in preater detail later. The resulting activated phase five powder is the desired final product of this invention. The complex thus formed has the appearence of an intensely dark gray powder it contains minor amounts of ne, silicon in activated hexagonal form and hydrogen and oxygen. The total amounts of the four minor constituents should not amount to more than 5 percent by weight of the aluminium.The amount of silicon will vary from trace to about 2 weight percent the chlorine will be present at least n those arounts which are sufficient to active, i.e., to heat up the silicon i.e. in order to change the shape of the silicon to substantially hexagonal orm. In the phase five complex, the ratio of oxygen to hydrogent will now be 16 18 and or, much less often, 14 16 or 18 20 or mixtures of the same with a resulting indication of 15 17 or 17 19 . This complex is Intensely dark gray in color and has been found to have specific gravity of about 2.2.It will start neic ing at about 430 C and be completely consumed at about 600 C. The additional two hydrogen atoms obtained over the phase four material is the consequence of the hydrogen enriching step. As a consequence the ratio of oxygen to hydrogen changes as indicated could also be represented as follows 16 oxygen 16 hydrogen 2 Hydrogen or 16 Oxygen was then re immersed in a bath of 2NaHCl. At this point the rod was positioned equidistant from the sides and bottom of the vessel. A growth was observed on the immersed surface of alurninum, on all sides thereof. The aluminum bar also begins to dissolve in the HCl bath. Almost immediately a milky white cloud began to appear. After about 8 hours a slurry began to be discernable.The temperature was kept below 30 C. The reaction continuned until all of the aluminum bar was consumed. Before the bar was consumed, however, the slurry became so thick the reaction was severely inhibited. This occurred after about 48 hours. The thick slurry was then removed and. fresh HC1 added. This was continued until the dissolution of the aluminum was completed slurry had a pH of 3.5 The pH of the slurry was then adjusted to 5.4 by reducing ttie hydrogen ion content by addition of NaOH. EXAMPLE 2 Formation of Complex Th e slurry of Example 2 then as spread on a thin film over a surface of an ALCOA made commercially available aluminum foil containing about 1.2 silicon. The foil, with slurry thereon, was heated at a temperature of about 40 C while under substantially anhydrous collditions, i.e., a humidity of about 18.5 . After about two hours a slight growth of morphous gray powder was observed growing from the foil.This continued for about of hours when growth ceased. At this was the temperature was reduced to amblent. After about 72 hours it was observed that the pulverizing process ceased. The two additional hydrogen atoms are evidently eIlt.ral ped in the clathratc structure of phase four. The phase five material of this invention will remain as is , i.e., stable, in its superhydrogentated activatable condition for a period of between 10 and 14 days at ambient temperatures.After that period the excess hydrogen will gradually be released i.e., lost . At this point the material is again phase four further hydrogenation, to return to the active state, is then necessary. The activated complex, even in tiny amounts, as hereinafter described, will also have the unique ability to release oxygen and hydrogen from a hydrogen and oxygen fluid, particularly when a catalytic amount of aluminum metal is additionailv present This invention can be further illustrated by the following examples. Unless otherwise indicated all percentages are by weight EXAMPLE 1 Formation of Slurry Intermediate 500 grams of aluminum rod, having not more than 0.1 impurities was placed in a 36 inch long shallow glass vessel as exemplified by FIG 1.At a temperature of 200C, the aluminum was contacted with 3N hydrochloric acid in amounts sufficient to cover the aluminiiin rod. Thereafter the aluminum rod was removed from the first HC1 bath and immersed in a mercury bath for approximately 20 seconds under moist about 30 humidity air atmospheric conditions. There also being a layer of HCl covering the mercury ball. The mercury contacted aluminum rod Powder was removed from the foil when growth ceased i.e., after about 40 hours .At this point the powder was ascertained to have 16 atoms of hydrogen per molecule of complex and 16 atoms of oxygen as measured by gas chromatography or infra red spectrometer. The gray powder was removed frorn the surface and was placed in a vacuum tube horizontal with low traps . A stream of hydrogen 7as slowly passed over the powder, the flow being checked with a Beckmann analyzer, until the latter showed that the powder had acquired an additional to atoms of hydrogen, i.e., it now contained 18 atoms of hydrogen. It was observed that if the vacuum tube was warmed slightly beforehand by electrical coiis that the acquisition of H2 was facilitated. The traps of the vacuum tubes were emptied and an intensely dark gray powder was removed. The specific gravity of such was 2.2. Analysis now showed an oxygen to hydrogen atomic ratio of 16 18. This relationship persisted for about two weeks. After thls time the enriched H2 was found to have been substantially released, and the oxygen hydrogen ratio was again measured at 16 16. Further spectrographic analysis of the intense dark powder revealed the silicon hexagonal structure as shown in FIG 5. As a group, propellants, especially fluorocarbons, which are used is aerosol composition as under severe attack being ascroben to h ents, as i slieged adverse consequences on the ozone level of the upper atmosphere.There is, therefore, a great need for a viable remplacement of the gaaseous, existing propellants. The complex of this invention meets this need. It is non reactive, non flammable but more importantly, in the commercial context, is non polluting and indifferent to ozone.It is soluble in almost any material within an extremely broad range of density, viscosity and temperature without affecting the chemical formulation or tonicity of the propelled material.It is totally releasable and expendable, leaving no residue in the aerosol package. Moreover, in use, the subject inventive material has controllable parameters within accepted temperature product requirements, as well as industry and government regulations.The pressure required will be maintained constant when the materials treated by the complex are confined in a container or closed system. In this regard, vapor pressure is a function of temperature the amount of complex needed can be easily varied according to the vapor pressure needed using pure materials as a reference for an aerosol under specified temperatures from 40 F to 140 F. An ancillary benefit of the complex is that it is compatible with alr.ost any packagable materials, which could not be used 110 an aerosol type manner.plead space volume requirements ale reduce allowing for major percent increases in product content. Furthermore, the complex does not effect storage stability of the product mixture, active ingredients and or solvent solutions. It is thus apparent ihcit the Inventive complex is a replacement for aerosol propellants. Yet it is not in fact a propellant per se. Rather it is an energizer, or perhaps more accurately a pressurizing catalyst, which will enable an adjuvant or active ingredient, to be expelled from a container, just as if a fluorcarbon were present in the container using the adjuvant or active out that is, in the form of a foam, gas, liquid, liquid spray or even solid.Indeed, a remarkable consequence of the effect of the inventive complex on any hydrogen and oxygen containing composition, is that the latter itself is energized so that it retains an internal activating pressure, so that when pressure is released as with an ordinary aerosol cap, jet, or pump a foam, liquid, solid, gas depending on the type of active being used will be ejected from a container containing tile energized oxygenhydrogen composition, continuously until the container is emptied. however, as indicated above, the amount of complex needed to effect activation is minimal it will vary depending on two factors the amount of hydrogen and oxygen containing material being energized or activated, and the percentage of hydrogen and oxygen in that naterial. The relationship between the amount of complex necessary for activation and the substance being activated is also a unction of the vapor pressure desired or required, and temperature. As a practical matter the complex is added in precisely measured gram amounts into the system to be greated, the latter being either closed initially or later until the desired presents is attained for the desired temperature. A typical preparation of an energized batch can follow e t S omp needed for vapor pressurg and commercialy coments on a crosed container including a prescribed composition, in which some ingredient thereof, which can be water, will contain hydrogen and oxygen.The container in which the complex and chosen composition are placed could have unfilled headspace as low as 2 or 3 by volume, and of course more if required by government regulations. 2. To the batch thus prepared, add a small amount of aluminum. The latter acts as a catalyst to the energizing action of complex on the hydrogen and oxygen containing composition. The reason aluminum acts as a catalyst is not fully understood, but it is preferred that such be employed, although the energizing will take place although over a much longer period of time without the aluminium catalyst.The amount of aluminium for this purpose is easily ascertainable as a function of catalytic action. A suitable amount of aluminum can be as little as 1 gram for cvery 4 or 5 grams of complex. 3. The mixing of complex with the composition to be activated is carried out in a closed system. 4. Temperature and vapor pressure requirements are monitored and factored into the energizing action. 5. From the master batch, individual containers, such as the usual retail aerosol type, can now be filled, preferably but not necessarily, previously vacuumed. 6. These containers are now conditioned or energized when pressure is released, the active ingredient will be expelled from the can in the desired form, e.g., foam, liquid spray, and the like. The active ingredients can be expelled completely from the can some residual pressure will remain irl the cati no matter ho much is expelled, until the can is emtied. That is to say, as long as some energized material is in tile can, sucil can be expelled with little change in pressurized action. A possible explanation follows After the addition of aluminum to the complex containing batch, the reaction , i.e., pressurization, starts almost immediately. It is believed that after about two or three minutes the additional two hydrogen atoms are expelled from the complex.These atoms probably in the form of gaseousH2 molecules create kinetic energy in the batch and attack or agitate the already activated silicon, and also the aluminum catalyst. In turn it is believed that the excited silicon then energizes the hydrogen and oxygen ions of the hydrogen and oxygen containing fluid and pressure builds up filling the headspace. When such is placed in individual aerosol containers, the sante action is reproduced on a mini scale, i.e., the headspace of each container is pressurized. When the pressure of the batch, or the mini containers is relieved by valve or putup actuation, the active of the batch or container is expelled therefrom in the form, e.g., gas, foan, spray, etc., desired.It is to be emphasized that after each actuation the contents of the container or bath remains pressuried. The headspace, under confinement, again is pressurized and the container is ready again in a matter of seconds to be actuated, i.e., the ingredients can again be expelled under pressures This can continue until all of the contents of the container are evacuated, i.e., with no residue remaining. An interesting corollary to the phenomena inherent in this inveiitlon, is that the master batch need not be energized in the exact proportions required ab intis. To illustrate, if te grams of complex are required to energize 100 gallons of active containing composition, at a required pressure of for example 40 psi., the sane 10 grams cdn be placed in a .rnaller quantity, e.g., 10 gallons of active. The latter quantity builds to a pressure of 400 psi., which can then be used by merely mixing with the additional 90 gallons at a later time, to complete the energization to a pressure of 40 psi. The following example is illustrative of the prepara tion of material for use in aerosol type containers EXAMPLE 3 In a 1,000 gallon steel pressurizinq mixing tank was added 960 gallons of a glass cleaning composition having the following formulation 90.56 water 9.00 butyl cellulose .30 ammonia .04 perfume .10 foaming agent NINOL TM ohm Haas To the formulation there was then added 2 grams of aluminium metal in the form of a powder in an aluminum bag. at vat contained an unfilled headspace of approximately 2 1 2 . To the vat there was then added 4 grams of the complex material of Example 1, said amount being sufficient to effect a vapor pressure of 40 psi at 70 F. The tank was sealed tightly. After about 50 minutes the contents of the tank were fed to a filling line, where individual valve actuatable aerosol type containers, of different standard sizes, were then filled and sealed. After filing, it was observed that when he valves the cans were actuated a spray containing the glass cleaning composition was expelled there form. Such evacuation of contents under pressure continued until the container was completely empty. The vapor pressure remained constant at each activation In like manner, as with Example 3, pressurized containers for oxygen and hydrogen fluid containing shaving cream, shampoo, oven cleaner, whipped topping, hairspray, deodorant, insecticide, antiseptic and other comparable formulations are prepared, and the results noted in Example 3 are obtained. While the phenomena observed with this invention is not fully understood, it is thought that it may be somewhat explainable on the basis that the subgrain structure of aluminum appears to undergo profound changes when under chemical and electrochemical attack. Although the full significance of these changes and the full extent to which such changes control the characteristics of aluminium and alloys thereof is not yet telly established, it is believed that these changes in the subgrain structure funish an explanation for some of the puzzling peculiairities of behavior which have been enoutered. A key skip is the process of this invention would appear to be the sortation of the slurry intermediate. In this regard it should be noted that when ordinary aluminium is introduced into an HCl solution, e.g., IN or 2N, the production of aluminium chloride and water occurs.However, the mercury treated aluminium employed in this invention is quite a different creature. There is still the formation of Al Cl3, and other aluminium compounds, e.g. aluminium oxide, possibly aluminium hydroxide and aluminium CH2 or hyrate as well, when such is immersed in the HCl solution. However, after the passage of from about 8 to about 72 hours a slurry is formed starting as a faint white cloud. This is a consequence of a growth on tulle treated aluminum which growth then bath and begins to form the slurry.After a passage of about 8 hours or so, the slurry is in full bloom and a discernible iiicrease in viscosity bins to occur, leading to a preferred viscosity range of 12,000 to 16,000 cups. In this slurry, a relatively small amount, weightwise of activated aluminium growth particles is suspended perhaps as a colloid. The percentage of the same is desiredly between about 1.5 and 3.0 by weight. These growth particles, however, now contain entrapped therein because of their clatherate properties, free chlorine from the HCl oxygen and hydrogen probably is molecular or ionic form. The silicon of the aluminium in the slurry has also been changed to the hexagonal structure. Thus the is e st contains The has product of aluminium and hydrochloric , and OH ions. b Free activated aluminium suspended, probably colloidally, containing hexagonally structured silicon and also additionally containing traces of chlorine, hydrogen and oxygen entrapped therein. The unusual properties of the slurry may possibly also be explainable as a consecluent of Van der Waal s forces or th well known ability of particles In colloidal suspension to attract and retain on their surface dissolved substances and solvent molecules, i.e., to have molecules present in the solution even in ionic fonn become entrapped in or adhered on the particulate matter of the slurry or colloid. Whatever is the explanation, the slurry is a critical intermediate. The minimum requirements for the formation of the slurry intermediate would appear to be as A. As stated previously, the aluminum starting material should he pure. More particularly it should be essentially oxide free. Fo the formation of the slurry the aluminium starting material must, however, have one inpurity, and that is silicon. Moreover, the amount of silicon impurity in the starting material is important. If too little, the necessary growth in and on the aluminium will not take place or take place too slowly to be practical.If too much, the reaction becomes too active , and overheating results which then results in formation of oxides, and possibly the liberation of hydrogen and chlorine gas. It has been found that a , SO 300 ppm of silicon in the aluminium statt en is practical but the critical amount material silicon crosed formation and overheating. As a practical matter the purity of the aluminium starting material usually controls the amount of silicon wheather in elemental or as silica present.As stated previously, in the formation of the complex of this invention this purity should be of the order of at least about 99 97 . It should be noted that the purity of the aluminium starting material for the preparation of other products need not be as stringent, and alurinum having a purity description of about 99.9 can as a practical matter be used therein. Again, however, this is an impirical determination. B. In the slurry forming step for the formation of the complex, the temperature as stated previously should not exceed about 30 C. In the formation of other products, SUCil as the fuel indicated above, temperatures, i.e., in tite siurry forming bath, can be tolerated as high as about 40 C. It should thus be noted that as far as the slurry is concerned the purity of the aluminum starting material and the temperature of the forming step thereof is largely determined by the product being ultimately formed. Within the stated limits, i.e., of empirical determination, the same slurry intermediate is formed no matter to what use such intermediate is subsequently to be employed. In the formation of the complex of this invention, it has been discovered that the particles of silicon of the aluminium Foil, which in the beginning were in cylindrical form, also change into a hexagonal profile, when subjected to the attack of the entrapped, active chlorine containing slurry intermediate. The pores of the aluminium under impact of the silicon assume a stellar form. The picture of the silicon cells is, therefore, that each silicaon cell assumes a hexagonal prism shape with a spherically shaped base. Thus it is clear that 1 Under certain circumstances traces of foreign particles in aluminum may become active and change form. 2 During the process immense forces change the form of the aluminum structure itself. In the present invention, it is believed the strange activation of the silicon into the hexagonal form results in the latter impacting in and upon the aluminum with such force that stellite marks are obtained. However, the tremedous impact force and strength of the silicon bullets can really only be immagined and or theorized about To reiterate, in the formation of the complex, the silicon of the aluminum foil, even in trace amounts, becomes superactivated by the chlorine of the slurry. The observed hexagonal structure which then results apparently becomes the bullet which impacts upon the surrounding medium in this invention, first the aluminum in stage five, and then when further activated or excited by the excess hydrogen of stage six of the aforedescribed process, ole the oxygen and hydrogen ions of a surrounding hydrogen and oxygen containing fluid.The pressurization of a container confining the later results.
