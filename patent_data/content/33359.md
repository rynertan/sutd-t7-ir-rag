# A method for the alkoxylation of alkanols.

## Abstract
Strontium containing materials catalyze the alkoxylation of alcohols. Strontium produced alkoxylates have sharper alkoxylate distributions, lower free alcohols, lower pour points, and better detergency than alkoxylates obtained from alkali base catalysis.
