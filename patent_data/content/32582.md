## Description
Expanded Shaped Articles of a Heat Resistant Synthetic Resin The present invention relates to expanded shaped articles of a heat resistant synthetic resin. As expanded shaped articles of a synthetic resin, polystyrene expanded shaped articles are well known in the art . It is already known to produce polystyrene expanded shaped articles by pre expanding styrene polymer particles containing a volatile foaming agent by heating with steam to prepare pre expanded particles, then heating with steam the pre expanded particles in a closed mold permitting the escape of gases, or otherwise by extrusion foaming styrene polymer particles or expandable styrene polymer particles. The expanded shaped articles, nonetheless, have the draw back that they cannot be used as thermal insulators for piping and the like associated with a relatively high temperature since they are made from styrene,and are further not suitable for applications requiring heat resistant properties. It is an object of the present invention to provide expanded shaped particles of a heat resistant synthetic resin which are widely used in various applications nacessitating heat resistant properties. Another object of the present invention is to provide expandable polymer particles containing 3 to 15 by weight the same applies hereinafter of a volatile foaming agent, a monomeric composition comprising 20 to 100t tertiary butyl styrene and 80 to 0 other polymerizable monomers. These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent from the description hereinafter. In view of the foregoing drawbacks, the present inventors have made an extensive series of studies on the improvement of heat resistant properties of the expanded shaped articles and have found out that the above objects are achieved by heating to pre expand expandable polymer particles containing a volatile foaming agent, whose monomeric composition comprises 20 to 100 tertiary butyl styrene and 80 to 0 other polymerizable monomers, thereafter heating the resulting pre expanded polymer particles by a heating with medium such as super heated steam in a closed mold provide perforations permitting.the escape of gases, or by extrusion foaming a polymer comprising a monomeric mixture of 20 to 100 tertiary butyl styrene and 80 to 0 other polymerizable monomers. The monomeric composition forming a synthetic polymer used in the present invention comprises 20 to 100 tertiary butyl styrene and 80 to 0 other polymerizable monomers, more preferably 25 to 75 tertiary butyl styrene and 75 to 25 other polymerizable monomers. In cases where tertiary butyl styrene is less than 20 , the improvement in heat resistant properties sufficient for practical usefulness is not attained. In cases where tertiary butyl styrene is more than 75 , heat resistant properties are quite satisfactory but the expanded shaped articles become rather fragile. It is therefore preferred to employed 75 or less of tertiary butyl styrene when strength is p ticularly required. Other polymerizable monomers used in the present invention include vinyl monomers such as styrene, acrylonitrile, alpha methyl styrene, methyl methacrylate, n butyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, 2 ethylhexyl acrylate and the like. Polymer particles comprising these monomers are produced by suspension polymerization or emulsion polymerization.These monomers may be added at one time when materials are charged into a polymerization vessel, or tertiary butyl styrene may first be polymerized as an initial monomer, then other polymerizable monomers may be added intermittently or at one time at a conversion rate of the initial monomer between 15 to 75 to thereby complete the polymerization.Moreover, as an initial monomer other polymerizable monomers may first be employed and polymerized, tertiary butyl styrene may then be added intermittently or at one time and the polymerization is thereby completed. In effecting pre expansion or heating molding by the use of a heating medium,.it is necessary that the polymer particles contain a volatile foaming agent. The incorporation of the volatile foaming agent may be carried out during the course of suspension polymerization or after the termination of suspension polymerization. Further, the foaming agent may be applied to polymer pellets which are obtained by pelletizing a polymer prepared by emulsion polymerization. As a volatile foaming agent used preferably in the present invention there are included n butane, iso butane, n pentane, iso pentane, petroleum ether and dichlorodifluoromethane and these are used singly or in combinations of two or more. An additive may further be added for enhancing foaming performance. As preferred additives, there are included heptane, hexane, cyclohexane, dioctyladipate, dioctylphthalate, and dibutylphthalate. As a polymer used for the preparation of the expanded shaped articles, prepared by extrusion foaming in which a foaming agent is applied by pressure in an extruder, polymer particles previously containing a volatile foaming agent as described above may be employed advantageously and even polymer particles containing beforehand no foaming agent may be used advantageously. The pre expansion of expandable polymer particles containing a volatile foaming agent is effected under a steam pressure of 0.1 kg cm4G 1020C or more, while normal expandable polystyrene particles are pre expanded under a steam pressure of0 kg cm2G 1000C . In cases of less than 0.1 kg cm2G, no desired expansion rate . is obtained.Moreover the molding after the pre expansion is carried out using a heating medium of steam or mixture steam and air under a maximum pressure at the time of molding of the interior of the shaped articles of 1.0 kg cm2G or more.If the pressure is less than 1.0 kg cm2G, satisfactory shaped articles are not obtained.

After being stored for 24 hours, the pre expanded particles were molded using a PEARL STA 0 90 molding machine manufactured by TOYO MACHINERY AND METAL CO.,LTD. A metallic mold of the type used is illustrated in Fig. 1.The molding was carried out under the conditions that both faces heating pressure i.e. heating pressure from both parts of the mold was varied from 0.7 kg cm2 to 0.8 kg cm2, 1.0 kg cm2, 1.2 kg cm2 and 1.4 kg cm2, while the following values were kept constant metallic mold heating 7 sec, charging 10 sec, pre blowing 7 sec, both faces heating 14 sec, auxiliary heating 7.5 sec, one face heating pressure i.e. heating pressure from one of the twin parts of the mold 0.5 kg cm2, water cooling 60 sec, and air cooling 180 sec. Heating pressure means the steam pressure at the inlet pipes lead ing to mold cavity.For the purpose to heat the pre expanded particles loaded in the cavity, both twin parts of the mold are equipped with steam inlet pires and small inlet holes on the favity face. The shaped articles were subjected to a visual examination as to surface state and inner bonding. Inner bonding signifies the bonding of particles on a broken surface of the shaped articles and is represented by the ratio of the number of particles torn off within the particles per se, not on the boundary faces of the particles, per total number of expanded particles on the broken surface. In other words, when the shaped articles are broken on the boundary faces of the expanded particles, bonding ratio is zero , whereas if break takes place on theparticles per se, namely, within the particles, bonding ratio is 100 . The visual examination of surface state was made from the following aspects a whether the spaces between the expanded particles on the surface of the shaped articles were filled up or not, and b the degree of melting of polymer on the surface of the shaped article. In the foregoing, the more the spaces are filled up or the less the degree of melting on the surface of the shaped article the better. The results observed are given in Table 2.
