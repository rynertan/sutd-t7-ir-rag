# GRAPHITE OR GLASSY CARBON ELECTRODE WITH MODIFIED SURFACE

## Abstract
An electrode has a graphite or glassy carbon surface at least part of which is an edge plane graphite surface or glassy carbon surface to which Cr III complexes are attached by surface C O groups. The graphite can be polished pyrolytic graphite. The complex coverage can be 5 20 . The complex may comprise proteins, enzyme substrates, specific binding agents, intermediate metabolites or the like, e.g. the protein plastocyanin, so that direct unmediated electroche mistry is possible at the electrode.
