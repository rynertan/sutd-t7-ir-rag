# A radial piston hydraulic motor.

## Abstract
The motor, which is of a reversible type, has a rectilinear shaft 1 provided with peripherally arranged semi spherical cavities 24 , each of which engaging the ball appendage 25 of a radial cylinder 21 in whose chamber 27 a related piston 28 likewise furnished with ball appendage 29 strokes axiaily, being connected by way of the latter with the spherical socket 3 located in a traverse 31 joining two discs 32 33 whose inner cylindrical surfaces roll around a pair of stationary eccentric rings 38 engaging the shaft 1 in rotation said shaft being caused to rotate by way of a drive hub integrated with the actual shaft and incorporating arms 42 drawn into rotation by one of the two said discs 33 engaging a roller wheel 45 protruding laterally from each of the radial arms into a corresponding recess 43 in the disc itself. In the case of a motor with variable cubic capacity provision is made for a pair of arms 49 with upper extremity connected to a traverse 57 and provided with hub 50 coupling outwardly in rotation with the relative internal cylindrical surface of said disc 32 or 33 the internal surface of each said hub being prismatic and coupled with a degree of clearence to the like prismatic outer surface of a corresponding fixed bush 52 whose inner surface couple in rotation with said shaft 1 said traverse 57 being adjustable for height in in order to vary c.c. fluid distribution being by way of the motor shaft itself, irrespective of the embodiment.
