# Radiation image storage panel.

## Abstract
A radiation image storage panel comprising a support, a phosphor layer provided on the support which comprises a binder and a stimulable phosphor dispersed therein, and a protective film provided on the phosphor layer, characterized in that a mixing ratio of the binder to the stimulable phosphor in said phosphor layer so varies as to show a minimum value within a region of depth of from 1 5 to 4 5 of the thickness of the phosphor layer, the depth being expressed in terms of relative distance from the protective film side surface.
