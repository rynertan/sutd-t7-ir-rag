# Permanently connecting a set of conductive tracks on a subtrate with a co operating set on a printed circuit.

## Abstract
A flexible printed circuit is secured with adhesive to a glass or plastics substrate. Electrical connection between the tracks of the printed circuit and co operating tracks 1 on the substrate is made by way of conductive fibres 3 with which the adhesive is loaded in such a proportion that no bridging electrical contact is established between laterally adjacent tracks.
