# Windshield wiper drive apparatus for a motor vehicle.

## Abstract
A motor reversing control circuit for a motor vehicle windshield wiper has a motor driven cam 35 with a first lobe defining a park position for the wiper and a second lobe defining, in relation to the first, a wipe angle. A park switch 40 is actuated by either lobe 36, 37 to reverse the output of a flip flop 30 which controls motor direction. The motor 12 is activated in response to one or more of a a main switch 42 , b the unactuated park switch 40 and c the flip flop output signalling wiper movement toward the park position. An optional timer effective to delay the motor activation in response to the main switch 42 provides a pause in the park position.
