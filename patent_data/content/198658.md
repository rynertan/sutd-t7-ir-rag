# APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR REMOTELY CONTROLLING THE DISPLACEMENT OF A MOVABLE WEB

## Abstract
An apparatus and method for remotely controlling the dis placement of video tape on a video tape recorder. An amount, rate and direction of displacement are selected by the rotation of a knob 12 . The displacement is differentiated into a series of speed commands in a remote controller 10 . The speed commands are transmitted by an asynchronous serial link 40 52 to a video tape recorder 50 where they are used to control the movement of tape on a tape transport.
