# Tone signal generation device for an electronic musical instrument.

## Abstract
A basic tone signal generator 10 and a difference sig nal generator 11 are provided. A desired tone signal is ob tained by synthesizing a basic tone signal and a difference signal generated from these generators respectively. The basic tone signal has principal characteristics of a desired tone signal whose tone color waveshape changes subtly with time as in a tone of an acoustic musical instrument, but it is not the desired tone signal itself, including some errors, i.e., difference from the desired tone signal. The difference signal represents the difference between the desired tone signal and the basic tone signal. Since the basic tone signal is consitituted by basic tone data whose data amount can be substantially reduced as compared to an amount of data re quired for reproducing the desired tone signal itself with a high resolution and the difference signal is constituted by difference data whose data amount can be very small. Therefore, a tone synthesization by combining the basic tone signal and the difference signal contributes greately to the simplification of the circuit construction of an electronic musical instrument.
