# Optical materials from intercalation of polyvalent cations in beta double prime alumina.

## Abstract
Beta double prime alumina is provided having a sensible amount of at least one polyvalent cationic species intercalated therein. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, such beta double prime alumina is provided having trivalent and or tetravalent cationic species intercalated therein, especially species derived from the lanthanide and actinide series of ele ments. Certain of the foregoing materials exhibit phosphores cence or fluorescence, and some are believed to be capable of producing LASER emission upon suitable irradiation. Methods for modifying beta double prime aluminas com prising contacting crystals of the aluminas with polyvalent cat ion containing salts such as in the molten state or in the gase ous state are also provided. LASER and other optical devices are disclosed employing the modified beta double prime alumi nas of this invention.
