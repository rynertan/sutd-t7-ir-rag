# ELECTRIC IMAGE RECORDING CAMERA

## Abstract
An electric image recording camera includes an imaging device 2 which converts optical information received through a lens 1 into an electric signal, and a recorder 5, 6 which records the information of one frame read out from the imaging device 2 . An optical shutter 15 can arbitrarily set for a period of time for the imaging device 2 to receive the optical information. Means 19 are provided for stopping the read out operation of the imaging device 2 while the optical shutter 15 is open, whereby the exposure time can be varied at will.
