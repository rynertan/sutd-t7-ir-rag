## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the invention This invention relates to a new and efficient process for the production of a 2 azetidinone derivative which is useful as a starting compound for the synthesis of thienamycin, nocardicin and other ss lactam group antibiotics. 2 Azetidinone is a compound which is forming the main skelton of ss lactam group antibiotics, and the ss lactam group antibiotics have gained great attention in the recent years amongst many kinds of antibacterial compounds. For example, it is well knon that the 2 azetidinone skelton of the formulaEMI1.1 is existing in penicillin group antibiotics and cephalosporin group antibiotics which no occupy the premier position as the antibacterial antibiotics, as well as in carbacenem antibiotics such as thienamycin and nocardicin which are called the fourth ene.ation antibiotics. For the synthesis of the compounds contining the 2 azetidinone skeleton, namely the 2 azetidinone derivatives, there have been proposed several methods, for example, the method of producIng 2 azetidinone from S alanine by GriOnard reaction J. Am. Chem. Soc., 71, 2124 1949 Otem. Inc., 1964, 2097 , the method of producing 2 azetidinone by con denslng an N substituted ss alanine in the presence of thionyl chloride and a tertiary amino J. Org. Chem., 23, 1102 1958 , and the method of a 2 azetidinone derivative by treating a amino acid derivative with dicyclohexyl carbodiimide Tetrahedron Letters, 21, 2783 1980 J. Am.Chem. Soc., 102, 2060 1980 . However, these methods previously proposed can hardly be said to be the commercially available processes, because they suffer from some drawbacks that the feasibility of the process depends on the chemical structure of the compound used as the starting material, that expensive reagents are needed, and or that the yield of the desired product is poor. In this situation, it is highly desirable to provide new process with the preparation of ss lactam ring in any easy way startIng from a commercially inexpensive initial material and reagent, and this eventually makes It feasible to achieve the total synthesis of the 6 lactam antibiotics such as thienamycin, mocardicin and olivanic acrid which have gained the great attention in the recent years. Suc new process will obviously obtain a great value in the commerce. Thus, we have extensively carried out the research on the new processes for convertIng a amino acid compound into a ss ss lactam compound, that is, the 2 azetidinone derivatIve, and as a result we have now found that when the amino acid compound is treated with a system comprising triphenylphosphine and a heterocyclic disulfide in the presence of an alkylnitrile, and the amino acid compound employed can undergo intramolecular condensation and readily be converted into the corresponding 2 azetidinone derivative in a favorable yield. On the basis of this finding, we have completed this invention. According to this invention, therefore, there is provided a process for the production of a 2 azetidinone derivative, which comprises treating a amino acid compound with triphenylphosphine and a heterocyclic disulfide in the presence of an alkylnitrile. The amino acid compound employed as the starting compound may optionally be monosubstituted at its amino group with an inert substituent which does not participate in the reaction with the reagents used. The process of this invention can advantageously be applied to a wide variety of amino acids of which the amino group may be mono substituted, and it provides a general method of synthetizing a 2 azetidinone compound. According to a particular embodiment of this invention, there is provided a process for the production of a 2 azetidinorze derivative of the formulaEMI3.1 wherein R1 and R2 each denote a hydrogen atom, an amino group, a substituted amino grcup, an alkoxyl group or a mono valent hydrocarbon residue, unsubstituted or substituted with an inert substituent, R3 and R4 each denote a hydrogen atom or a mono valent hydrocarbon residue, unsubstituted or substituted with an inert substituent, R5 denotes a hydrogen atom or a mono valent hydrocarbon residue, unsubstituted or substituted with an inert substituent, or R4 and R5 taken together form a ring which remains as the residue of a lactam group antibiotic when the moiety of ss lactam ring is deprived from said ss lactam group antibiotic, the process comprisIng reacting a amino acid compound of the formulaEMI4.1 wherein R1, 52, R3, R4 and R5 are each as defined above, with griphenylphosphine and a beterocyclic disulfide of the formula R6 S S R6 III wherein R6 is a heterocyclic group selected from pyridyl, benzothiazolyl, dibenzimidazolyl and pyrimidyl in the presence of an alkylnitrile of the formula R7CN IV wherein R7 is an alkyl group, particularly an alkyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, in a solvent at a temperature of from ambient temperature to the boiling temperature of the reaction mixture. In the ss amino acid compound of the formula II , R1 and or R2 may denote s a substituted amino group which may, for example, be an aralkylamino group such as benzylamino, and triphenylmethylamino, or an aralkyloxy or an alkyloxy carbonylamino group such as benzyloxycarbonylamino, methoxycarbonylamino, ethoxycarbonylamino, tert butoxycarbonylamino and tert amyloxcarbonylamino, an alkanoyl amino group such as acetylamino and propionylamino, an aralkanoylamino group such as phenylacetylamino, phenoxyacetylamino, alpha hydroxyphenylacetylamino, alpha sulfophenyl acetylamino, a hetero alkanoylamino group such as 2thienylacetylamino, 1 1H tetrazolylacetylamino, 4 pyridylthio acetylamino, 2 amino 4 thiazoyl acetylamino and , cyanoacetylamlno group, and amethoxyimino 2 furylacetylamino group. Again R1 and orR2 may denote an alkoxyl group which may, for example, a lower alkoxyl group of 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as methoxyl, ethoxyl, n or iso propoxyl, n , iso , sec or tert butoxyl. The groups R1, R2, R3, R and R5 independently may represent a mono valent hydrocarbon residue which may also termed as a hydrocarbyl group which may be linear or cyclic either aromatic or aliphatic or a combination of these and which may preferably contain 10 or less carbon atoms in general. The hydrocarbon residue is desirably a saturated one. Suitable examples of the mono valent hydrocarbon residue include an alkyl group, particularly a lower alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, n or iso propyl, n , iso , sec or tertbutyl, an alkenyl group such as allyl, an alkynyl group such as ethynyl, a cycloalkyl group of 3 to 7 carbon atoms such as cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl, an aryl group such as phenyl and naphthyl, and an aralkyl group such as benzyl, phenetyl and phenylpropyl. The mono valent hydrocarbon residue Just mentioned may optionally be substituted with an inert substituent, and as this inert substituent there may be mentioned, for example, hydroxyl group, a lower alkoxycarbonyl group, alkoxyl group, alkylthio group, acyloxy group, particularly alkanoyloxy group such as acetoxy and aroyloxy group such as benzoyloxy, carbonyl group and the like. Thus, the mcno valent hydrocarbon residue, unsub stltuted or substituted with an inert substituent, which may be present for the groups R1 to R5 in the starting amino acid compound of the formula II and hence in the 2 azetidinone compound of the formula I includes, for example, 1 hydroxyethyl, 2 hydroxyethyl, hydroxymethyl, 1 hydroxy 2 methylethyl, 1 hydroxy 3 phenylpropyl, acetyl, propicnyl, 3 oxobutyl, met noxycarb9nylmethyl, methoxycarbonylethyl, ethoxycarbonylmethyl, tert butoxycarbonylmethyl, methoxyethyl, acetoxyethyl, 2 acetoxypropyl, tetrahydropyranyloxyethyl groups and the like. In some cases, the groups R4 and R5 taken together may form a ring which remains as the residue of a ss lactam group antibiotic when the ss lactam ring is deprIved from said S lactam group antibiotic. Such ring may, for example, be of the following formulae EMI7.1 By the term lower herein used is meant that the group or compound to which the term lower is attached contains up o 6 carbon atoms, preferably up to 4 carbon atoms. Typical examples of the amino acid compound of the formula II used as the starting material in the process of this invention include ss alanine, alpha methoxy ss alanine, alpha amino ss alanine, alpha 1 hydroxyethyl ss alanine, alpha ethyl ss alanine, alpha amino ss 2 hydroxyethyl ss alanine, ss 2hydroxyethyl ss alanine, ss 2 acetoxyethyl ss alanine, ss phenyl ss alanine, N benzyl ss alanine, ss aminoglutaric acid mono methyl ester, ss aminoglutaric acid mono ethyl ester and ss aminoglutaric acid mono tert butyl ester. The process of this invention may be shown by the following equation EMI8.1 In the process of this invention, the cyclization of the starting amino acid compound II is effected using triphenylphosphine and a heterocycllc disulfide as the condensation agent in the presence of an alkylnitrlle as described hereinbefore.The heterocyclic disulfides which are used in combination with triphenylphosphine as the condensation ant for the above mentioned cyclization reaction In the present process may, for example, be 2,21 dlpyrjdyl disulfide, 2,2 benzethiazolyl disulfide, 2,2 dibenzimidazolyl disulfide and 4,4 dipyricyl disulfide, 2,2 dipyrimidyl disulfide and so on. The quantities of the triphenylphophine and heterocyclIc disulfide used as the condensation agent are not critical but may vary in a wide range depending on the nature of the starting compouhd used, the reaction condItions employed and the other factors of operating the process. In general, however, both of the triphenylphosphine and heterocyclic disulfide may be at least 1.0 molar proportion and preferably 1.O to 1.3 molar proportions for 1.0 molar proportion of the starting amino acid compound used. The triphenylphosphine and heterocyclic disulfide may usually be used in equimolar proportions. In the process of this invention, the cyclization reaction using the condensation agent comprising the combination of the triphenylphosphine and heterocyclic disulflde is readily carried out in a manner known per se as described in, eg. the Tetrahedron Letters 1970, 1901. In accordance with this invention, the cyclization reaction is found to proceed very smoothly and very efficiently at a neutral pH value when It is conducted in the presence of a nitrile compound, particularly an alkyl nitrile. The alkylnitrile available for this purpose includes, for exa ..ple, acetonltrile and propionitrile. Acetonitrile is most preferred. The quantity of the alkylnitrile used is not critical and may vary over a wide range depending on the nature of the startIng amino acd compound used, the reaction conditions employed and the other factors of operating the process. It is preferable that the alkylnitrile is used in excess so that the alkyl nitrile itself can serve also as the solvent of the reaction. Of course, however, it is possible to use the other organic solvent in admixture with the alkylnitrile. The solvent available for this purpose includes, for example, a halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, esters such as dimethylsulfoxlde and ethyl acetate, aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene, water, lower alkanols such as methanol, ethanol, and cycloalkanes such as cyclohexane, and ketones such as acetone. The reaction temperature at which the above cyclization of the amino acid compound is effected according to this invention is not critical but may vary widely usually in the ran from ambient temperature to the boiling temperature of the reaction mixture. It is preferred to carry out the reaction at the refluxing temperature of the reaction mixture. The reaction may proceed under atmos pheric, subatmospherlc or superatmospheric pressure. It has been found that the reaction of cyclizing the ss amino acid compound ith formation of the ss lactam ring can be affected by the concentration of the starting amino acid compound present in the reaction system, and that the yield of the desired 2 azetidinone derivative is likely to decrease with increased concentration of the starting ss amino acid compound. Advantageously, the amino acid compound may be present In the reaction system generally at a concentration of about 0.001 M to about 1 X and preferably of about 0.01 to about 0.1 14. Accordingly, when the process of this invention is carried out, it is possible to add the starting amino acid compound or triphenylphosphine or the do sulfide dissolved in a solvent dropwise to the reaction mixture so that the concentration of the amino acid compound in the reaction system is controlled to a preferred level. To recover the desired 2 azetidinone compound of the formula I from the reaction mixture after the completion of the reaction and to purify the product, it is possible to follow a known recovery and purification technique, for example, extraction with organic solvent, chromatography and recrystallization. The process of this invention is able to afford the 2 azetidinone derivative of the formula I in a favorably high yield, and this desired product is very useful as an intermedi2te for synthesis of a variety of S lactam group antibiotics For instance, according to the process of this invention, a 4 lower alkoxycaronylmethyl 2 azetidinons of the formula I a shown below can be prepared from a ss aminoglutaric acid mono lower alkyl ester. From the 4 lower alkoxycarbonylmethyl 2 azetidinone can be synthetired thienamycin via the route as described in the J.Org. Chem., 5, 1130, 1135, 1142 1980 and as shown by the following equation EMI12.1 Thienamycin Most of the amino acid compounds of the formula II which are used as the starting compound in the process of this invention are known, but some of then are new compound.For instance, such compounds of the formula II where R1,R2, R3 and RS are all a hydrogen atom and R4 is a lower alkoxycarbonylmethyl group, that is, the compound of the formulaEMI12.2 wherein R denotes a lower alkyl group is a novel compound which has never been described in literatures.The new compound of the formula I a may be prepared by a ne process comprising reacting a a N protected or unprotected aminoglutaric acid Åai alkyl ester of the formula EMI13.1 wherein R is a lower alkyl group and A is a hydrogen atom or an amino protecting group removable by hydrogenolysis or. mild hydrolysis, with an ester hydrolyzing enzyme an esterase in an organic solvent at a pH and at a temperature at which the enzyme employed is enzymatically active, to remove hydrolytically and preferentially one ester forming alkyl group R from the compound V without cleavage of the other ester forming alkyl group, and then removing, if necessary, the residual amino protecting group A from the resultIng hydrolysis product in a known manner, as described and claimed In the applicant s co pending U.S. patent application No. see Japanese patent appli caticn Nos. 146,344 80 and 146,345 80 . In this new process, the amino group of the compound V may be protected with an amino protecting group such as benzyloxycarbonyl group. When this new process is conducted using a 5 aminoglutaric acid di lower alkyl ester of which the amino group is unprotected, there is afforded an optically active ss R aminoglutaric acid mono lower alkyl ester the half ester .While, when this new process is conducted using the S N protected aminoglutaric acid di lower alkyl ester of which the amino group has been protected e.g. with benzyloxycarbonyl group, there is afforded an optically active a S aminoglutaric acid mono lower alkyl ester the half ester . When the ss aminoglutaric acid mono alkyl ester of the above formula II a so prepared is cyclized by applying thereto the process of this invention, there is obtained a 2 azetidinone compound of the formulaEMI14.1 wherein R is as defined above, which is the novel compound, too and which, depending on the steric configuration of the compound II a employed, has the R or S configuratlon as shown below.EMI14.2 Among them, the S isomer of the formula I a l is especially useful as it can be utilized for the production of thienamycin via the synthetic route as stated here in before.
