# 1 Carbocyclic aryl 2 mono or bis alkoxycarbonyl guanidino ethanes, and methods for their preparation and the preparation therefrom of 4,5 dihydro 2 alkoxycarbonylamino 5 carbocyclic aryl imidazoles.

## Abstract
A method for preparing 4,5 dihydro 2 alkoxycarbonylamino 5 carbocyclic aryl imidazoles and substituted aryl derivatives thereof is disclosed. The compounds are prepared by treating a 1 carbocyclic aryl 2 2 ,3 bis carboalkoxy guanidino ethane of the formula
