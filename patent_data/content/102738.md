# Laminated multiple layer flexible packaging structures and packages such as pouches made therefrom.

## Abstract
Retortable packaging film is made entirely from polymeric materials and has an improved heat sealable structure incorporating an inner heat seal layer 12 of linear low density polyethylene. Next to this is a second layer 14 containing linear low density polyethylene with an optional 0 to 80 medium density polyethylene blended into it. A third layer 16 of the film is anhydride modified medium density polyethylene fourth, fifth and sixth layers 18, 20, 22 respectively are nylon, ethylene vinyl alcohol and nylon. Optionally another layer between the second and third layers 14, 16 is provided, this layer comprising the blend of at least 20 linear low density polyethylene and up to 80 medium density polyethylene. The entire multiple layer structure is firmly adhered together so that the layers mutually support each other in the unitary package. A retortable pouch can be made from two confronting pieces of film arranged with their layers 12 facing one another and fused together as shown by heat sealing along the periphery of the pouch.
