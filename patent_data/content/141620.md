## Description
This invention relates to the field of specific binding assays and reagents therefor particularly those in which some of the reagents are bound to a solid phase and used to determine ligands in liquid samples containing interfering substances. The development of specific binding assay techniques has provided extremely useful analytical methods for determining various organic substances of diagnostic, medical, environmental and industrial importance which appear in liquid media at very low concentrations. Specific binding assays are based on the specific interaction between a ligand, i.e. a bindable analyte under determination, and a binding partner therefor, i.e. receptor. Where one of the ligand and its binding partner is an antibody and the other is a corresponding hapten or antigen, the assay is known as an immunoassay. These specific binding assays have been provided in a variety of solid state formats including analytical elements or test strips, coated tubes, particle associated reagents and others. Agglutination assays are among the most widely used solid state specific binding assays, usually as immunoassays. When assaying complex liquids, such as human serum, some proteins and other substances can cause non specific interferences with the agglutination reaction. Therefore, these proteins must be destroyed or their non specific interaction with the reagents overcome to obtain accurate measurement of ligand concentrations. The most common approach to avoiding non specific protein interference has been by first digesting the proteins with a proteolytic enzyme such as pepsin. The enzyme is then inactivated or destroyed prior to the assay. For example, Collet Cassart, et al, Clin. Chem., Alternatively, these assays can be performed using particles which are not susceptible to interaction with substances that cause non specific interference. For example, Hosaka, et al, EPO Application 54,249 discloses immunoassay reagents formed of an immunochemical containing an amino group, e.g. an antibody, which is covalently bound to an epoxy group on the surface of particles comprising a polymer having the repeating unit of glycidyl acrylate and or glycidyl methacrylate. The particles are not to have other hydrophobic components on their surface. When the epoxy groups are not all consumed by binding with the above immunochemicals, hydrophilic proteins, e.g. albumin, which do not interfere with the immunoassay can be reacted with the remaining epoxy groups. It is said that these particles are unlikely to agglutinate non specifically and are free from non specific adhesion to cells. In accordance with the present invention, specific binding assays are provided in which the effects of non specific interference are avoided or overcome by a new class of solid phase, e.g. particulate, reagents. As such, these reagents make it possible to provide a homogeneous immunoassay format, i.e. one which requires no separation step, in which this interference has been overcome and which is particularly suitable for use in automated analysis systems. These advantages are achieved by a hydrophilic specific binding assay reagent which reagent is prepared by a process comprising the steps of reacting a partner of a specific binding pair and at least one hydrophilic substance, which haloalkyl moieties present on the surface of a solid phase, to bind the said partner of the specific binding pair and the said hydrophilic substance to the solid phase by replacement of the halide atom on the alpha carbon of the alkyl moiety and recovering the reagent so prepared from any unreacted binding partner. Preferably, the alpha haloalkyl is chloromethyl and the at least one hydrophilic substance comprises at least one protein, such as albumin, and at least one non proteinaceous amine to which the solid phase is impermeable, such as tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane. The specific binding assay reagent of the invention can be combined with other reagents to provide an assay composition. For example, the composition can comprise the above reagent and the other partner of said specific binding pair. The other partner of the specific binding pair is preferably a ligand carrier complex. Various embodiments, which include or use the composition are also contemplated. For example, the composition can be provided as part of a test kit comprising the packaged combination of one or more containers of or devices incorporated with the components of the composition. Sample fluids on which tests are performed include biological, physiological, industrial, environmental, and other types of liquids. Of particular interest are biological fluids such as serum, plasma, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, milk, broth and other culture media and supernatants as well as fractions of any of them. Physiological fluids of interest include infusion solutions, buffers, preservative or anti microbial solutions and the like. Industrial liquids include fermentation media and other processing liquids used, for example, in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, dairy products and malt beverages. Other sources of sample fluid which are tested by conventional methods are contemplated as within the meaning of this term as used and can, likewise, be assayed in accordance with the invention. The term ligand refers to any substance, or class of related substances, whose presence is to be qualitatively or quantitatively determined in a sample fluid, such as those just described. The present assay can be applied to the detection of ligands for which there is a specific binding partner and, conversely, to the detection of the capacity of a liquid medium to bind a ligand usually due to the presence of a binding partner for the ligand in the sample . The ligand usually is a peptide, protein, carbohydrate, glycoprotein, steroid, or other organic molecule for which a specific binding partner exists or can be provided by immunological or synthetic means. The ligand, in functional terms, is usually selected from antigens and antibodies thereto haptens and antibodies thereto and hormones, vitamins, metabolites and pharmacological agents and their receptors and binding substances. Specific examples of ligands which can be detected using the present invention are hormones such as insulin, chorionic gonadotropin, thyroxine, triiodothyronine, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, and estriol antigens and haptens such as ferritin, bradykinin, prostaglandins, and tumor specific antigens vitamins such as biotin, vitamin B₁₂, folic acid, vitamin E, vitamin A, and ascorbic acid metabolites such as 3 , 5 adenosine monophosphate and 3 , 5 guanosine monophosphate pharmacological agents or drugs such as aminoglycoside antibiotics like gentamicin, amikacin and sisomicin, or drugs of abuse such as the opium alkaloids and ergot derivatives antibodies such as microsomal antibody and antibodies to hepatitis and allergens and specific binding receptors such as thyroxine binding globulin, avidin, intrinsic factor, and transcobalamin. The terms specific binding protein or receptor refer to any substance, or class of substances, which has a specific binding affinity for the ligand to the exclusion of other substances. In the majority of embodiments, the present invention will incorporate specific binding assay reagents which interact with the sample ligand or the binding capacity of the sample for the ligand in an immunochemical manner. That is, there will be an antigen antibody or hapten antibody relationship between reagents and or the sample ligand or the binding capacity of the sample for the ligand. Such assays therefore are termed immunoassays and the special interaction between the ligand and its receptor, or binding partner, is an immunochemical binding. The use of either polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies is contemplated. Additionally, it is well understood in the art that other binding interactions between the ligand and the binding partner serve as the basis of specific binding assays, including the binding interactions between hormones, vitamins, metabolites, and pharmacological agents, and their respective receptors and binding substances. For example, polypeptide hormone receptors as binding agents or partners are discussed in Langan, et al, Eds. The solid phase of the present invention can take on a multitude Of forms, and is therefore intended as being broad in context. It can be mono or multi phasic, comprising one or more appropriate materials or media of similar or different absorptive or other physical characteristics. In one embodiment the solid phase is a matrix or surface associated in any of a variety of ways with specific binding assay reagents. It can take on many known forms such as those utilized for chemical and enzymatic solution analysis. For example, the element can be in the form of a test slide, made in part from a material such as unsubstituted polystyrene. In its most efficient embodiment the solid phase can be carefully tailored to suit the characteristics of the particular specific binding assay system to be employed. The most preferred solid phase format is particulate. As previously noted, particle associated agglutination assays include assays using particles having specific binding pair members as surface components or particles to which such components have been bound. These particles can be formed of one or more layers and can include a core particle. The material of which the core or layers, other than the surface layer, is formed is not critical. Whether of multilayer or uniform composition, they can be of insoluble polymers or copolymers prepared from such monomers as styrene, substituted styrenes, butadiene, acrylic acid, acrylic esters, acrylamide, acrylonitrile, the corresponding methacryloyl monomers including functional esters, e.g. glycidyl ester , and bifunctional monomers crosslinkers such as divinyl benzene, methylene N,N bisacrylamide and many others. These particles preferably range in size from about 0.05 to about 5.0 µm microns in diameter and form a latex, e.g. a free flowing liquid in which such microscopic particles are suspended. The solid phase, such as a particle, is selected or synthesized to have on its surface a haloalkyl moiety in which the halogen is activated by virtue of its relative position to groups to which it is attached. To those skilled in the art it is known that electron donating groups, such as aryl, carbonyl, nitrile, sulphone and sulphoxide, render halogens in the alpha position quite reactive. In context with this invention, the term haloalkyl comprises the bromide and chloride substituted lower alkyl chains, e.g. C₁ to C₄. These groups are attached to the polymer surface in such manner that the halogen is in the alpha position to an activating group, e.g. phenyl group. Particles of this sort and their preparation are described, for example, in Vituske, et al, U.S. Patent No. 3,072,558. A binding partner, such as an antibody, is bound to the solid phase by replacement of the halide group on the alpha carbon of the alkyl moiety. Since this binding partner is usually a protein, whether antibody or other protein, there are numerous amino and sulfhydryl groups which can effect this substitution thereby covalently coupling the binding partner to the solid phase. The proportions of alpha haloalkyl moieties on the solid phase and the binding partner are such that the moleties are not all coupled with binding partner. At least one hydrophilic substance is reacted with others of the alpha haloalkyl moieties, either sequentially or concurrently with the binding partner. When this hydrophilic substance is bound to the solid phase sequentially, it can be done either before or after binding of the binding partner. In either case, the hydrophilic substance binds a sufficient number of remaining moieties to create, with the binding partner, a substantially complete hydrophilic coating on the surface of the solid phase. Preferably, the hydrophilic substance includes at least one protein and at least one non proteinaceous amine to which the solid phase is substantially impermeable. Examples of preferred proteins are human and other serum albumins or gelatin. For this purpose, peptides are also contemplated when the term protein is used. Examples of non proteinaceous amines are tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, glucosamine, glycine, lysine, glutamate, The above described specific binding assay reagent can be combined with other reagents to provide an assay composition. Usually the other reagents include the other partner of the specific binding pair which is kept physically separate from the solid phase reagent of the invention until used in performing an assay. Preferably the partner of the specific binding pair which is associated with the solid phase is an antibody and the other partner of the pair is a ligand which has been bound to a carrier to form a ligand carrier complex. Exemplary of such carriers are high molecular weight polymers such as dextran or Ficoll Pharmacia Fine Chemical, Inc., New Market, NJ . Among the other reagents which can be included are proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, pepsin, carboxypeptidase and mixtures thereof. The composition can be provided in the form of a kit comprising the packaged combination of one or more containers of or devices incorporated with the components of the composition For example, the solid phase reagent of the invention can be coated on or form part of a test slide, preferably having an indented reaction well. Binding partner from a separate container of the kit, and a sample to be analyzed, are placed in the reaction well and any resultant change, such as agglutination or a color change, is visually observed. Such kits are ideal for home use and require no prior technical training. The following Example describes experiments which were performed in developing the present invention. Standard commercially available reagent grade chemicals were used whenever possible. Measurement of total serum thyroxine T₄ is the single most important test for determining thyroid function. The normal T₄ range is 4.5 to 12.0 micrograms deciliter µg dl however, the test must be able to detect concentrations as low as 1.0 µg dl and as high as 24.0 µg dl. This is necessary to accurately identify those patients who have thyroid disorders. This Example reports experiments which demonstrate a nonisotopic, homogeneous T₄ immunoassay in accordance with the invention. Antibody to T₄ was induced in New Zealand white rabbits by an intradermal primary injection of 400 µg of a conjugate which was T₄ covalently coupled to bovine serum albumin BSA emulsified in an equal volume of Freund s complete adjuvant. Secondary booster immunizations contained 400 µg. of T₄ BSA conjugate emulsified in an equal volume of incomplete Freund s adjuvant and were administered once a month. The animals were bled three times a week. The antibody so prepared was isolated by immunoadsorbtion. The immunoadsorbent consisted of T₄ covalently bound to Sepharose 4B Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Iscataway, NJ . This material was prepared using the bisoxirane method described by Sundberg and Porath in J. Chromatog., This reagent preparation makes use of a poly chloromethyl styrene latex which was prepared substantially as described in Vitkuske, et al, U.S. Patent No. 3,072,588. The antibody to T₄, human serum albumin and tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane are coupled to the poly chloromethyl styrene particles as follows. A 1 ml volume of 10 w v poly chloromethyl styrene particles in water is mixed with 1 ml of a 0.2 mg ml sodium dodecyl sulfate aqueous solution to form a latex suspension. This suspension was then centrifuged at 30,000 x g for 20 minutes, forming a pellet of the particles from the suspension. This pellet is resuspended to visual homogeneity by sonication in 2 ml of borate buffered saline pH 9.0 containing 0.01 mg ml sodium dodecyl sulfate. A 2 ml volume of this resuspension is combined with 2 ml of an aqueous solution containing 700 micrograms µg of the anti T₄ antisera and 15 mg of charcoal treated human serum albumin. The 4 ml suspension so prepared was then incubated for 4 hours at 30 T₄ was covalently coupled to cyanogen bromide activated Dextran T500 Pharmacia, supra . One hundred milligrams mg of Dextran was dissolved in 6 ml of 0.4M K₂CO₃ and the pH was adjusted to 11.0. The solution was rapidly stirred and three, fifty µl additions of cyanogen bromide solution 333 mg ml in N,N dimethyl formamide were made. The pH of the Dextran solution was maintained at 11.0 by the addition of 2N NaOH. Each addition of cyanogen bromide was made within one minute of the previous addition and after the last addition the solution was incubated for four minutes. The pH was then dropped to 10.0 with 2N HCl and 0.5 ml of a T₄ solution was added 80 mg ml in N,N dimethyl formamide made alkaline with 11 15 drops of 0.4M K₂CO₃ . The reaction mixture was stirred for two hours at room temperature then dialyzed exhaustively against 0.01M Na₂HPO₄ pH 9.0 . Typically, 60 70 moles of T₄ were incorporated into each mole of Dextran. The T₄ Dextran conjugate concentration was 10 mg ml. This was diluted in a buffer solution containing 0.05 M barbital, 0.15 M NaCl, and 0.1 azide, pH 8.6 Veronal buffer to 10 µg ml just prior to use in the assay procedure described below. A 5 ml volume of the antibody sensitized latex reagent preparation was prepared as follows. A 1.66 ml volume of the antibody sensitized latex stock solution, prepared as described above, was mixed with 533 µl of a solution containing 0.55 mg ml 8 anilino 1 naphthalenesulfonic acid ANS Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY in Veronal buffer containing T₄ free 0.1 bovine serum albumin Veronal BSA , 2.08 ml of a solution containing 20 mg ml trypsin in 1 mM aqueous HCl, 62.5 µl of Tween 20 surfactant ICI United States, Wilmington, DE that was 10 v v in Veronal BSA and 654 µl of Veronal BSA. The final concentrations were 0.11 w v of latex solids, 0.059 mg ml ANS and 8.3 mg ml trypsin. A panel of six 6 serum samples was tested for T₄ level by an assay method using particles in accordance with the invention, the same assay method using conventional latex reagent particles, carboxylated polystyrene Rhone Poulenc, Paris, France , and by a reference method. The agglutination method using the disclosed and conventional particles was also performed on a range of T₄ standard sera Kallestad Laboratories, Inc., Austin, TX . For the methods using the particles of the invention and the conventional particles, a 12.8 µl aliquot of each serum standard or serum sample was introduced into a separate tube packed in ice containing 12.8 µl T₄ Dextran conjugate, as diluted. Thereafter, 120 µl of the antibody sensitized latex reagent was introduced into each of the tubes. Each of the tubes containing the complete reaction mixture so formed was vortexed and then incubated at 37 The reference method was the Gammaflo assay E. R. Squibb Sons, Inc., Princeton, NJ method which was performed according to the manufacturers directions. The T₄ concentrations observed for these serum samples by the reference method and the methods using conventional particles and the chloromethyl substituted particles of the invention are sat forth in Table 1. As can be seen from these data, the conventional latex method was subject to interference in two of the six samples tested. The interference caused clearly erroneous reported concentrations which were well above the concentrations found by the reference and disclosed methods. The erroneous values were well above the highest commercial standard sera run 25.1 µg dl , which rendered these results useless. In contrast, the T₄ concentrations observed using particles in accordance with the invention correlated well with the values given by the reference method. This demonstrates that the non specific interference which plagued the conventional method has been avoided or overcome by this invention.
