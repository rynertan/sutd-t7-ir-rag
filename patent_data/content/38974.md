# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR COATING METAL PIPES WITH PLASTICS MATERIALS, AND COATED METAL PIPES OBTAINED THEREBY

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are disclosed for covering a metal pipe, particularly of the type utilized in modern heating systems, with a continuous covering of a pre cut web of foamed plastics material which is folded around the pipe and sealed along its contacting edges. Over said foam, an imper vious and nonpermeable film is then extruded serving the dual function of an insulating finish and casing for the insu lated pipe. The coating apparatus comprises a station 10, 11, 12 for pre heating a foamed plastics material web 5 , wrap ping the web around a metal pipe 1 and sealing or welding the web edges, a pipe cooling station equipped with sleeves 16, 17, 18 wherethrough cooling compressed air is circulated and a web covering station 31 for covering the web 5 by continuously extruding a thermoplastics material thereon in such a way as to form a strong protective film on the web coating the pipe 1 . Thus a doubly coated metal pipe is obtained having enhanced thermal characteristics, and lends itself excellently for the implementation of space heating sys tems in conformity with current regulations on the reduction of energy consumption.
