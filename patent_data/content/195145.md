DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Referring now to the Figs. 1A and 1B, a connector 5 comprises a housing 20 for detachably receiving and holding a cassette 10, the housing 20 being mounted on a printed circuit board 30. The cassette 10 is obliquely inserted in the housing 20 and is pivoted and locked in a manner to be described in detail. As used herein, the term cassette is intended to mean a package containing the storage of retrievable information and, which, in the preferred form, includes a plurality of individual electrical terminals that are exteriorly accessible and which interiorly are in electrical connection to devices containing the stored information.A connector for receipt of such a cassette 5 may be provided in a variety of devices, such as a musical instrument unit not shown that are adapted to be responsive to the data stored in such cassettes. Figure 2 is a cutaway exploded view of the housing 20 to illustrate the internal structure thereof. The housing 20 comprises, for example, a glass fiber reinforced resin or other suitable material. A cassette insertion port 21A of a hollow portion 21 has a width which is gradually increased outwardly from the bottom of portion 21. More particularly, the hollow portion 21 is formed to allow oblique insertion of the cassette 10 into the cassette insertion port 21A, as shown in phantom in Fig. lA . When the cassette 10 is pivoted to be substantially. perpen.4icuiar as shown in the solid lines in Fig. 1A to the cassette insertion port 21A, a latch holds the cassette 10, as WI I I be described. An electrical contact 22 in the housing 20 comprises a leaf spring which is securely mounted in the bottom of the hollow portion 21. When the cassette 10 is mounted in the hollow portion 21, the contact 22 is brought into contact with a selected terminal 11 Fig. 3 of the cassette, thereby making electrical connection therewith, as will be detailed. Reference numeral 25 denotes anL shaped latch plate, the material of which is preferably a spring like metal. The latch plate 25 has a slot 23 for receiving a latch pin of the cassette 10. The latch plate 25 is mounted on the side surface of the housing 20. The slot 23 has a guide function for guiding the cassette 10 into the housing 20 and a locking function for locking the latch pin. The slot 23 is generally L shaped. As illustrated in the exploded view of Fig. 3, a printed circuit board 13 is mounted to the cassette 10.Reference numerals 10A and lOB denote, respectively, a cassette cover and a screw for fastening the cassette cover 10A to the cassette housing 10. Each of the conductors 13A of the printed circuit board 13 is exposed exteriorly of the cassette so as to electrically connect to the corresponding terminal 11 Fig. 5 . Terminal 11 is supported in the cassette so as to have a portion lla disposed tor exterior access so as to allow for connection with housing contact 22 when the cassette and housing are joined. A latch pin 12 projects outwardly from an outer portion of the side surface of the cassette 10. The latch pin 12 holds the cassette in the housing 20 during insertion of the cassette into the housing 20. As shown in Fig. 4, the cassette 10 is obliquely inserted into the housing 20 so that the latch pin 12 of the cassette 10 is engaged with the slot 23 of plate 25 supported by the housing 20. In this manner, the orientatlon of the cassette 10 is not determined by the inrlin2tion of the hollow portion 21, but rather by the guide slot 23 As such, when the cassette 10 is obliquely inserted into the housing 21 along the guide 23 and is pivoted in the direction as indicated by the arrow 24, the latch pin 12 is engaged initially with the top of slot 23, and then with continued insertion with the foot portion of the slot, thereby mounting the cassette 10 securely in the housing 20. In Fig. 5 the contact 22 is shown mounted through the through aperture 31 of the printed circuit board 30 and is preferably soldered thereto. Another embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to Figs. 6 to 8. The latch means of this embodiment comprises a projection 12 formed on the side wall of the cassette 10, and a recess 23 formed in the inner wall surface of the hollow portion of the housing to engage with the projection 12 . The recess comprises a guide groove 23 A for guiding oblique insertion of the cassette into the insertion port and a locking groove 23 B for locking the projec tion when the cassette is pivoted to be perpendicular to the insertion port. Reference numeral 12 A in Fig. 6 and reference numeral 23 C in Fig. 7 denote engaging projections, respectively, each of which provide cooperative engagement between the projection and the locking groove. Figure 8 shows a state wherein the cassette 10 is mounted in the housing in accordance with this second embodiment. Figs. 9 to 11 show a third embodiment of the present invention. According to this embodiment with further reference to the second embodiment, the projection of the cassette is formed preferably in an L shape, and the housing recess is enlarged to accommodate and engage with the L shaped projection. Fig. 11 depicts a state wherein the cassette is mounted in the housing in this third embodiment. According to the third embodiment as compared with the first and second embodiments, the latching means projection of the cassette side and the latching means groove of the housing firmly mesh with each other so as to provide a polarization feature thereby preventing reverse side insertion of the cassette. As the cassette connector according to the present invention has the construction as described hereinabove, the following advantages are provided.Since the holding means mechanically holds the cassette and the housing together, the cassette need not be held by the means for electrically connecting the cassette and the housing. In addition, the cassette and the contact 22 of the housing are connected with each other through a leaf spring so as to withstand frequent connection operation of the cassette. In order to mount the cassette in the housing, the cassette is obliquely inserted and is pivoted, so that the spring con tact is brought into slidable contact with the cassette but not into point contact. In this sense, even if the cassette terminals become soiled or contaminated they can be cleaned through the sliding action, thus preventing poor connections. Having described the preferred embodiments of the invention herein, it should be appreciated that various modifications may be made without departing from the contemplated scope of the invention. For example, it should be understood that while the connector in the preferred arrangement is adapted for connection to a cassette, the electrical connector of the present invention is not so restricted and may be used to make connections with other electrical components, such as printed circuit boards or the like The true scope of the invention is set forth in the following claims.
