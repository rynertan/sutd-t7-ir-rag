# Redundant control circuit.

## Abstract
An analog output network provides redundant multiple communication paths for control of an actuator in response to an input signal. The analog output network includes at least two controllers 18, 20 , each of which is connected to an analog output circuit 38, 40 and a controller selector 36 which is connected to each of the controllers and the analog output circuits. The controller selector ensures that at least one of the analog output circuits is enabled at all times and identifies one of the controllers as an on line controller. The analog output circuit connected to the on line controller generates an actuation signal which passes through the actuator and the other analog output circuit. An alternate current path comprising a diode string 72 with a voltage drop larger than the voltage drop of the actuation signal in the other analog output circuit is provided so that, in the event an analog output circuit is removed or is defective, the actuation signal from the on line analog output circuit is still provided with a current path to control the actuator.
