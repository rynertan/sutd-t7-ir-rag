# POSITIVE TYPE RESIST POLYMER COMPOSITION AND METHOD OF MAKING RESIST PATTERNS.

## Abstract
A positive type resist polymer crosslinkable composition resistant to ionizing radiation or ultraviolet rays and com posed of the following units a , b and c respectively in a polymerized state a a unit derived from methacrylic acid ester which is represented by the formula CH₂ C CH₂ .COOR wherein R represents alkyl or haloalkyl radicals having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, benzyl radical or cyclohexyl radical , b a unit derived from monoolefinic unsaturated carboxylic acid hav ing 3 to 12 carbon atoms and 1 to 3 carboxylic radicals, and c a unit derived from methacrylic acid chloride. The quantity of unit b is such that the number of carboxyl radicals in each unit b multiplied by the molarity of the respective unit b is equal to about 10 to 20 molar percent of the total molarity of units a , b and c . The quantity of unit c is about 0.05 3.0 molar percent of the total molarity of units a , b and c . The ratio of molarity of unit b multiplied by the number of car boxy radicals in each unit b to the molarity of unit c is more than 2 1 but less than 25 1. The polymer composition is preferably a copolymer composed of units a , b and c or a composition consisting of a copolymer composed of a part of unit a and unit b and a copolymer consisting of the residual part of unit a with unit c .
