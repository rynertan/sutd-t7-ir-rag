# AN IMPROVED METHOD OF BUILDING CONSTRUCTION

## Abstract
A building method utilising the pozzolanic characteris tics of pulverised fuel ash by making blocks of such ash with cement and chalk or limestone curing the blocks and then bonding the cured blocks together with a mortar mix of the same materials in the same or different proportions from those used to make the blocks. A plaster having the same materials in the same or different proportions from those used to make the blocks may then be applied to the bonded blocks.
