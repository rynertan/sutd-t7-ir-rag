## Description
CHLORINE CELL DESIGN FOR ELECTROLYTE SERIES FLOW In U.S. Patents 4,197,179 and 4,269,675, there is disclosed a method and means for operating a plurality of chlor alkali membrane cells by flowing catholyte from cell to cell sequentially while countercurrently flowing anolyte from cell to cell sequentially. U.S. Patent 4,057,474 discloses a bank of cationic permselective membrane cells operated with series cell to cell flow of the catholyte. The cell is illustrated as having flat monopolar electrodes. Other patents which disclose electrolyte series flow are U.S. No. 1,284,618 U.S. No. 3,899,403 and German No. 24 37 783. The present invention resides in an electrolytic cell to provide electrolyte series flow in banks of membrane cells, especially those of bipolar electric conduction. The present invention also provides for electrolyte series flow in such membrane cells wherein the electrolyte flow from cell to cell is taken from a level above or near the tops of the electrodes of one cell and introduced to a level below the tops of the electrodes in the next cell in sequence. The invention further provides for electrolyte series flow in such cells by taking the electrolyte from de gassing compartments located atop the cells and introducing the electrolyte to the next succeeding cell at a location which is preferably below the top of the electrodes Another feature of the invention is to provide novel de gassing compartments for installation atop specially designed cell banks, the de gassing compartments containing means for causing electrolyte from a given cell to flow through down comers in the next succeeding cell in the bank, the gases in the de gassing compartments being preferably removed cumulatively. Banks or series of chlor alkali membrane cells are provided with means for flowing electrolyte from cell to cell in a manner such that electrolyte from a cell is taken from a point near the top or above the vertical electrodes in the cell and introduced to the corresponding electrolyte section in the next succeeding cell, preferably at a location below the top of the electrodes, the last cell of the series having flow means for removing the electrolyte to its subsequent destination. More particularly, the invention resides in a bank or series of chlor alkali electrolytic cells, wherein each cell comprises at least one electrode pair separated by a cation permselective, substantially hydraulically impermeable membrane, with means for flowing catholyte from cell to cell sequentially, and inlet and outlet means for flowing anolyte to and from each of said cells, characterized by inlet means for adding water or dilute caustic to the catholyte portion of a first cell of the bank or series, flow means for directing gas lifted catholyte liquor from said first cell to a de gassing compartment above said cathodes, flow means for directing at least a portion of the de gassed catholyte to a point below the surface of the catholyte liquor in the next successive cell while allowing at least a portion of the de gassed catholyte to re enter the cell from which it came, flow means for directing gas lifted catholyte liquor from said next successive cell and each additional successive cell in the series thereafter, to a de gassing compartment above the cathodes, at least a portion of the de gassed catholyte of each cell being directed to a next successive cell while allowing at least a portion of the de gassed catholyte to re enter the cell from which it came, flow means for directing de gassed catholyte liquor from the last cell of the bank or series, and flows means for removing cell gasses from the de gassing compartment. The invention also resides in means for flowing the anolyte from cell to cell sequentially, said means comprising inlet means for adding alkali metal chloride solution to the anolyte portion of a first cell of the bank or series, flow means for directing gas lifted anolyte liquor from said first cell to a de gassing compartment above said anodes, flow means for directing at least a portion of the de gassed anolyte to a point below the surface of the anolyte liquor in the next successive cell while allowing at least a portion of the de gassed anolyte to re enter the cell from which it came, flow means for directing gas lifted anolyte liquor from said next successive cell and each additional successive cell in the series thereafter, to a de gassing compartment above the anodes, at least a portion of the de gassed anolyte of each cell being directed to a next successive cell while allowing at least a portion of the de gassed anolyte to re enter the cell from which it came, flow means for directing de gassed anolyte liquor from the last cell of the bank or series, and flow means for removing cell gasses from the de gassing compartments. The following drawings are provided as visual aids for describing embodiments of the present invention. Figure 1 illustrates an exploded view not to scale of a cathode plate 1 , a membrane covered foraminous cathode 5 , a metal anode 11 , and an anode plate 14 Figure 2 illustrates an isometric view of a cell frame embodiment not to scale useful in constructing bipolar membrane cells for use in the present invention. Figure 3 illustrates a top view cross section of an embodiment not to scale comprising three cells arranged in a filter press type of arrangement with bipolar conduction of electricity through the cells. Figure 4 illustrates three cells connected by flow means for accomplishing cell to cell flow of electrolytes. Figure 5 illustrates three cells arranged in a manner somewhat similar to Fig. 4 but the compartments for separating cell gases from electrolyte are elevated above the cells. Figure 6 illustrates a generalized view of five cells arranged in filter press manner with the cell cover compartments shown in an exploded manner. Figure 7 illustrates a partial view of a cell to demonstrate the relative positioning of cell cover compartments such as shown in Figure 6. The banks or series of cells useful in the present invention are defined as monopolar or bipolar chlor alkali membrane cells having vertically disposed anodes and cathodes, wherein the electrodes are of a pocket or flat plate design, separated by a membrane.The membranes are cationic permselective and are substantially hydraulically impermeable. The cells, when installed as a bank of cells, are preferably bipolar in that electrical current flow occurs through conductors which are connected to the anodes of one cell and to the cathodes of the next adjacent cell, such as in U.S.Patent No. 2,282,058. In a preferred embodiment there is a space between the anode plate and the electricallyconjoined cathode plate wherein the bipolar coupling is made, said space serving as part of the catholyte compartment similar to U.S. Patent No. 2,282,058. The space within each of the pocket cathodes communicates through ports in the cathode plate with the catholyte compartment and is, therefore, a part of the catholyte compartment. Electrochemical current flow is from the cathode, by way of the bipolar electric coupling to the anode of the next adjacent cell and so on until the circuitry is completed by current flow from The last cathode or cathode plate in the bank of cells. The bank or series of cells may comprise any plural number of cells when the bipolar method of conducting electric current from cell to cell is used. The practical limit to the number of cells in a series is decided more by frictional factors pressure drop of the electrolyte liquors and by the practical volumetric limit of the flow means required to handle the quantity of liquors, than by the electrical considerations. A practical range is usually from 2 to 10 cells in a series, with 3 to 7 being preferred. Most preferably, a series of 5 cells is employed. Preferably, the series flow also sometimes called a cascade flow involves flowing both the anolyte and the catholyte, especially when such simultaneous series flows are done counter currently. Figure 1 illustrates an exploded view of a cathode plate 1 , a pocket cathode 5 , an anode II, and an anode plate 14 . The cathode plate 1 is shown as a metal plate 2 having sufficient thickness or construction to remain rigid in service. Bolt holes 3 and ports 4 are provided in the plate. The pocket cathode 5 is shown as a foraminous metal 8 which is bent or folded back to form two substantially parallel sides, the top end and bottom end being closed by metal portions 7 which may also be foraminous, the remaining side or edge being closed by a rigid member 7a which is provided with studs or bolts 10 and through which extend ports 9 to permit liquid flow to and from the inner space of the pocket cathode 5 .The cathode ports 9 are aligned with cathode plate ports 4 when the bolts 10 are positioned in the bolt holes 3 when assembled. The foraminous metal screen may be constructed as woven wire screen, but it may also be a punched plate or expanded slit plate, all of which are known in the art. A membrane 6 completely covers cathode 5 , except for rigid member 7a and there is normally little or no space between membrane 6 and foraminous metal 8 , depending on how tightly the membrane is installed and, at times, depending on whether the membrane stretches or shrinks during handling, storage, or operation. Complete tight blinding of the external surface of foraminous metal 8 by the membrane 6 is not generally recommended.The cathode configuration, often referred to as pocket type or pocket shape, is one in which the space within the cathode communicates only with the catholyte communication of liquid water with anolyte is substantially prevented by the substantially hydraulically impermeable membrane which covers the cathode on all sides except the side or edge which is attached to the cathode plate 1 . The number of bolts 10 and ports 9 in the cathode construction is not critical except of course there is to be a matching number of holes 3 and ports 4 in cathode plate 1 . In Figure 1 there is also illustrated an anode 11 which comprises, preferably, a foraminous metal sheet 12 bent or folded back to form substantially parallel sides, usually leaving the upper edge and lower edge open. The edge opposite the bent edge may be closed by a metal strip to which are attached studs or bolts 13 which are provided with threads at their terminal ends. The bolts 13 are aligned when assembled with bolt holes 16 in a metal plate 15 which comprises the anode plate 14 . Alternatively, the anode may be a sheet or slab which is solid or foraminous, instead of the folded back design, as shown. The cathodes 5 and anodes 11 are not required to be prepared by bending or folding a single sheet of metal back to form parallel sides, since one may also form the two sides by welding or otherwise fastening two sheets of metal to edge pieces to form the desired shape. Generally, however, the bend back or fold back method is preferable. Figure 2 illustrates a cell frame 20 , not to scale, having a top side 21 , a first vertical side 24 , a second vertical side 22 and a bottom side 23 . A portion of side 22 is cut away to reveal a cross sectional view of ridges 22a and 22b which protrude from the inner surfaces of all four sides.The purpose of ridges 22a and 22b will become more apparent from Fig 3, described hereinafter. In top side 21 there are two ports 27 for flow of degassed anolyte to downcomers 29 . Between ports 27 there is at least one port 28 for anolyte with gas to flow upwardly such as by gas lift and or mass flow from the anolyte space within cell frame 20 . When the cells are assembled and in operation the anolyte with gas which flows up through ports 28 is diverted to a next adjacent cell where it is degassed and then flows back downwardly through downcomer ports 27 where the anolyte flow is channeled down the outer portion of the next anolyte chamber by the action of flow downcomers 29 .Flow downcomers 29 are illustrated in Fig. 2 in an exploded view, only one such diverter being shown, although it is easily recognized that there is, preferably, a downcomer 29 for each downcomer hole 27 . When assembled in place, the downcomer 29 is positioned to communicate directly with hole or port 27 by means of, e.g., an attachment or insert piece 29a , causing the anolyte to flow downwardly between the ridges 22a and 22b to a point below the upper portion of the anolyte space within cell frame 20 . Other configurations for the downcomers may be employed and, in fact, it is possible to build downcomers directly into the cell frame.Ports 25 and 26 serve as catholyte flow means whereby catholyte flow travels from cell to cell by gravity flow down one port, say 25 in a given cell frame and by gas lift back up the opposite port, say 26 of the same cell frame, where it then flows back down through a corresponding catholyte flow port of the next cell frame in the series. The majority of the liquor carried up into the covers by gas 50 and 51 ofFig. 6 through slots 25 and 26 is returned to the catholyte compartments through slots 25 and 26 , the flow being separated by weir baffles see 85 of Fig.7 . It is to be understood, of course, that the electrolyte flow to the first cell of a bank or series is from an external source and that the electrolyte flow from the last cell of a bank or series is taken from the series for further handling, but that the electrolyte flow within the series is from cell to cell. Side ports 29b may be used when frame 20 is used as inFig. 4. In order to readily accomodate the cell covers shown in Figures 6 and 7, it is preferred inFig. 2, that anolyte ports 27 be located closer to the middle of top side 21 than the catholyte ports 25 and 26 , substantially in a manner as shown inFigures 2 and 7. With reference to Fig. 3 there is illustrated a series of three cell frames 20 , viewed in cross section from the top. Within each cell frame 20 there are mounted a plurality only 4 are shown in each frame of anodes 11 interleaved from opposite directions with a plurality only 3 are shown in each frame of membrane covered cathodes 5 . The cathodes 5 are assembled into place and supported by cathode plates 1 . The anodes 11 are assembled into place and supported by anode plates 14 . The means for attaching anodes and cathodes to their respective plates are, e.g., the bolts shown in Fig. 1. Electrical circuitry is provided by attaching the electrode bolts to conductive couplings preferably copper couplings substantially as illustrated. The coupling of cathodes of one frame to the anodes of another frame carries the electric current from frame to frame. In operation of the embodiment shown in Fig. 3, anolyte is in anolyte portions 33 and catholyte is in catholyte portions 32 as well as within the pocket cathodes 5 which communicate, via ports 4 within cathode plates 1 to said catholyte portions 32 , substantially as illustrated in Fig. 1.The cathode plates 1 are tightly sealed in place against ridges 22b to avoid mingling of anolyte and catholyte, while anode plates 14 are sealed in place against ridges 22a for the same purpose. The seal or gasket 22c may be an inert rubber, plastic, or mastic, preferably one which is substantially inert and long lived in the cell environment and conditions. The series of cell frames 20 are usually sealed at their conjoined faces and tightly squeezed together by a bolt means or clamp means not shown to avoid leakage from the joints. Squeezing together of the cell frames also squeezes together the conductive couplings e.g.34 and 35 . Area 36 is dead space, housing only the conductive couplings carrying electric current to the first set of anodes. End section 30 is a cathode buss plate and end section 31 is an anode buss plate.In Figure 3, the cathode plate 1 has optionally, but preferably, a vertically mounted baffle or flow divider 85 which is affixed to the plate at a position outside the end cathode at each end this flow divider 85 extends above the cathode plate so that when mounted in a cell frame of Figure 2, the flow divider 85 splits ports 25 and 26 into two portions. Figure 4 is an illustration to show cell to cell flow, countercurrently, of anolyte and catholyte in an alternate embodiment. It illustrates that anolyte or brine is fed through conduit 40 into the top or near the top of the anolyte portion of cell frame 20A and flows from cell 20A to cell 20B through flow means 41 , then from cell 20B to cell 20C through flow means 42 , then from cell 20C through flow means 43 .The catholyte flows countercurrently to the anolyte, by entering cell 20C as catholyte or water at flow means 44 which is at or near the top of the catholyte portion of cell 20C , then flows from cell 20C to cell 20B through flow means 45 , then from cell 20B to cell 20A through flow means 46 , then from 20A through flow means 47 . It will be understood, of course, that in each cell frame the anolyte portions are separated from the catholyte portions by substantially hydraulically impermeable membranes. The cells illustrated in Fig. 4 may be of the monopolar type or may be of the bipolar type. The cells in Fig. 4 need not be spread apart as illustrated, but may be closely pressed one against another such as in Fig. 3, especially when bipolar series electrical circuitry is desired. Cell gases from the anolyte portions are collected in a header 48 and cell gases from the catholyte portions are collected in a header 49 . The levels of anolyte and catholyte in the Fig.4 cells are controlled somewhat by the flow rates, but primarily by the locations of the flow means which carry them to and from each cell, the separations of cell gases de frothing in each cell being permitted by the head space above the electrolytes in each cell. Figure 5 illustrates an alternate embodiment of a kind of flow arrangement similar to that shown inFig. 4, except that the separations of cell gases from the electrolytes in each cell are accomplished in separate compartments mounted atop the cells. Electrolytes are conveyed to the respective compartments through conduits from the anolyte portions and the catholyte portions. Figure 6 is an exploded view of a series of five cell frames 20 arranged in bipolar, filter press manner in order to demonstrate cooperation with novel cell covers. The cell frames 20 are of the type such as illustrated in Fig. 2, the bipolar filter press arrangement being substantially as shown in Fig. 3. When assembled, catholyte cell covers 50 and 51 are conveniently arranged, respectively to communicate with the top of a near side of the cell series shown here as 5 cells , and with the top of the corresponding opposed far side of the cell series. The covers are substantially open on the underside, having the general appearance of inverted closed end troughs. Within cover 50 there is shown a series of tall spaced apart upright baffles separated by spaces which each contain a short weir type baffle.Running lengthwise and about midway of cover 50 there is a short baffle which is not only a part of the catholyte flow directors, but may also serve beneficially as a strengthening means for the tall and short baffles. Cover 51 is quite similar to cover 50 , but the baffle arrangements are different in cover 51 there is a series of short baffles separated by spaces which each have a tall baffle. Thus where cover 51 has a tall baffle, the corresponding baffle directly across from it in cover 50 is a short baffle, Anolyte cover 52 has the general appearance of an inverted trough, but is shown here as being wider than catholyte cover 50 or 51 it is designed in this illustration with appropriate baffles to serve the five cells 20 .When assembled onto the cell series, covers 50 , 51 , and 52 are sealed by use of gasketing, mastic, cell putty or other appropriate sealing means to avoid leakage of electrolytes from under the covers to outside the cells. The ends of the cell series are capped by buss plates 30 and 31 such as illustrated in Fig.3, cathode buss plate 30 serving as a wall portion of an end catholyte portion, and anode buss plate 31 serving as a wall portion for the opposite end.Electrical circuitry is provided for the cell series ofFig. 6 substantially in accordance with that shown inFig. 3. When assembled, charged with appropriate electrolytes, and in operation, catholyte or water flow in the cell series of Fig. 6 is conducted through inlet flow means 53 into the first baffled section of cover 50 from where it enters the first catholyte portion through port 26 . Because it cannot flow over the tall baffle, the catholyte flow from the said first catholyte portion is forced up through port 25 into cover 51 where the catholyte flows over the short l weir type baffle and back down into the second catholyte portion. From the second catholyte portion the liquor flows up into cover 50 into the second baffled section, then across the short weir type baffle to the third catholyte portion and so on, up, across, and down between covers 50 and 51 through cells 20 until it reaches the end of its journey and flows out of flow means 54 from cover 51 . Catholyte flow means 54 may be fitted with an adjustable leg so that the catholyte level may be adjusted above or below the anolyte level in cover 52 as the operating conditions require. The anolyte level in cover 52 may also be raised or lowered by use of an adjustable leg at outlet flow means 65 .At the same time, anolyte flows countercurrently to the catholyte flow in the cell series, by being conducted as brine or anolyte through inlet flow means 58 and 59 which communicate with anolyte ports 27A and 27B in the cell which is the last cell with respect to catholyte flow, but which is the first cell with respect to the anolyte flow. The anolyte in the first anolyte portion is forced up into cover 52 through anolyte ports 28 and is directed by baffling to corresponding ports 27A and 27B into the second anolyte portions. In each of the anolyte portions there are, preferably, downcomers such as shown in Fig. 2 to cause the anolyte liquor to merge with the anolyte in the cell at a point below the surface of the anolyte, preferably near the bottom of the anolyte portion.The anolyte cover 52 contains corner baffles 62 to form a compartment for each of flow means 58 and 59 , the area between the two corner baffles defining a space communicating with the first set of anolyte ports 28 . It is not essential that there be more than one downcomer hole in each anolyte portion, but better anolyte mixing and circulation within each anolyte portion is achieved by having more than one downcomer hole, especially if they are oppositely disposed from each other. The anolyte flowing from upcomer holes 28 is directed by baffling means 63 to the downcomer holes in the next adjacent cell through openings 60 between the baffles, this manner of anolyte flow proceeding through the cell series until the anolyte from the final set of upcomer holes 28 flows out through flow means 65 .The exact configuration of baffles 63 is not critical, so long as the baffling causes flow of anolyte from upcomer holes in one cell to the downcomer holes in the next cell, except of course, when the anolyte flow is removed from the last set of upcomer holes. The baffles 63 are solidly connected to the inner surfaces of the side walls of cover 52 , but there is a common head space for cell gases above the baffles within the anolyte cover cell gases can exit through vent 57 to a collector. Only one such vent 57 is shown, but it is within the purview of this invention to have more than one such vent in each anolyte cover. Vents 55 and 56 are also provided in the catholyte covers to remove catholyte cell gases to a collector. The depleted anolyte from flow means 65 in anolyte cover 52 may be, if desired, re strenghtened with alkali metal halide e.g.NaCl and recirculated, along with any desired make up anolyte, back to a cell series.In the baffles 63 and 64 in anolyte cover 52 there are small openings 61 at the bottom near the downcomer holes to permit some mixing of.anolyte in the downcomer area and upcomer area of a given cell. These small holes 61 recirculate the excess anolyte carried up into cover 52 by gas lift, thus offsetting any tendency for the gas lift to pump down the anolyte level within cell 20 . Figure 7 depicts a top view of a portion of a cell series, not to scale, with cut away portions, to illustrate the approximate position of the catholyte covers and anolyte cover of Fig. 6. There are major portions of two cell frames 20A and 20B tightly abutted along line 70 . On one side there is shown a portion of catholyte cover 51 , a portion of which is cut away to reveal baffles therein and to reveal a catholyte port 25a which is in the top of frame 20A . The baffles in the illustrated portion of cover 51 may, depending on which part of the cell series is considered to be depicted, represent a short weir type baffles 71 and a tall baffle 73 or may represent tall baffles 71 with a short weir type baffle 73 . A cell gasket joint 72 is depicted.The long baffle 74 serves to separate the froth flowing up into the cover from the de gassed liquor flowing back down into the cell and is generally about the same height as the short weir type baffles. The long baffle 74 is located above the catholyte compartment baffle 85 shown in Fig. 7 and in Fig. 3 this baffle 85 separates the upflow of froth i.e., gas and liquor from the downflow of liquor into the catholyte compartment, thereby obtaining some internal recirculation within each catholyte cell compartment. Above the anolyte ports 28 , 27A , and 27B there is depicted an anolyte cover 52 with a portion cut away to reveal some of the said anolyte ports and to reveal baffles 63 which are within the cover but which rest solidly on top of frames 20A and 20B .The relatively small, flow holes 61 at or near the bottom of baffles 63 are also shown these allow the excess anolyte carried up into the cover 52 in the froth gas lift to flow back down into the cell it came out of, thereby obtaining some internal recirculation within each anolyte cell compartment. It can be seen that anolyte from upcomer holes 28 in frame 20B is directed, by the baffles, to downcomer holes 27A and 27B of frame 20A . For purposes of illustrating an additional possible embodiment of the invention, there is shown a conduit or pipe 80 which may be positioned between covers 51 and 52 or which may be slightly elevated above such a position.The pipe or conduit 80 may serve either to bring electrolyte to the cell series or to remove cell gases from the series there are, obviously, many piping arrangements which may be used to carry electrolytes to and from the cell series and to remove cell gases from the cell series. The inverted trough type of cell covers may, obviously, have rounded tops or other such configuration so long as there is sufficient height of the covers to provide head space to accomodate collapse of the liquor gas froth i.e., for de frothing or de gassing which is likely to be carried into the covers through the upcomer holes, said head space extending at least slightly above the baffles in the cell cover portion from which gases are to be removed. Preferably, and beneficially, the head space extends the full length of each cover in order that only one gas exit is needed for the entire cover. In Figure 7, opposite the side where catho lyte cover 51 is shown, the catholyte cover is not shown, but cross hatched areas 81 and 82 are indicated to show where a corresponding catholyte cover would be if it were shown. In that catholyte cover area, a cut away reveals anodes and cathodes mounted on their respective mounting plates in position against ridges 22a and 22b and showing bipolar electrical hook ups from anodes of frame 20B to cathodes of frame 20A , the space in which the hook ups are shown being the catholyte portion 32 of frame 20B which is served by catholyte port 26A , all substantially as described hereinbefore. The said catholyte portion 32 of frame 20B also communicates with catholyte within the cathodes of cell 20A by way of ports in the cathode plate to which the said cathodes are mounted. Baffle 85 serves to separate the upflow of froth catholyte and gas from the downflow of excess catholyte. It is preferred that the anolyte up flow ports 28 of Fig. 2 have dimensions which provide greater than about 0.0258 cm2 0.004 in.2 of cross sectional flow of froth per ampere of current capacity and that the down flow ports 27 have dimensions which provide greater than about 0.0516 cm2 0.002 in.2 of cross sectional flow of de gassed anolyte per ampere of current capacity. Also, referring to Fig. 2, it is preferred that catholyte ports 25 and 26 provide essentially about the same catholyte flow capacities as used for the anolyte flow. The methods and principals of the present invention are applicable in providing cell to cell or series to series flow of electrolytes in other embodiments of chlor alkali membrane cells of monopolar or bipolar circuitry and of flat plate electrode or pocket electrode designs.
