# Graphical display apparatus with pipelined processors.

## Abstract
A graphics display apparatus employs a general pur pose or main microprocessor 4 providing general control of the apparatus including receiving high level graphic orders defining a desired graphic image from a host proces sor and dedicated graphics microprocessor 28 connected to receive low level graphic orders from the general micro processor 4 along a pipeline constituted by a shared buffer store 27 . Pipeline control logic 37 controls the pipeline by blocking the graphics processor 28 which generally op erates more quickly than the general processor 4 until the latter has completed computation of all the low level orders associated with a particular high level order. The front of screen performance can be further improved by backing up the pipeline to repeat certain low level orders rather than by obtaining these repeated orders by recomputation. Graphics hardware 31 controlled by the graphics proces sor 28 loads appropriate bit patterns into an all points addressable refresh buffer 32 for subsequent display on a cathode ray tube monitor 3 .
