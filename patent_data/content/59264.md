## Abstract
The invention provides a unique sub micron dimen sioned NPN type transistor and method of making the same wherein hundreds of such transistors may be fabricated on a single chip with each transistor comprising an active region surrounded by field oxide completely isolating it from the substrate and its effects on operation. Slots made in the substrate permit angle evaporation of etch resist to protect the active region while it is disconnected from the substrate by etching therebeneath via the slots. Substrate oxidation supports the active regions while orthogonal slots are provided permitting access to opposed sides of the active regions for doping P which is driven in from one side only while N is introduced and driven in from both sides, thereby providing an N P P, N emitter, base, collector transistor active region to which electrical connections are applied using conventional techniques, providing almost complete reduction of the parasitic capacitances and resist ances because of the total oxide isolation of the active regions from the substrate.

## Description

From these techniques, the novel structure and method for the NPN lateral transistor with greatly reduced parasitic capacitance and resistances is achieved.Summary of the Invention The invention is a novel lateral NPN type transistor formed on a substrate by orthogonal slots which define each active region and permit doping of the active regions via opposed slots while supported by oxidation achieved through underlying etching of each active region in a semi array of regions supported at spaced apart positions and totally isolated from the substrate by substrate oxidation Electrical connections are conventionally made to the Nf emitter,P P base and N collector.

It should be realized that the active region may be completely contained with the surface of area of 3d x 5d or 15d2 wherein d is only 0.4 micrometers. The isolated region is completely separated from the substrate by oxidation and the parasitic capacitances and resistances are almost completely reduced to a minimum value attainable because the transistor is reduced essentially to just its electronically active region whereas in the conventional vertical transistor, the electrically active region is only a very small fraction of the total transistor area.The dielectric isolation between transistors offered by the same substrate oxidation has advantages with respect to high frequency performance, high voltage integrated circuits, radiation resistance, circuit flexibility, i.e.the process can provide NPN, PNP, JFET, MOSFET s etc. on the same integrated circuit chip. In FIG. 1 there is shown a silicon substrate of the P type, having patterned photoresist applied to an upper surface thereof.The pattern may simply comprise longitudinal slots for rendering the photoresist 23 alternately soluble and it may be seen that the soluble photoresist has been removed to provide exposure of the substrate 21 so that the slots 25 and 27 may be milled therein or formed by O.D.E.etching process. These slots 25 and 27 penetrate the upper surface of the silicon substrate 21 sufficiently deeply that they extend beneath the depth of the region which will ultimately become the active regions for the various transistors. In FIG. 3, the photoresist layer 23 has been removed and the structure is shown in perspective thereby showing the slots 25 and 27 extending inwardly of the upper surface of silicon substrate 21. In FIG. 4 it may be appreciated why the slots 25 and 27 are necessary. They permit angle evaporation of etch resist 31 to the edges of the slots 5 and 27. The result provides a protective covering over the tops of the active regions being formed. Also, it should be noted that due to the angle of evaporation of the etch resist 31, this protective layer only extends to a certain depth within slots 25 and 27, but this depth must be adequate to protect the active regions being formed. Thus, in FIG. 5, it may be seen that the active regions are generally shown at 35, 37 and 39 above the silicon substrate etch level 41 and also above the etch levels 35 , 37 and 39 where the etch introduced through the slots 25 and 27 removed the substrate from beneath the active regions 35, 37 and 39. Actually, there are a plurality of active regions aligned in the remaining portions 35, 37 and 39 which represent semi arrays of transistors being formed. Obviously, the semi arrays are supported at their ends or spaced apart positions so that the active regions do not collapse into the substrate etched space 41. In FIG. 6 it may be seen that the etch resist 31 has been removed and the silicon has been oxidized to 5102 shown at 41 as filling all the voids between regions 35, 37 and 39 and the silicon substrate 21.Thus, with the regions supported now by the silicon oxide 41, the orthogonally related sets of slots 45 and 47 may be formed as illustrated in the top plan view of FIG. 7. The procedure for forming these slots is the same as before, requiring a photoresist layer patterned in the form of spaced apart slots and the silicon material either ion milled away or etched using O.D.E. techniques, as best shown in FIG. 8. In FIG. 8 the application of P doping is achieved by boron implant shown by the arrows 49 to produce the P region 51. It should be noted that this implanting is done only into the corresponding right hand edges of slots 45 and 47 to provide the P layers 51 and 53. In FIG. 9 it may be seen that the P regions have been driven in, such as by using high heat so that they are expanded as shown by 51 and 53 . Also, a further P region is visible to the left at 55 , having been produced by a slot to the left of the margin of the page. Next in FIG. 9 it will be seen that phosphorus is implanted or deposited into both edges of each slot as shown by the arrows 57 to provide the N regions 61, 62, 63 and 64. It may also be pointed out that the P regions 21 , 21 and 21 are the remaining regions from the original P type silicon substrate. Proceeding from FIG. 9 to FIG. 10, it may be seen that the phosphorus N regions 62 and 63 have now been driven in to comprise the expanded regions 62 and 63 . Accordingly the P region has been changed in size and is now designated 51 as is also true of the remaining P region now identified as 21 l The region 62 will comprise the emitter with the regions 51 and 21 comprising a graded base region and finally region 63 being the collector region. Also, in FIG. 10 it may be seen that the substrate has again been oxidized to fill in the slots 45 and 47 and provide a covering over the active region of the electrodes generally shown at 75. The doping gradient in the base region is similar to convention double diffused transistors. A finished transistor shown in FIG. 11 wherein the contacts 101, 102 and 103 are provided from a metallization layer for the emitter 111, base 112 and collector 113 respectively. These contacts are fabricated simply by conventional techniques for patterning or metallization, It may be seen that the transistor comprising these three electrodes is surrounded by moats of silicon oxide formed in the slots 25,27 and 45,47. Thus, the transistor is isolated from adjacent transistors or other elements. The active region of the transistor is visible in FIG. 12 and perspective showing the emitter 111 base 112 and collector 113. While modifications may readily appear to those skilled in the art, it is intended that the scope of the invention be defined in the appended claims, wherein
