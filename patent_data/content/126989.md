# Fluid pressure transmitter.

## Abstract
A fluid differential pressure transmitter assembly in cludes a housing 2, 10 having a spacer 34 within the housing to minimize the internal fill fluid used to conduct fluid pressure from a fluid inlet port 4 to a pressure responsive diaphragm 26 . Input pressures are applied to respective sides of the diaphragm 26 to produce an electrical signal output representative of the differential pressure from piezoresistive elements deposited on the diaphragm. The sensor 26 is electrically connected by flexible wires 30 to electrically conductive paths 32 supported on an end surface 32 of the spacer 34 . The conductive paths are, in turn, electrically connected to electrode wires 38 at electrically conductive support junc tions 48 between the spacer 34 and the electrode wires 38 . However, the spacer 34 is supported on the electrode wires 38 at the support junctions 48 in a free floating arrangement without any other physical contact to either adjacent elements within the housing or the interior wall of the housing. Thus, physical changes to the spacer such as those occasioned by temperature changes are not transmit ted to the fluid seals 42 . The electrode wires 38 are arranged to pass through fluid tight seals 42 in the transmitter housing to provide external electrical connect ions to the sensor while supporting the spacer within the housing.
