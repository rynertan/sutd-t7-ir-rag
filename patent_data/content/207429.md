# INPUT CIRCUIT FOR FET LOGIC

## Abstract
An OR AND logic circuit includes a plurality of OR gates 34, 36 wherein each OR gate includes a plurality of source coupled FETs 60,62 66,68 and the inputs to each OR gate are the control gates of the FETs. A logic node 46,48 serves as the output for each OR gate 34, 50, 62 36, 66, 68 . A unidirectional current conducting means, such as a Schottky diode 72, 74 , is connected to each output logic node 46, 48 of each OR gate. One terminal of each unidirectional current conducting means is connected to a common logic node 52 . Current passing through a load means 76 passes through the common logic node 52 and is divided among the unidi rectional current conducting means so that a logical AND function is provided at the common logic node 52 with the logic condition at the output logic nodes 46, 48 of the OR gates serving as the inputs to the AND gates. Multiple levels of such OR AND circuits can be provided with the AND output of one level serving as the input to an OR gate of the next stage .
