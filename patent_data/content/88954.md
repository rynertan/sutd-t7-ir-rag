# Apparatus for use in stroke treatment utilizing extravascular circulation of oxygenated synthetic nutrients to treat tissue hypoxic and ischemic disorders.

## Abstract
A novel acute care cerebral support system and method for treating severly ischemic brains is disclosed wherein an oxygenated nutrient emulsion is circulated through at least a portion of the ventriculo subarachnoid spaces. The nutrient emulsion contains an oxygenatable non aqueous compo nent, an aqueous nutrient component, an emulsification component, and other components which render physiolo gic acceptability to the nutrient emulsion. The disclosed system and method have been shown to effectively ex change oxygen, carbon dioxide, glucose, and other metabo lites in severely stroked brains. Significant restoration of oxidative metabolism and electrographic activity result from the disclosed treatment. Methods for producing the nutrient emulsion and a system for delivering that emulsion to the cerebrospinal pathway are also disclosed. Additionally, novel diagnostic methods for diagnosing the physiologic state of hypoxicischemic and other diseased neurologic tissue during treatment are provided.
