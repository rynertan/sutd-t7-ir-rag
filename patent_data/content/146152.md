# Solderable palladium nickel coatings.

## Abstract
A permanently solderable palladium nickel electroplat ed coating is formed on electrically conductive surfaces. The coating has a first alloy layer of 46 to 82 atomic percent palladium and 18 to 54 atomic percent nickel. This first layer is covered by a continuous second layer of 96 to 100 atomic percent metallic palladium and 0 4 atomic percent nickel. The second layer has a thickness of up to 2 nm.
