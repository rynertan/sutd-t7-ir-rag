# Process for the preparation of magnesium nitrate hexahydrate.

## Abstract
Magnesium nitrate hexahydrate is prepared by suspend ing magnesiumoxide in melted magnesium nitrate hexahydrate at a temperature in excess of 90 C, adding a nitric acid solu tion whilst stirring, filtering the liquid reaction mixture, dis charging part of the clear filtrate as product, and utilizing the balance of the filtrate as liquid medium for further conversion. By this process a very pure product is obtained, which is preferably used for thermal stabilization of ammonium nitrate.
