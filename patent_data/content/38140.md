# Catalytic hydrocracking.

## Abstract
Catalytic hydrocracking of polynuclear aromatic con taining feedstocks is conducted over a catalyst com prising a nickel tungsten hydrogenation component and a crystalline zeolite having a silica to alumina mole ratio of at least 12, a constraint index of from 1 to 12, an alpha value of from 25 to 200 and a crystallite size of less than 0.05 micron.
