# Variable dwell I.C. engine ignition system.

## Abstract
A dwell control for an ignition system of the general type including a closed loop control which operates to vary the instant after each spark at which energy storage is commenced for the next spark. At low speeds the closed loop control is overridden and the circuit output Q44 is operated at constant duty ratio. Switch over between the two modes of operation is effected under the control of a bistable circuit Q18, Q19 which is set to one state in which a variable timer C1, Q2, Q3, Q4 incorporated in the closed loop control determines the instant of energy storage commencement, whenever the time duration for which the energy stored exceeds a threshold in less than a predetermined duration. The bistable is set to its other state, to provide fixed duty cycle operation, whenever the timer period exceeds a limiting value, or when a pulse arrives at the circuit input Q1 from a transducer 10 before the expiry of the timer period. This control scheme for the bistable prevents undesirable hunting between the two operating modes.

## Description
VARIABLE DWELL I.C. ENGINE IGNITION SYSTEMThis invention relates to a variable dwell i.c. engine ignition system.Generally. speaking i.c. engine ignition systems operate by building up a store of energy for a period and then releasing the energy quickly to provide a spark. The conventional contact breaker coil ignition system utilises a contact breaker driven by the engine to control the flow of current in a coil primary. Energy release is provided by interrupting the coil current at the required instant of ignition. The phase of the ignition sparks is varied mechanically by the contact breaker in accordance with engine parameters such as speed and air intake mainfold pressure and the mechanical arrangement for speed and vacuum timing control have become very sophisticated over a long period of development.More recently there have been many proposals for controlling the timing of the ignition sparks electronically and in such proposals, mechanical vacuum and speed timing control is unnecessary. However, there exists a demand for hybrid systems in which timing control is effected mechanically, but electronic circuits control the actual coil current. Thus, for example, the conventional contact breaker may replaced by a transducer which is driven by the engine and which incorporates conventional speed and vacuum timing controls. Such a transducer may be, for example, one relying on variable reluctance, on Hall effect, or on other non contact switching arrangements, the transducer providing a pulse train of constant duty ratio with the trailing edges of the pulses marking the desired instants of ignition.Clearly, such a transducer simulates the conventional contact breaker, but avoids its mechanical problems such as contact bounce, wear, contact erosion, etc.Because of the fixed duty ratio of the transducer pulse train, if the leading edge of each pulse is used to turn the coil current on, as with a conventional contact breaker system the coil on time will be a fixed proportion of the cycle time and hence will reduce as speed increases. This involves making a compromise between very inefficient operation at low speed and an inadequate on time at high speeds. To overcome this problem it has already been proposed, e.g. in UK A 2113761 to vary the coil duty ratio in accordance with the duration of the interval between the transducer pulses so as to increase the fractional coil on time as speed increases. A closed loop correction system was employed to provide a relatively slow correction to maintain the proportion of each cycle for which the coil current was above a set level substantially constant in steady running.The previously proposed apparatus was found to be too sensitive to the jitter which was found to occur when a chain drive from the engine to the transducer was used, particularly if the chain was improperly tensioned.It is an object of the present invention to provide a variable dwell i.c. engine ignition spark ignition system which can operate satisfactorily when in the presence of substantial timing jitter and which also is relatively insensitive to supply voltage variations.In accordance with the invention there is provided a dwell control for an ignition system employing a transducer driven by the engine and producing a pulse train of approximately constant duty ratio and including mechanical means for varying the phase of the pulse train relative to the engine cycle in accordance with engine operating conditions, energy storage means controlled by said transducer for releasing energy to create ignition sparks in synchronism with specific events in said pulse train, means sensitive to different specific events in said pulse train for commencing an energy storage period in each ignition cycle at relatively low engine speeds, timer means operating at relatively high engine speeds and operating under the control of said transducer to commence said energy storage period at an instant in each cycle earlier than said different specific event, the timing period of said timer being determined by closed loop control means so as to regulate the fractional time during which the energy stored by said energy storage means exceeds a threshold value, characterised by mode selection bistable switch means for determining whether or not said timer or said different specific event is to cause commencement of said energy storage period, said bistable switch means being switched to a state in which said timer causes commencement of said energy storage period whenever the time duration for which the energy stored by said energy storage means exceeds a threshold value is less than a predetermined duration and to its other state in which said different specific events cause commencement of the energy storage period either when timing period of the timer exceeds a limiting value or when said different specific event occurs before expiry of the timing period of said timer.Where the energy storage means is a coil, the energy storage period is commenced by completing a path for coil current and, in this case, the closed loop control means senses the coil current and determines the timer timing period so that the coil current is above a threshold level for a predetermined proportion of the cycle duration.The accompanying drawing is an electrical circuit diagram of one example of a variable dwell i.c. engine ignition system in accordance with the invention.The system shown includes a transducer 10 which senses the angular position of a conventional mechanically timed ignition distributor.

The collector of transistor Q42 is connected to the base of an npn transistor Q43, which has its collector connected to rail 11 and its emitter connected by two resistors R67, R68 in series to rail 13.The junction of resistors R67, R68 is connected to the base of an npn integrated Darlington type output transistor Q44 which has its emitter connected to rail 13 by a current sensing resistor R69 and its collector connected via the ignition coil primary winding 14 to the raw supply 15. The emitter of transistor Q40 is connected to the emitter of transistor Q44 SO that transistor Q40 starts to turn off whenever the voltage across resistor R69 rises to that across resistor R51.A pnp transistor Q45 has its emitter connected to rail 11, its base connected to the junction of two resistorsR72, R71 in series between the emitter of transistorQ43 and rail 11, and its collector connected to the anode of diode D7.In operation transistor Q1 operates to invert the negative going output pulses from the transducer 10.Thus following each transducer pulse capacitor C1 has the potential of its said one side pulled down to approximately one diode voltage drop above ground, cutting off transistors Q8 and Q6 in consequence. At low and medium speeds this has the effect of cutting off transistors Q3 and Q4 and capacitor C1 subsequently discharges linearly via transistor Q2 acting as a constant current source, until transistor Q4 turns on, whereupon transistor Q3 shunts the emitter resistor R4 of transistor Q2 This increases the charging rate of capacitor C1, which charges up by about 1 volt more, after which its other side becomes clamped when transistor Q6 turns on, at which point the timer constituted by the capacitor C1 and various transistors controlling its charge, has timed out.During the transducer pulse, the potential of the other side of capacitor C1 remains clamped whilst that of the one side rises until clamped by transistor Q8 which forms part of a Darlington voltage follower driven by the voltage on capacitor C2. This voltage therefore controls the delay between the transducer pulse trailing edge and the turning on of the transistor Q6, this delay increasing in response to increases in the control voltage. At sufficiently low values of the control voltage, the potential of the other side of capacitor C1, is not lowered sufficiently to turn off transistor Q4 hence the augmented charging rate provided by transistor Q3 is operative throughout the timer s action. This enables the coil off time to be controlled over a sufficiently wide range of non zero values.Under normal operating conditions of the timer transistor Q7 is non conductive. During dwell control operation to be described hereinafter however, when the voltage across capacitor C2 approaches the value at which maximum time delay is produced, transistors Q7 and Qg turn on to provide detection of a timer outranged condition.When transistor Q13 is conductive ie in a timer controlled turn on condition , diode D4 is non conductive, and the voltage on capacitor C2 is controlled by transistors Qll and Q12 Both of these are held off by transistor Q14 except during the transducer pulses. Transistor Q12 is held off unless transistor Ql6 is saturated, i.e. unless transistor Q15 is on. This condition is met during transducer pulses only if the current limit to be explained hereinafter is in control hence transistor Q12 acting as a constant current source is turned on only when the current limit is in control during transducer pulses. Transistor Qll. which acts as a constant current sink, is held off when transistor Q15 is conducting, so that it is operative only when the current limit is not in control during transducer pulses. The magnitudes of the sink and source currents have a ratio of about 2 1, so that in steady state the current limit is in operation for about two thirds of the transducer pulse duration, i.e. about 10 of the ignition cycle period.When the dwell control loop is not in operation the voltage on capacitor C2 is pre conditioned by means of transistor Q13 and diode D4. Diode D5 prevents pre conditioning from being applied during transducer pulses, thereby leaving the dwell control voltage undisturbed if the timer is pre empted by the transducer pulse as a result of rapid acceleration at low engine speeds in dwell control.Under engine running conditions, transistors Q30, Q32 are held off and current passing via diode strapped transistor Q33 provides a reference voltage for the current control loop. This loop is gated by transistorQ39 which when off enables the current control loop transistors Q40, Q41, Q42 Q43 and Q44, which all operate in saturation until coil current has risen to a value at which the voltage across resistor R69 causes these stages to desaturate in succession as the current limit comes into control. When transistor Q43 is unsaturated, transistor Q45 is switched on, thereby signalling when the output stage is either in current limit or not conducting at all.Capacitor C5 and resistor R73 control the high frequency gain of the current limit amplifier.The command signal for coil switching operates via transistors Q34 Q362 Q37 and 439 with transistor Q38 providing a brief hold off pulse lasting about 0.3mS in order to prevent spurious coil turn on due to spark interference. This hold off pulse is also used to turn on the mode control switch Q18 Ql9 and it also ensures that transistor Q31 is held on despite spark interference, thereby assuring undisturbed measurement of current limit duration by the associated circuit.Transistor Q31 conducts only when the coil is off.Consequently, during each transducer pulse, transistorQ31 is off and transistors Q27 and Q28 are latched on, thereby holding off transistors Q26 and 025. The lower side of capacitor C3 is therefore held near ground potential as it discharges, initially at about 1A. If the mode control bistable switch is off, transistor Q29 turns off when current limit is reached, causing capacitor C3 to be discharged additionally at about lOOyA. If the period of this augmented discharge falls short of about lmS, transistors Q27 and Q28 remain on when transistor Q31 turns on, and capacitorC3 is recharged rapidly.If the lms threshold is exceeded, the base potential of the transistor Q27 is raised above that of transistor Q26 when transistor Q31 turns on, resulting in transistors Q27 and Q28 turning off and transistors Q26 and Q25 turning on. In this event capacitor C3 recharges relatively slowly, enabling a modest excess of current limit duration above the threshold value to produce an output from transistor Q25 outlasting the coil hold off pulse.At a voltage on capacitor C3 lower than the threshold for switching off transistors Q27, Q28 the augmented discharge current resulting when transistor Q29 is non conducting is removed by means of diodes Dg, D10, and capacitor C3 continues to discharge at about 1 A. After about 300mS, transistors Q30 and Q32 turn on and follow the voltage of capacitor C3, shutting down the current limit control reference and thereby smoothly turning off the coil current without creating a spark.The coil current thus turns off under control and without a spark being created following an engine stall.The transistors Q22. Q23 and Q24 form a bistable circuit which delivers an output from transistor Q22 if the negative going transducer pulse applied to its base occurs before it is shorted out by the positive going coil turn on signal applied via diode D12. If transistor Q22 is turned on by the transducer pulse occurring first, then transistor Q23 is held on, thereby sustaining the output until the end of the transducer pulse. The output is used via transistor Q21 to turn off the mode control bistable switch tis1 Ql9 for the duration of any transducer pulse which pre empts the timer. It also provides for this period, a discharge current via transistor Q20 for capacitorC21 affording a forcing dwell control correction.The leading edge of the transducer pulse turns on transistor Q22 directly, but it turns on transistor Q24 via the turn off delays of overdriven transistors Q1 Q36 and Q23 Thus, the race condition is reliably won by transistor Q22 whenever the timer is pre empted.As mentioned above transistors Q18 and Ql9 form a complementary bistable mode control switch which when on enables timed turn on by means of transistor Qs. When the mode control switch is off, transistor Q5 conducts only during transducer pulses, giving direct coil control by the transducer signal.The arrangements described ensure that the mode control switch is not turned to off direct control when spurious sparks could result. Three separate means are provided for turning the mode control switch off and two of these, viz the timer outrangedt detector and the wtimer pre empted detector both have outputs which are effectively gated by the transducer pulse. The switch is turned on, if not already on, by the coil hold off pulse, and is turned off immediately afterwards if a more persistent output is received from the current limit duration detector.Mode change due to falling speed with negligible jitter is normally caused by timer outranged detection at, for example, about 700 rpm engine speed.Jitter induced hunting between modes is avoided since at speeds high enough for mode change to timer operation, the timed turn on is early enough to avoid being pre empted despite substantial jitter up to 6 with typical value of coil current growth time .For optimum dynamic performance in following engine acceleration, the magnitudes of the sink and source currents passed by transistors Q11 and Q12 are chosen in relation to the capacitor C2 and in relation to the time constants of the timer circuit to ensure that the dwell time error in any given cycle is approximately matched by the resultant timer delay correction in the next cycle at speeds at which transistors Q3, Q4 turn off. At high speeds the reduced coil off time can result in residual coil energy at coil turn on, causing random variations in the coil current growth time. Under these circumstances a reduced correction per cycle provides desirable smoothing of the response when transistors Q4 and Q3 remain on.If necessary, a voltage limiting protective zener diode feedback circuit of known kind may be associated with transistor 044.
