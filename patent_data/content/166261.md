# STATIC FIELD INDUCED SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES

## Abstract
There is disclosed a field effect transistor in which a charged body of material, formed with a fixed charge, is in field effect proximity to the channel region of the transistor. The channel region is formed of amorphous semiconductor mate rial, and the field effect of the charged body shifts the Fermi level of the channel region without atomic impurity doping. Ac cording to another aspect of the invention a semiconductor device is disclosed which includes a first region of amorphous semiconductor material, and a field inducing layer, formed with a built in charge, in field effect proximity to the first region so as to shift the Fermi level thereof. The device also includes a second region of material which has a different Fermi level than the material of the first region. The first and second regions are placed in contact to form a semiconductor junction device.
