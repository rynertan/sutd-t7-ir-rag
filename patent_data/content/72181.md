# A PULSE WIDTH MODULATOR

## Abstract
In a pulse width modulation amplifier comprising a pulse width encoder 2 followed by a filter 5 a problem arises when the average pulse duration changes substantially within the fil ter delay time. The risk of this is reduced by the present inven tion by a circuit 7 which has the effect of setting an upper limit to the rate of change or slew rate of the input signal.
