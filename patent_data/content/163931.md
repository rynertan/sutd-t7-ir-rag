# Ribbon cartridge motion control with a non concentric drive.

## Abstract
A cartridge 1 is attached to a carrier and tiltable around a tilting axis 2 . The carrier is movable along platen 3 and parallel to the print line and tilting axis 2 . On the rear and on the bottom of the cartridge a drive knob 4 is provided as part of the internal cartridge ribbon drive. On the carrier a ribbon feed device with wheel 6 and upright standing blades 7 is provided. Those blades 7 cooperate with walls inside the knob surface and form a kind of screw driver interconnection. Both engaging parts 7 and walls allow a movement perpendic ular to their rotational axis and to each other. Wheel 6 with blades 7 rotates around an axis and knob 4 rotates around an other axis. Intentionally the two rotational axis are offset to each other relative to tilting axis 2 . Thus, always a moment around this tilting axis 2 is created. To force cartridge 1 with knob 4 down onto ribbon feed wheel 6 is closer to tilting axis 2 than rotational axis of the cartridge ribbon drive.
