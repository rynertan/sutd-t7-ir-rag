# Fluid flow reverser assembly.

## Abstract
A reverser assembly includes a movable connector 14 which rotates about one end to couple with a selected one of two apertures in a pressure plate 6 . A resilient seal 19 fits around the end of the connector 14 and against one surface 6a of the plate 6 . The seal is inherently aided in its sealing action by high pressure fluid in the system controlled by the assembly and present inside the chamber 2 .
