# Composite surgical dressings.

## Abstract
A surgical dressing is disclosed which is composed of a polymeric film 13 having a moisture vapor transmission rate between 15 and 80 grams per 100 sq. inches per 24 hours. There is an adhesive 14 around the periphery on the lower surface of the film and a series of apertures 18 through the film. There is an absorbent pad 12 on the upper surface of the film secured in place by a fibrous covering material 10 . The fibrous covering material is adhesively coated and is of the same dimensions as the film so that it may be removed without lifting the film from the skin of the patient.
