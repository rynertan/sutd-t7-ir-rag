# System for storing and dispensing magnetic tape cartridges.

## Abstract
A system for storing and dispensing a magnetic tape cartridge having a pivotal storage cell 10 which includes a cartridge discharge end and a cartridge abutting end. A support 12 is located beneath the cell and pivot means 16 are located intermediate the ends of the cell to permit the cell to pivot on the support means relative to the horizontal. Means are provided to limit the amount of pivotal movement of the cell relative to the horizontal. The center of gravity of the cell is located closer to the cartridge abutting end than to the cartridge discharge end so that the cartridge abutting end of the cell normally occupies a lower position relative to the horizontal than the discharge end and a cartridge in the cell is inclined downwardly against the abutting end of the cell.
