# Dual output power supply.

## Abstract
A high voltage power supply that produces a relatively high current at a relatively low voltage P.C. output Eb and a relatively low current at a relatively high voltage D.C. output Ea is driven from a common transformer winding 22 . The low voltage is produced by a rectifier bridge 14 and the high voltage is produced by a full wave voltage doubler type circuit that includes rectifier elements CR2, CR4 of the bridge. However, the high voltage main storage capacitor C4 is isolated from low voltage currents and the low voltage main storage capacitor C1 is isolated from high voltage currents.
