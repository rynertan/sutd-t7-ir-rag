# A method of casting a recuperative type heat exchanger casing.

## Abstract
A method of casting a hollow bodied plate type recuperative heat exchanger envelope. The heat exchange envelope comprises first and second envelope halves 10, 24 cast independently, then bonded together by fusion of molten metal of the second envelope half 24 with solidified metal of the first envelope half 10 . The first envelope half 10 includes a lateral flange 14 on opposite sides thereof that is confronted by the molten metal of the second envelope half 24 to form a flange that connects envelope halves providing an increased area of contact therebe tween. The flange of the second envelope half 24 includes multiple surface areas that become fused to opposite sides of the first envelope half 10 to form a strong connection impervious to fluid leakage.
