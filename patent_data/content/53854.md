# High voltage semiconductor devices.

## Abstract
A field effect transistor, bipolar transistor, PIN diode, Schottky rectifier or other high voltage semiconductor device comprises a semiconductor body 1 throughout a portion 3 of which a depletion layer is formed in at least a high voltage mode of operation of the device, for example by reverse biasing a rectifying junction 5 . The known use of a single high resistivity body portion of one conductivity type both to carry the high voltage and to conduct current results in the series resistivity increasing approximately in proportion with the square of the breakdown voltage. This square law relationship is avoided by using in accordance with the invention a depleted body portion 3 which comprises an interleaved structure of first and second regions 11 and 12 of alternating conductivity types which carry the high voltage occurring across the depleted body portion 3 . The thickness and doping concentration of each of these first and second regions 11 and 12 are such that when depleted the space charge per unit area formed in each is balanced at least to the extent that an electric field resulting from any imbalance is less than the critical field strength at which avalanche breakdown would occur in the body portion 3 . At least the first regions 11 in at least one mode of operation of the device provide electrically parallel current paths extending through the body portion 3 .
