A cleansing foam for teeth in aerosol form, charac terized by a content of the following components a an aerating gas and b a liquid composition comprising an alcohol component, a pharmaceutically acceptable sur factant, a pharmaceutically acceptable humectant,a pharmaceutically acceptable effective anti plaue, bacteriostatic agent, and water.

## Description
The invention relates to a cleansing foam for teeth in aerosol form. Cleansers for natural or artificial teeth have con ventionally been available in the form of liquids, powders, pastes or effervescent tablets. A substantially complete removal of plaque or tobacco film with a known cleansing means is either not obtain able or requires extensive brushing and or a consider able period of soaking of the dentures. Furthermore, none of the known cleansing means provides an effective activity against The US PS 45 11 486 discloses a method of cleaning dentures using aerated foams. Although it seems to realise a rapid and effective cleansing, there is no specific improvement in the anti plaque and or lasting bacteriostatic acticity. It is known from a number of publications in various journals Holbeche, J. D., Rulijancich, M. K., Read, P. C., Austral. Dent. J. Furthermore, all the above applications relates to the use of mouthwash containing cetyl pyridinium chloride. No anti plaque activity is found when cetyl pyridinium chloride is used in lozenges Barnes, G. P., Radentz, W. H., Perkins, B. E., J. Prev. Dents. Thus, the problem of the invention is to provide a cleansing foam for teeth effecting a lasting bacterio static and effective anti plaque activity without ex tensive brushing and or a considerable period of soak ing of the dentures, in case of using the cleansing foam in its most preferable form, namely for artificial teeth. According to the invention this problem is solved by a cleansing foam of the abovementioned kind which is characterized by a content of the following components a an aerating gas and b a liquid composition compris ing an alcohol component, a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant, a pharmaceutically acceptable humectant, a pharmaceutically acceptable effective anti plaque, bacteriostatic agent, and water. Preferred embodiments of the cleansing foam are subject of the respective subclaims. The invention further relates to the methods of using the cleansing foam as cleansing means for artificial teeth, i.e. dentures, or as cleansing means for natural teeth, i.e. in the kind of a tooth paste. The cleansing foam according to the invention provides an excellent tobacco film removal of 85 with a three minute soak or 83 with brushing of dentures. The removal of simulated agressive food stain mordanted onto There is found a reduction from 10⁸ to 10⁴ of Furthermore it is effective against The cleansing foam for teeth according to the invention does not cause any chemical attack or any damage by brushing with it on fine, highly polished acrylic sur faces or on surfaces of natural teeth. Surprisingly there has been found a very high plaque inhibiting efficacy when using the cleansing foam according to the invention 75 inhibition, by weight, of the growth of a All these advantageous effects can be achieved by 0.55 to 0.70 percent by weight of cetyl pyridinium chloride in the above mentioned liquid composition. The presence of a surfactant in this liquidcomposition acts to generate the foam and permits penetration of the foam cleanser into the cracks and crevices of the teeth, thereby assisting in the removal of stains, debris and food particles from exposed surfaces. Al though several commercially available surfactants can be used, a mixture of a non ionic type and an amphote ric type detergent is preferred in the present inven tion whereby the non ionic type detergent provides the initial rich foaming characteristic to the product while the amphoteric type detergent provides the second foaming generated during the brushing cycle. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the inven tion, the surfactant is a mixture of 6.5 10.0 percent by weight of the non ionic type detergent and 4.5 8.0 percent by weight of the amphoteric type detergent. The employed detergents are cetyl stearyl alcohol ethoxy late 20 moles ethylene oxide as a non ionic type detergent and the disodium salt of an dicarboxylic coconut imidazoline derivative as an amphoteric type detergent. The alcohol component of the said liquid composition, namely ethanol, has several useful purposes. Firstly, ethanol acts together with cetyl pyridinium chloride to provide an effective anti microbial action. Secondly, the alcohol component solubilizes the flavouring oils and other adjuvants that may not be water soluble. Thirdly, the alcohol component acts together with a flavouring adjuvant to impart a pleasant fresh taste to the cleansed teeth. The ethanol employed in the present invention ranges from 28 32 percent by volume of the said liquid composition. The presence of a humectant helps to stabilize the foam. A typical water soluble pharmaceutically accept able humectant, suitable for use in the said liquid composition is glycerol in an amount of 0.5 4.0 percent by weight. Since the cleansing foam for teeth according to the invention is to be stored finally in a metalic can, it is useful to add a corrosion inhibitor to the liquid composition. Sodium nitrate or sodium benzoate, single or in combination, is suitable for this purpose when used in an amount from 0 1.0 percent by weight, preferably less than 0.25 percent by weight, in the case of sodium nitrate or in an amount from 0 2.0 percent by weight, preferably less than 0.5 percent by weight, in the case of sodium benzoate. Any colouring and flavouring adjuvants used in cleans ing powders or tooth pastes are also suitable herein. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention a mixture of FD C Yellow No. 5 in an amount from 0 0.002 percent by weight and FD C Green No. 3 in an amount from 0 0.0002 percent by weight is selected as colouring adjuvant. A combination of several essential oils is selected to give the product a pleasant very characteristic aroma tic odor when used in an amount from 1.0 2.0 percent by weight, preferably 1.4 1.9 percent by weight, most preferably 1.80 percent by weight. This special for mulation is shown in the following table whereby the specifications are given in percent by weight of the liquid compositon relating to the most preferably amount of the flavouring adjuvant In order to assure a constantly high quality of the product the liquid composition is filled up to 100 percent by weight with demineralized water and the pH value is adjusted to a range from 6.5 7.5 with nitric acid 20 . Since the cleansing foam for teeth accord ing to the invention has an excellent cleansing effect, a specific anti plaque, bacteriostatic activity, a pleasant and fresh colour and flavour and since it is not toxic or agressive, it can be used as cleansing means for artificial as well as for natural teeth. Further features and advantages of the invention can be gathered from the following description of a perfor mance example. To the alcohol 288 ml add the cetyl stearyl alcohol ethoxylate 70 g disodium dicarboxylic coconut imi dazoline 50 g and the flavour blend 18 g mix un til the detergents are dispersed. Add water to approx. half of the final volume and mix until the mixture be comes clear. Add glycerol 10 g , add cetyl pyridinium chloride 6 g and mix until dissolved. Into a separate vessel mix the colours FD C Green No. 3 0.0015 g , FD C Yellow No. 5 0.015 g , sodium nitrate 5 g and sodium benzoate 10 g , add a small amount of water 100 ml and mix until dissolved. Add to the main mixture and mix until totally dissolved. Add water to 90 of final volume 900 ml , adjust pH of mixture to 7.00 using a 10 nitric acid solution. Make up to 1 litre with water, mix and store.
