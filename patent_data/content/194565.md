## Description
MACHINE FOR MELTING THE SNOW.The present invention relates to a machine for melting the now, particularly suitable for melting the snow accumulated on the roads.More particularly, the present invention relates to a machine for melting the snow and for collecting up or dispersing the obtained water, optionally mixed with an anty freezing agent.As known, for clearing the roads from the snow are generally used heavy vehicles, such as lorries, tractors and bulldozers, provided, at the front part, with blades, wedges, and whirls.These snow ploughs are particularly efficient for clearing roads and motorways where the space is sufficiently wide to permit the accumulation of the snow along the edges of roads or motorways without causing danger or creating difficult situations while, they are not particularly efficient and most unsuitable for clearing the roads in the urban centre.The main reason of this ineffectiveness is that the storing of the snow in the edges of the cleared roads is often cause of many drawbacks, such as, for example, the complete obstruction of footpaths, driveways, carparks, bus service stops and s.paces reserved to the loading and unloading of public or private materials. For resolving these drawbacks it is necessary a manual work with the shovels to open passages sufficiently wide for the pedestrian crossing. Another drawback is the moving of cars, which, previous along the cases of the roads, are trapped in by the accumulated snow. According to the present invention, the above reported drawbacks are overcome by a machine comprising heating means and means supporting said heating means and contacting the same with the snow to be melted.The machine may be any known lorry, tractor or bulldozer which may be provided with a collecting tank and unloading pipe. The heating means are preferably nozzle burners. The means supporting the heating means and contacting said heating means with the snow may be a chamber provided with heating means and wherein the snow is admitted pannels supporting the heating means and moved in sliding contact with the ground to be cleared metallic rollers inside heated by the heating means a a hopper or feedbox provided with burners etc. By the machine of the present invention the following results may be obtained the snow removed from the roads is collected or directly melted the water produced is collected in tanks or unloaded directly onto the ground along the vehicles pathway, optionally mixed with an anty freezing substance as the machine moves along, it generates passageways in the snow perfectly clean, without making the situation worse in any way, meaning that, it will clean directly without leaving residues along the edges of the roads.The advantages obtained by the machine of the present invention consist essentially in that no accumulation or whatever obstruction of snow is formed in the borders of the cleared roads the snow immediatly melted in water, reducing the volume and easying the evacuation problems, which may be by the direct unloading into the sewers through manholes, by collecting the water into tanks, basins or canals, or by the direct disperse of the water onto the ground, preferably mixed with an anty freezing substance.In order to better understand the main feature of the machine of the present invention, the same will be reinafter described with reference to the figures which illustrate some preferred, exemplified and not limiting embodiments of the present machine and wherein fig. 1 represents a longitudinal cross section view of a first embodiment of the machine of the present invention fig. 2 represents a side schematic view of the machine of figure 1 fig. 3 represents a side schematic view of a second embodiment of the machine of the present invention fig.4 represent.s.a side schematic view of a third embodiment of the machine of the present invention fig.5 represents a side schematic view of another embodiment of the machine of the present invention, and fig. 6 represents a side schematic view of a further possible embodiment of the machine of the present invention.With reference to figures 1 and 2, the machine for melting the snow essentially comprises a self propelled vehicle 1 , provided with an engine 2 and a driver s cabin 3 . The machine, schematically illustrated in the figures, may have the structural and operative characteristics of the well known snow ploughs or heavy vehicles used for the movement of the grounds. It can, therefore, be provided with two or four wheel traction 4 it can be anteriorly or posteriorly steered or else on the two axis it can have two or more axis it can be provided with wheels of the equal or different diameter and or with pneumatics particularly adapt for its movement on the snow.According to the present embodiment, the machine is provided, at the front part, with a multiple shovel roller 5 , arranged in transversal way and pared up with a collecting and conveyor tin 6 . The roller 5 is vertically regulable by a pneumatic piston and rotated by means of the same vehicle engine or byan independent engine.The collecting and conveyor tin 6 i s articulated to a mouth 7 of a melting chamber 8 Chamber 8 is arranged at the bottom of the vehicle 1 and extends along all the width and height of the vehicle including the axis of the wheels 4 . The chamber 8 is formed by a front enclined inferior wall 9 terminating in a transversal loading tank 10 , by a top wall 11 provided with a plurality of burners . 12 , downwardly extending, and by an end wall 9 .The combustible is stored in a tank 15 and fed to burners 12 through conductors 13 regulating station 14 . When the vehicle 1 is moved along road to clean, the roller 5 collects the snow and pushes it into the transversal mouth 7 .The snow slides along the enclined inferior wall 9 wherein the flames of the burners 12 melt the snow.As the snow liquifyies, the derivating water is collected into tank 10 and fed to ttse collecting tank 19 through a suction pipe 16 , a pump 17 and a discharge duct 18 . The suction pipe 16 draws in the lower part of the tank 10 and may be provided with a filter. The collecting tank 19 is provided with an unloading pipe 20 .When the tank 19 is full, the water obtained from the melting of the snow, can be unloaded into sewers through man holes which are found along the roads or else it can be unloaded in other fit places.The avancement of the vehicle 1. creates paths free from snow, wide as the multiple shovel roller 5 , without causing obstructions by heaps of snow on the edges of the roads.The vehicle illustrated in fig. 3 is substantially identical to the vehicle of fig. 1, apart from the terminal part wherein the unloading duct 20 of the collecting tank 19 is connected, through a regulable mixer 21 , to the unloading duct 22 of another tank 23 ,containing an anti freezing agent. From the mixer 21 , the mixture anti freezing agent and water is fed to a distributor 24 provided with a possible mixing fan and discharge spraying pipes 25 . In this way, the water deriving from the melting of the snow, mixed with anti freezing agent, is redistributed from the back of the vehicle onto the path cleared from the snow. The anti freezing agent prevents that ice will be formed on the cleared path, and, further, facilitates the melding of the remaining small layer of snow, as the convoyer tin 5 cannot be slided into contact with the ground. Figure 4 illustrates a machine 1 for melting the snow particularly suitable for the application on the existing vehicles. It essentially comprises a metallic pannel 26 , which is hinged at 27 in the front part of the vehicle The pannel 26 is vertically regulable by means of idraulic or pneumatic pistons 28 . The pannel 26 is provided with a plurality of burners 12 , turned to the ground and applied by the fuel through flexible ducts 13 , pumping and regulating station 14 and tank 15 . When the burners 12 are lit and the flames put ,near the layer of snow, this latter melts. In this way the vehicle 1 moving forward, forms a passage by dissolving the meeting snow. The figure represents a vehicle particularly suitable for a melting snow device it is however, obvious that the above mo.vable pannel.. 26 can be applied to the front part of any vehicle, such as, for example, lorries, tractors, bulldozers and similar heavy vehicles capable to carry also a combustible tank which is needed for the burners and a station for moving idraulic pistons 28 . Pannel 26 and the idraulic pistons 28 may be mounted onto a plate or a vertical structure 29 , which is indipendent from the vehicle, and may be applied to the front part thereof. For a better position of pannel 26 relative, to ground, it may be provided with n anterior guide roller 30 and or side small wheels 31 . In the presence of big layers of snow to melt,.the pannel 26 is preferably in a more or less inclined position, so that its back part adheres, as more as possible, to the ground while the front part is substantially at the same level of the snow layer, Figure 5 illustrates another alternative embodiment of the present machine. The structure of this machine is substantially the same of that of a known stone crasher, except that rollers 32 and 33 are hollow inside and have the outside surface in metallic plate. The burners 12 are applied in radial directions on the central axis 34 and are fed by the fuel, stored in tank 15 through flexible ducts 13 , and power station 14 .The burners 12 overheat from the inside the surface of the rollers 32 and 33 , which, by moving forward, melt the flattened snow.The action of the two sequential rollers 32 and 33 guarantee the complete dissolution of the snow.The machine may be provided with anterior shovel roller 35 which helps the movement and the distribution of the snow onto the anterior roller 32 . Similar solution can be forseen with only one roller.The above described machine may be obtained by substituting the rollers of the known stone crasher vehicles, which may assume a double functions according to the requests. The embodiment of the present machine illustrated in fig. 6, represents a machine for the dissolution of the snow in which the snow is sollected by a known anterior mechanical shovel 36 and unloaded into a superior drainage hopper 37 around which the burnersare d isposed. The fuel is fed to the burners from the tank 15 through ducts 13 .The obtained water is collected in the below tank 19 , having the same structure of that described for the embodiments of figures 1, 2 or 3.The embodiments of the present machine shown in figures 4 and 5 provided with snow melting means and wherein the obtained water is released on the route, may be provided, if it is the case, with supplemental tanks 38 for an anti freezing agent and with a discarge sprinkler 39 .
