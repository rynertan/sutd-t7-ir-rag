# Apparatus for the processing of an information stream with the aid of an error correcting convolutional code and for the detection of an error still irremediable in this processing.

## Abstract
A sequence of k tuples of information elements is converted by means of an error correcting convolutional code into a sequence of n tuples n greater than k of code elements. In the processing of the code elements use is made first of a syndrome former 226 to form a sequence of n k tuples of syndrome elements from then received sequence of n tuples of code elements. From a segment of a number of successive n k tuples of syndrome elements one or more correction bits f‚ÇÅ are formed in each case so as to be able to correct the received code bits and also, if a correction is applied, to be able to update a number of further syndrome bits from that same segment. Furthermore an n k tuple of secondary syndrome bits or a residue bits is formed at 252 in each case from this updated segment. A first value of such an n k tuple indicates the state in which the decoder must be provisionally considered as having corrected all errors in a predetermined sequence of n tuples of code elements. All other values indicate that certainly an error has remained uncorrected. Such an other value is converted into an unreliability signal. The unreliability signal indicates a subsequence of n tuples of code elements, in which the errors not to be corrected are located. Outside this subsequence the n tuples can be reliable again.
