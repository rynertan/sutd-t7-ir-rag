# Synthesis of 2 keto 1,4 diazacycloalkanes.

## Abstract
Synthesis have been discovered for the preparation of 2 keto 1,4 diazacycloalkanes and their derivatives. A. A synthesis wherein a cis 3,3 dialkyl 3,4 dihydro quinoxalin 2 one is hydrogenated in the presence of a suitable hydrogenation catalyst, at elevated temperature and pressure, to yield a cis 3,3 dialkyl decahydroquinoxa lin 2 one. B. A synthesis wherein trans 1,2 diamino cyclohexa ne is reacted with acetone cyanohydrin in the presence of water to yield trans 3,3 dimethyl decahydroquinoxalin 2 one. C. A synthesis wherein a cyclic or acyclic 1,2 dia mine is reacted with cyclic or acyclic cyanohydrins in the presence of aqueous NaOH and in the presence of an anium salt catalyst in conjunction with a haloform to yield a polysubstituted 2 keto 1,4 diazacycloalkane. D. A synthesis wherein a preselected 1,2 diamine is reacted with a saturated acyclic or cyclic monoketone, and a haloform in the presence of i an onium salt catalyst ii , an organic solvent, and iii aqueous alkali. Transisomers of polysubstituted quinoxalin 2 ones may now be prepared.
