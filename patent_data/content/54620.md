# Data processing terminal.

## Abstract
An intelligent data processing terminal wherein the function controlling information of a program is separated from portions of the sequence of execution controlling information and each are stored in the form of tables. The function controlling information takes the form of a table 65 including a plurality of function specifying entries. The function execution sequence controlling information takes the form of a table of pointers 63 . Function controlling entries, each having a plurality of fields for defining, modifying, and specifying the functions and related data to be executed, need not be repetitively duplicated throughout the program. Instead, the shorter pointers to the function table entries can be provided in the sequence table in the sequence in which the functions are to be executed.
