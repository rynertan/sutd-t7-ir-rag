# Combined endoscope and ultrasonic diagnostic device.

## Abstract
A combined endoscope and ultrasonic diagnostic device for the examination of a body, an ultrasonic probe tip 23 being mounted in an insertion sheath 21 to transmit and receive ultrasonic waves for the diagnostic investigation of internal organs and an endoscope 27 being provided to observe the body cavity interior. In previous such combined diagnosing devices a driving means is required to drive an ultrasonic oscillator or scanning mirror provided within the probe tip, and the provision of a driving shaft together with signal wiring and a light guide connected to a light source means to transmit an illuminating light to the endoscope results in a cumbersome unit difficult to employ in diagnostic operations within a body cavity. Contact with an internal organ that is to be studied may also be obstructed, depending on the arranging positions and methods. There fore, the proposed device has a small and light hand grip 29 provided with flexible couplings 33, 38 arranged and positioned so as not to obstruct operation, and thus improve operatability.
