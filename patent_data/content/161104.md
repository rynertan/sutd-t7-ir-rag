# POLYMER EMULSIONS AND PROCESS OF PREPARING POLYMER EMULSIONS

## Abstract
A polymer emulsion is obtained by a process of homo polymerizing specific N alkyl or N alkylene substituted meth acrylamides, copolymerizing two or more of the said meth acrylamides, or copolymerizing at least one of the said meth acrylamides with one or more other copolymerizable monomers. The emulsion particles have temperature de pendent hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity, and can for ex ample be comprised of a hydrophobic core with a surface coating of the thermosensitive N alkyl or N alkylene sub stituted meth acrylamides.
