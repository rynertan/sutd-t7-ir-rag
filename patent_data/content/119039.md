# TOKEN ACCESS CONTROLLER PROTOCOL AND ARCHITECTURE

## Abstract
Disclosed is a token access protocol for a local area network and the architecture for a token access controller to implement this protocol. The protocol provides for network initialization, recovery and addition of nodes to the network. The host of each node has a minimal involvement with maintaining the network and the protocol does not require the host processor to format frames for transmission. Data reception or transmission is facilitated through the use of a Direct Memory Access DMA so the host processor is freed to perform other tasks while data is being transmitted or received.
