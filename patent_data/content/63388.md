## Description
PROCESS FOR MARKING UNDERWATER PARTS OF MARINE STRUCTURES The invention relates to a method for marking underwater parts of a marine structure and to marine structures thus marked. Identification of individual areas of underwater parts of marine structures, such as ships, buoys, fuel tanks, floating and fixed offshore platforms, pipelines, often gives rise to problems. Colour codes and or painted numbers or other signs are unsuitable in most cases, because due to fouling by organisms such as grasses, algae, barnacles, tube worms, serpula, oysters, ascidia, bryozoa and the like, the said codes, numbers and signs are no longer identifiable after a relatively short period of time. For that reason it is often difficult, e.g. for divers, to locate certain parts and areas of underwater structures which is often necessary for maintenance and repair. There has now been found a method for marking underwater parts of marine structures which yields marks which can be easily detected and identified, which are not prone to rapid fouling, and accordingly remain identifiable for long periods of time. According to the invention there is provided a method for marking underwater parts of a marine structure, which is characterized in that a coating which comprises a vulcanized silicone rubber and a fluorescent pigment is applied locally onto the outer surface of the structure. Vulcanized silicone rubbers can be prepared from silicone gums, which are highly linear high molecular weight organosiloxane polymers consisting essentially of alternating atoms of silicon and oxygen as a polymeric backbone with organic substituents attached to the silicon atoms of the polymeric backbone. Vulcanized silicone rubber may be prepared by heat curing with various catalysts such as peroxides or by radiation curing of a silicone gum which, e.g., substantially consists of a polydisubstituted siloxane. All or the predominant part of the organic substituents may be methyl units, the remainder being vinyl and or phenyl units. Vulcanized silicone rubbers may also be prepared by vulcanizing at ambient temperature silicone gums which contain silanol end groups the so called RTV gums . All or the predominant part of the substituents in the RTV gums may be hydrocarbyl groups in particular methyl groups , the remainder may be ethyl , phenyl or substituted hydrocarbyl groups, such as chlorophenyl , fluoropropyl or cyanoethyl groups. RTV gums in which the organic substituents contain or consist of silicon free segments which are constituted of recurrent units in particular polymeric segments as described in European PatentPublication or32597 are also very suitable to be vulcanized to silicone rubbers. The polymeric segments are preferably linked to the silicon atoms via alkylene or akylidene groups, and very suitably are derived from monomers containing ethylenic unsaturation. The said monomers may, e.g., cons st of unsaturated acids or derivates thereof such as ester, e.g. esters of acrylic and or methacrylic acid and or comprise styrene. Folneric segments based on copolymers of styrene and butylacrylate are very suitable. The preparation of vuScar.izel silicone rubbers from silicone gums at ambient temperatures may be carried out by two different methods, viz. the one pack RTV system and the two pack RTV system as described in the british Patent Specification 1,581,727. In order to lengthen the period in which the coating according to the invention is not fouled, it is of advantage that the coating also comprises a fluid organic compound which is liquid at the temperature prevailing in sea water and preferably is metal free. xudation of such a fluid organic compound from the silicone rubber is of advantage. Preferably such a fluid organic compound has a boiling point of at least 250 0C at atmospheric pressure, in order to avoid that it is evaporated or exuded at too high a rate from the coating. Very suitable fluid organic compounds are silicone fluids, which consist of poly dihydrocarbyl siloxanes of which the hydrocarbyl groups may be substituted with hetero atoms . The hydrocarbyl groups may be alkyl groups in particular methyl groups or all or part thereof may be aryl groups in particular phenyl groups . Silicone fluids of which the hydrocarbyl groups consist partly of methyl groups and partly of phenyl groups have been found to be in particular suitable. An other type of very suitable fluid organic compounds consists of low molecular weight polyolefins, such as ethylene propylene copolymers, and in particular polyisobutene with a molecular weight up to about 5,000, e.g., from 300 500. Other types of fluid organic compounds which are suitable are low molecular weight polydienes, polyesters, polyisocyanates, polyurethanes, polyepoxides, lubricating oils, such as technical white oils, and plasticizers e.g., esters of fatty acids, which may be substituted with hetero atoms or groups, esters of phosphoric acid, halogenated hydrocarbons . In case the fluid organic confound is not sufficiently compatible with the silicone rubber to ensure a very long period of anti fouling activity, the fluid organic compound is very suitably incorporated in the silicone rubber in an encapsulated form, e.g. as described in 3ritish Patent Specification 1,581,727. The amount of the fluid organic compound present may vary between wide limits. Amounts from 0.1 to 100 pbw on 100 pbw of vulcanized silicone rubber are very suitable. Fluorescent compounds are inorganic or organic compounds in particular dyes which convert onfalling light of a certain wave length the exciting light to light of a longer wave length which is emitted after a short period of time e.g., less than 10 2 sec. . In general, the exciting light consists of ultraviolet light or visible light of the blue end of the spectrum, and the light emitted has wave lengths in the visible part of the spectrum. In the preferred cases the emitted light has the same hue as light reflected by the dye, because the reflected colour is thus reinforced with the emitted colour producing hues which appear extraordinarily bright to the eye. This effect is achieved by incorporating a suitable organic dye in the fluorescent pigment which is to be used according to the invention. It is of advantage that the dye incorporated fluoresces under the influence of exciting light in the visible part of the spectrum in other words shows daylight fluorescence because in that case by irradiation with electric torch light as used during working under water e.g. by divers , the marked areas of the surface of the marine structures are clearly visible and identifiable. Very suitably the pigments consist for the greater part of organic resins in which the dyes have been incorporated, in general in low concentrations e.g., 1 5 w . Such pigments are commercially available. The choice of the pigment to be used will depend on the type of colour and itensity thereof which is desired under the prevailing circumstances at the underwater parts of the marine structure. The amount of fluoresecent pigments present in the coatings according to the invention may vary between wide limits. Amounts from 0.1 to 20sow, on vilcanized silicone rubber are very suitable. Although the va canized silicone rubber may be applied as such if desires in acizixture with the fluorescent pigment onto the outer surface of the marine structure, it is preferred to treat the said surface with a mixture which comprises the silicone gum to be vulcanized, the fluorescent pigment and other components if any , and to vulcanize the silicone gum in situ. The coating or the mixture from which the coating is to be formed in situ can be applied onto the marine structure by any suitable means, such as brushing, spraying and the like. If desired, materials which enhance the strength of the silicone rubber may also be incorporated. As examples may be mentioned fibrous materials e.g., glass fibres, glass flakes or nylon fibres and powdered polymers, such as polytetrafluorethylene. It will be understood that the marking according to the invention need not be carried out under water. It is preferred to mark the underwater parts of the marine structures before these structures are put into the water. In order to protect other parts of the marine structure against fouling than those to be marked, it is of course possible to apply a suitable coating onto the said parts which may, e.g., comprise the same components as those according to the invention except the fluorescent pigment. The surface to be coated according to the invention may have been pretreated in order to increase the adhesion of the coating according to the invention thereto, e.g., by sand blasting and or application of an adhesive layer. Other coatings may also have been applied, e.g., an anti corrosive coating and or an anti fouling coating of prior art.The coatings according to tbe invention may also comprise metalcontaining anti fouling a e.lts of prior art. It is also possible to apply the coating according to the invention onto the outer surface of the marine structure by application onto the said outer surface of a flexible sheet the outermost layer of which comprises a vulcanized silicone rubber and a fluorescent pigment. The flexible sheet very suitably consists of a fabric, which may for example be a woven fabric of e.g. glass, polypropylene, nylon or polyester yarn, which woven fabric may have been impregnated with a vulcanized silicone rubber, or of a tough plastics film of e.g. oriented polyester or polypropylene film. The coated flexible sheet is very conveniently secured to the marine structure by wrapping around an underwater surface thereof and securing by any convenient means, e.g. by clamps and or clamping bands razor frames.The coating according to the invention may also be applied onto non flexible sheets, such as glass or metal sheets, which are very suitably secured to the marine structures by any convenient means as described above. They may also be self clamping. The invention also relates to marine structures which have been marked by the method according to the invention. The invention also relates to mixtures which, when applied onto a surface, can form a coating layer by vulcanization, which mixtures comprise a silicone gum and a fluorescent pigment, and to sheets which contain such a vulcanized layer onto their surface.
