# Coal gasifying burner.

## Abstract
A coal gasifying burner has a rotating grill comprising two grill cylinders 9 spaced from each other by a narrow gap 11 . Each grill cylinder mainly consists of a shaft on which a plurality of discs 10 is mounted. The grill cylinders rotate very slowly inwards when viewed from the top. Side walls 6 made of metal sheet are sloped in compliance with the coal flow from a coal storage 1 to a combustion cell 2 . A cylinder 15 surrounding the burner nozzle introduces the combustion air. The excessive coal located on the sloping side walls in the vicinity of the combustion of coal is gasified and the gases generated thereby are burnt outside of the burner with secondary air which has been introduced into the coal gasifying burner for cooling it and has thereby been heated itself.
