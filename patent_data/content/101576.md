# Process for producing thermoplastic resin.

## Abstract
A process for producing a thermoplastic resin capable of giving a molded article having a very good appearance, by coagulating a thermoplastic resin latex prepared by an emulsion polymerization method which comprises making the latex into a coagulated slurry by carrying out the co agulation procedure in a range of temperatures lower than the solidifying point of the thermoplastic resin, adding an alkaline substance to said coagulated slurry in a range of temperatures lower than the aforesaid solidifying point so that the pH of said coagulated slurry is adjusted to a pH 0.1 or more higher than its pH at the time of the coagulation and that the pH of the whole coagulated slurry after the addition of the alkaline substance is adjusted to 7.0 or lower, and then raising the temperature of said coagulated slurry to solidify the coagulated particies.
