# A METHOD OF MANUFACTURING DOORS FOR DOMESTIC OVENS COMBINING MICROWAVE AND ELECTRICAL RESISTANCE HEATING

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing doors for domestic ovens combining microwave and electrical resistance heating. An inner backing door 5 comprising an outer side wall 6 hav ing a plurality of transversal slots 7 , a stiffening frame 11 , and an outer backing door 16 comprising a supporting side wall 26 are pressed from sheet steel. A flat metal sheet is punched and pressed to form a perforated microwave shield 14 . The stiffening frame 11 is welded to the inner backing door 5 to form a sub assembly. The sub assembly 5, 11 and the outer backing door 16 are selectively enamelled so that each comprises a zone 12, 17 free from enamel, and are heated to a temperature exceeding 700 C. A gasket 13 , a first glass pane 12A and the shield 14 are placed on the sub assembly 5, 11 to which the outer door 16 is fastened so that the shield 14 is clamped between the non enamelled zones 12, 17 . A second glass pane 28 is placed on the outer backing door 16 and fastened to the supporting side wall 26 .
