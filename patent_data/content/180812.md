## Description
This invention relates to novel compounds of the following formula wherein R₁ is formyl, hydroxymethyl, aminomethyl, the group hydrogen, halogen, COOH, and alkyl C₁ C₃ , R₂ and R₃ may be the same or different and are piperidinyl, N alkyl C₁ c₅ ₂, pyrrolidino, morpholino, or the groups with the provisos that where R₁ is aminomethyl or and where R1 is hydrogen, R2 and R3 may be the same or different and are piperidinyl, piperidinyl N oxide, N C₂H₅ ₂ or with the proviso that at least one of R₂ and R₃ must be in the N oxide form and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Preferred embodiments of the invention are as defined in Claims 2 to 6. Further embraced by the invention is a process for the preparation of the novel compounds as defined in Claims 7 to 11. The compounds of the present invention can be used in a method of treating the immune response system in a warm blooded animal which comprises administering to said animal an effective amount of a compound selected from those of the above formulas in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant or diluent. The use of immunomodulants and chemotherapeutic adjuvants constitutes a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of immune deficiencies and cancer and is based on the concept that there are distinctive antigens in or on most tumor cells embryonal or transplantation antigens that distinguish them from normal host cells. A majority of tumor immunologists favor the view that potentially malignant cells constantly arise but, because of their foreigness , are normally eliminated by a competent humoral and cellular immune system. occasionally, however, tumor cells escape this immune surveillance and continue to reproduce and cancer results. The reason for the failure of the normally efficient immune surveillance mechanisms is not fully understood but it is thought that the immune system becomes less effective with increasing age. It is depressed in certain genetic immuno deficiency diseases, in various bacterial, fungal or viral infections and in patients undergoing immuno suppressive therapy. The growth of the neoplasm itself, as well as the various therapeutic modalities designed to treat the disease, e.g., cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation, leads to a still greater depression of host resistance and results in an increased susceptibility to both exogenous and endogenous infections and perhaps accounts for the re initiation of tumor growth and metastasis which frequently follows treatment induced tumor remission. If depression of the immune system can result in the growth of malignancies, regulation of any facet of the immune response may help the host to eliminate residual. cancer cells. Therefore, it is desirable to search for chemical agents i.e., immunoregulants capable of restoring and stimulating host immune defense mechanisms in order to overcome the deficiencies which account for susceptibility to disease and failure to eradicate the cancer. Such immunoregulating agents would likely be incapable of arresting the growth of a large tumor but their clinical utility would derive from their capacity to enhance normal immune surveillance mechanisms in patients whose tumor burden has been reduced by surgical, radiotherapeutic or chemotherapeutic methods. Experimental studies in animals have demonstrated the antitumor potential of a number of immunoregulants including live organisms of bacillus Calmette Guerin BCG , heat killed cells of Modern research is directed to the discovery of a drug similar to, but more potent than, known immunoregulants such as levamisole that would be effective in the eradication of tumor cells when used in conjunction with standard therapeutic measures. Stimulators of host resistance may be detected in animal models that can, in fact, detect both immunostimulators and anticancer agents. Mice are put in a condition simulating immunodepression common to cancer patients. This is accomplished by infecting mice with a leukemia virus which produces both leukemia and a disease related immunodepression. Effective drugs are recognized by their ability to restore or enhance the antibody response in the experimental mice, or to inhibit tumor progression. Certain synthetic and naturally derived compounds have the ability to induce high levels of circulating interferon. Among these are bacterial endotoxins, intact bacteria and viruses, transplantable tumor cells and a variety of high and low molecular weight synthetic compounds such as poly I C, tilorone and pyran copolymer W. E. Stewart, The Interferon System, Springer Verlag, Wien, New York 1979 . Interferon has a major regulatory function in modulating cellular and humoral immune responses. Interferon, and inducers of interferon, activate macrophages to destroy tumor and virus infected cells, stimulate populations of immune cells to secrete lymphokines, protect against lethal infection by viruses and some bacterial species and stimulate the level of natural killer lymphocyte NK cell activity in animals Herberman, R. B. and Holden, H. T., Natural Cell Mediated Immunity, Adv. Cancer Res., The compounds of this invention may be prepared in accordance with the following flowcharts and descriptions. In accordance with Flowchart A, a 3,6 bis substituted acridine 1 , where R₂ and R₃ are as described above, in concentrated sulfuric acid is reacted with paraformaldehyde 2 , where x is an integer greater than 1, for about 1 2 to about one hour then precipitated in ether, giving 3 , where R₁ is CH₂OH. The resulting solid is dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, triethylamine is added and the mixture reacted with sulfur trioxide pyridine complex for about 1 to about 4 hours giving 4 where R₂ and R₃ are as described above and R₁ is formyl. In accordance with Flowchart B, a 3,6 bis substituted acridine 5 , where R₂ and R₃ are as described above, is dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid and reacted with hydroxymethyl phthalimide 6 for about 12 to about 24 hours to give 7 which is then reacted with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol at reflux for about 2 to about 4 hours giving 8 , where R₂ and R₃ are as described above and R₁ is aminomethyl. In accordance with the above flowchart, a 3,6 bis 2 chloroethoxy acridine 9 , where R₁ is as described hereinabove, is reacted with piperidine in a steel bomb at about 60 to about 100 C for about 18 to about 36 hours, giving a 3,6 bis 2 piperidinoethoxy acridine 11 which is then dissolved in methanol, treated with excess 30 hydrogen peroxide for about 12 to about 48 hours, then with platinum catalyst to destroy the excess peroxide and is purified by dry column chromatography on silica gel using the developing system methanol triethylamine 20 1, v v . The length of reaction time with hydrogen peroxide is the determining factor in whether a mono oxide 12 or dioxide 13 is produced. Further, compounds of the formula where R₁ is as described hereinabove and R₂ and R₃ are selected from the group consisting of N alkyl C₁ C₄ ₂ are dissolved in methanol, treated with excess 30 hydrogen peroxide for about 12 to about 48 hours, treated with ether and purified by recrystallization twice from acetonitrile. The length of reaction time with hydrogen peroxide is the determining factor in whether a mono oxide or dioxide is produced. The compounds of the present invention have been examined in a variety of murine model systems designed to evaluate their ability to restore or enhance cellular and humoral immune responses. In the Rauscher virus model, the ability to produce antibodies to a complex antigen sheep red blood cells is severely depressed. The compounds of this invention partially restore functioning of this complex immune system and stimulate antibody production to more normal levels. The active compounds and novel compositions of the present invention are active as immune modulators when tested according to the following procedures Injection of B ALB c mice with Rauscher leukemia virus RLV is characterized by 1 a rapidly developing viremia, 2 suppression of the primary antibody response to antigens administered a few days after virus infection, 3 a progressive enlargement of the spleen splenomegaly , and 4 death resulting from splenic rupture and hemorrhage. The protocol used to infect BALB c mice with RLV and to test drugs for anticancer and or immunostimulating activity is as follows Typical compounds of this invention are active in this test in that they produce a 50 or greater reduction in splenomegaly and a 4 fold or higher increase in hemagglutinin titer to sheep RBCs relative to the placebo treated, RLV infected control mice. Results of this test appear in Tables I and II. Groups of six normal BDF₁ male mice were administered a single dose of test compound by the oral, intravenous IV , intraperitoneal IP or subcutaneous SC route. Six or eighteen hours later, mice were bled from the retro orbital sinus and the serum from each group was pooled. Control mice received a 0.2 Noble agar placebo instead of test compound. Assays of serum interferon were carried out using the semimicroassay of W. E. Stewart 1 . The interferon titer of each serum was defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that produced a 50 reduction in cytopathic effects of vesicular stomatitis virus VSV on monolayers of mouse L 929 cells. The high levels of serum interferon induced in mice, following administration of test compounds, are presented in Table III below. References to this animal model test system are Swiss female mice received a single oral dose of test compound or tilorone analog 2,8 bis N,N dimethyl glycyl dibenzofuran, dihydrochloride Aldrich Chem. Co. on the days indicated in Table IV, prior to lethal subcutaneous virus challenge on day zero with an LD₉₅ of Columbia SK virus. The test drugs were suspended in 1.0 ml of 0.2 aqueous agar solution. The test was evaluated 7 days after virus infection. Non treated controls died with a mean survival time of 4.8 days after infection. The results of this test on typical compounds of this invention appear in Table IV. The compounds of this invention are authentic modulators of humoral and cellular immunity in mice. The compounds induce high levels of circulating interferon, restore antibody production in immuno suppressed mice, protect against lethal virus infection and stimulate NK cell cytotoxicity for tumor cells.
