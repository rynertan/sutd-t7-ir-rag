# Document feed mechanism.

## Abstract
A document feed mechanism comprises a tray 10 for supporting a stack of sheets. The sheets are fed by a shingling system including a wave generator wheel 13 to a ramp 23 . They are then directed by a guide 25 to a feed roll pair 19, 20 . A restraint pad 24 positioned below guide 25 prevents double sheet feed to the roll pair. The guide 25 extends past the feed roll pair to direct sheets to a platen 31 on to which they are fed by feed roll pair 27, 28 and a belt drive system 30 . Single sheets may be fed through guide 22 directly to the feed roll pair 27, 28 .
