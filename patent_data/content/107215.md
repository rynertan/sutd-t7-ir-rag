# Reactor for exothermic or endothermic chemical processes.

## Abstract
A reactor for carrying out exothermic or endothermic chemical reactions in which the reaction temperature is main tained as constant as possible. The reactor comprises a reac tion space 10 , an inlet 15, 18 for at least two reaction com ponents, and an outlet 13 for the reaction products. The reac tor according to the invention is characterized in that the reac tion space is provided with a plurality of interconnected reactor stages 20 through which the reaction stream passes in suc cession, that each reactor stage comprises a plurality of reac tion component guiding means 21, 22 , and that each reactor stage is provided with at least one injection opening 23 for at least one reaction component.
