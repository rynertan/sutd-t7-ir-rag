# TEXTURISING THERMOPLASTIC YARN

## Abstract
Texturising apparatus comprises a yarn feed passage 1 leading to an expansion chamber 10 formed with bleed openings 12 and in which the pressurised gas or fluid passing along the feed passage 1 with the yarn 2 expands laterally to increase the cross section of the yarn. The cross section of the yarn is then reduced again as it enters a discharge passage 16 leading to a crimp chamber 20 in which the yarn is folded upon itself under pressure. The improvement lies in the fact that the expansion chamber 10 has three or more laterally extending passageways 34 into which the filaments of the yarn are forced by the expansion of the fluid or gas, thus greatly enhancing the crimp.
