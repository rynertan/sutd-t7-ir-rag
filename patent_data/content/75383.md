# Device for the treatment of continuous web material.

## Abstract
Treatment apparatus for continuous web 60 for produc ing diecut blanks for example has two sets of treatment rolls 50, 66 and the speed of these is adjusted so that although driven at web speed during the treatment portion of each cycle they are accelerated and retarded or vice versa during the non treatment portion of each cycle so as to synchronise the treatment formes on the rolls with the required web areas and avoid wastage. The speed variation is by control of the drive motors 54 for the rolls 50 , but using roll carried cams con nected to gas springs 78, 80, 82 so that energy can be ab sorbed during retardation and released during acceleration to supplement the motors and thus enable smaller motors to be used.
