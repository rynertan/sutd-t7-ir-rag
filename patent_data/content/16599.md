# Hydrotreating a hydrocarbon stream to remove nitrogen and sulfur and catalyst used in such hydrotreatment.

## Abstract
A process for hydrotreating a hydrocarbon stream to remove nitrogen and sulfur which process comprises contact ing a hydrocarbon stream comprising a stream selected from petroleum distillate, tar sands distillate, and shale oil, with hydrogen and a catalyst comprising a porous refractory inor ganic oxide and deposited thereon hydrogenation compo nents comprising chromium, molybdenum and at least one Group VIII metal, said catalyst having a pore volume distribu tion comprising 20 50 of pore volume in pores with diamet ers of 0 50 Angstrom units, 30 70 of pore volume in pores with diameters of 50 100 Angstrom units, 0 20 of pore vol ume in pores with diameters of 100 150 Angstrom units, and 0 10 of pore volume in pores with diameters greater than 150 Angstrom units.
