# Process for benefication of fluorspar ores.

## Abstract
An improvement is provided in a process for the flotation of an acid grade fluorspar enriched concentrate, having a sulfide sulfur content not greater than about 0.02 , from a fluorspar ore containing in addition to fluorspar substantial amounts of gangue minerals and metallic sulfide accessory minerals. The invention utilizes in this conventional flotation process an alkali metal sulfide, preferably sodium sulfide, as a depressor reagent, in substitution of environmentally objec tionable sodium cyanide, to depress the flotation of metallic sulfide minerals, thereby rendering a flotation concentrate low in sulfide sulfur content while substantially reducing associated environmental effects.
