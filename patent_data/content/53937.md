# Polynuclear fused aromatic ring type polymer and preparation thereof.

## Abstract
A condensation polymer having a Î·sp C 0.1 1.5, containing an anthracene unit in the main chain of the polymer, which is found to have various functions of ultraviolet absorption, fluorescence emission, photoconduc tivity, organic semiconductor characteristics, etc. as well as excellent flexibility and mechanical strength, is prepared by condensation of an anthracenediol compound with a dicar boxylic acid dihalide or a hydrocarbylene dihalide.
