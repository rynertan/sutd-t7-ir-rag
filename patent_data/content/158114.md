## Description
The present invention relates to a transport control system with linear motor drive wherein a carrier having a rotor plate as a secondary conductor is driven along a rail path having a plurality of stator portions upon energization of the stator portions and, more particularly, to a transport control system with linear motor drive wherein a control function is provided in each stator portion having the corresponding stator. The system according to the present invention is used for cash transportation in a bank or the like. The document JP A 59006791, belonging to the technologcal background only, shows a system for controlling a driving of a linear induction motor and a main control unit MPU for generally controlling the control circuits. This document does not disclose any further features teaching in the direction of the present invention. As a transport means, the linear motor car has attracted a great deal of attention, since high speed transportation can be achieved thereby without the need to mount a power source in the carrier. In a conventional linear motor car system, a plurality of stator portions are coupled to a rail path, and a rotor plate is mounted in a carrier. An electric force is supplied to the rotor plate by energizing the corresponding stator portion, thereby driving the carrier. When the stator portion is deenergized, the carrier is stopped. Therefore, once the carrier receives the driving force from a given stator portion, it needs no additional external force and will run freely until reaching the next stator portion. At a carrier stoppage position, the carrier is stopped by a reverse driving force output from the corresponding stator portion. In such a linear motor car, the carrier itself need not include a power source but is driven only by energization of the stator portions coupled to the rail path. Therefore, the carrier can be moved at a high speed and can be made compact in size, thereby minimizing the overall dimensions of the transport system and making it particularly suitable for document transportation in an office, or the like. In a conventional linear motor car system, the respective stator portions coupled along the rail path are sequentially energized deenergized by a linear motor controller when the carrier is running. Thus, the carrier is started, accelerated, decelerated or stopped and is driven from a desired stator portion to another desired stator portion. The linear motor controller controls the respective stators in accordance with the running state of the carrier in such a manner that when the carrier passes through a stator portion, it is controlled to run at a predetermined speed or it is stopped. In a conventional transport control system wherein a carrier is driven along a rail path having stator portions, a system controller microprocessor supplies running instructions to a linear motor controller microprocessor in accordance with running requests from associated equipment e.g., an auto cashier . The linear motor controller controls the stators arranged in stator portions along the rail path for driving the carrier. The carrier is started from a start position a given stator portion , is accelerated or decelerated to pass through subsequent stator portions, and is stopped at a desired stop position another given stator portion . In such a conventional control system, the linear motor controller must always detect an operating status of each stator portion and directly control the stator in such a manner that the carrier is running at a desired speed at the corresponding stator portion. This condition means that the linear motor controller alone receives and processes a plurality of status signals from the respective stator portions, and thus the processing capacity is limited. When the number of stator portions is small, this limitation will not cause any significant problems. However, when the number of stator portions is increased or the distance between each two adjacent stator portions is very short, the processing capacity of the linear motor controller cannot cope with the actual number of processing requests. To overcome this obstacle, the carrier must be driven at a low speed, which causes some inconvenience. Also, when a system layout is changed, the processing contents of the linear motor controller must be updated, and the operation becomes complicated. In addition, since the processing capacity is limited, processing a malfunction or failure is likewise limited, and during an operation failure, control of the carrier may be interrupted, with the result that business operations are temporarily halted. It is an object of the present invention to ensure that properly coordinated operations are carried out between a main controller and stator controllers for carrier transport control when a linear motor drive is employed, and to carry out preliminary control for the linear motor drive and subsequent control of the carrier when it arrives at each stator controller, thereby driving the carrier accurately and at a high speed. This object is achieved by the features of Claims 1, 2 4 and 5. Before the preferred embodiments of the present invention are described, the prior art will be described with reference to Figs. 1 and 2 to give a better understanding of the present invention. As shown in Fig. 1, in a conventional transport control system wherein a carrier 6 is driven along a rail path 5 coupled to a plurality of stators 4 1 to 4 n , a system controller 1 supplies an instruction to a linear motor controller 2 in accordance with a request from associated equipment 8. The linear motor controller 2 controls the stators 4 1 to 4 n for driving the carrier 6. The carrier 6 is started from a start position e.g., the stator 4 1 , accelerated or decelerated to pass by subsequent stators and stopped at a desired stop position e.g., the stator 4 n . According to the conventional system of this type, the linear motor controller 2 constantly detects the status of each stator and directly controls the stator in such a manner that, upon reaching the stator, the carrier 6 is running at a desired velocity. Accordingly, the linear motor controller 2 must receive and process a plurality of status signals from the respective stators, and as a result, the processing capacity of the controller 2 is limited. This factor causes little trouble when the number of stators is small, however, when the number of stators is large or the distance between every two adjacent stators is short, the processing capacity of the linear motor controller 2 cannot cope with the increased number of processing requests. Therefore, the speed of the carrier must be decreased. When a system layout is modified, the processing contents of the linear motor controller 2 must be updated, and as a result, the operations become complicated. In addition, since the processing capacity is limited, if a failure occurs then processing is interrupted and the carrier may be temporarily out of control. Assume that among the four stators 4 1 to 4 4 along the rail path 5 the stator 4 1 is defined as the start position, that the stator 4 4 is defined as the stop position, and that the remaining stators 4 2 and 4 3 are used for accelerating decelerating the carrier 6 as in the conventional linear motor system. Conventionally, the linear motor controller 2 sends a start command STR to the stator 4 1 , as shown in Fig. 2 1 , to start the carrier 6 from the stator 4 1 . After the carrier 6 is started, the controller 2 sends an acceleration deceleration command SPC to the stator 4 2 , as shown in Fig. 2 2 , to accelerate or decelerate the carrier 6 at the stator 4 2 . As shown in Fig. 2 3 , the controller 2 then sends the command SPC to the stator 4 3 to accelerate or decelerate the carrier 6 at the stator 4 3 . When the carrier 6 passes by the stator 4 3 , the controller 2 sends a stop command STP to the stator 4 4 , as shown in Fig. 2 4 , thereby stopping the carrier 6 at the stator 4 4 . In normal operation, the control operation in Fig. 2 is performed in such a manner that the stators are sequentially controlled by following the movement of the carrier 6 along the rail path. However, if a failure occurs, then a run away of the carrier 6 cannot be prevented. When a failure occurs at an interface between the linear motor controller and the stators 4 2 , 4 3 , and 4 4 , even if a command is sent to these stators after the carrier 6 has left the stator 4 1 , the carrier 6 will not operate normally. In this case, the carrier 6 will not be correctly controlled at these stators 4 2 to 4 4 and a run away of the carrier 6 may occur. During normal operation, the controller 2 supplies a given command or instruction to a given stator immediately before the carrier reaches the given stator. When a failure in operation of the stator or the like is detected upon sending of the command, the carrier 6 can no longer be controlled since it is about to reach the given stator. As a result, a run away of the carrier 6 cannot be prevented. A transport control system with linear motor drive is shown in Fig. 3. Referring to Fig. 3, reference numeral 1 denotes a system controller for controlling the entire system on the basis of a request from, e.g., a teller s counter, as the request source and 2, a linear motor controller for controlling the respective stators 4 1 to 4 n in response to transport instructions from the system controller 1. Reference numerals 3 1 , 3 2 , ..., and 3 n denote stator controllers coupled to the stators 4 1 to 4 n , respectively. The stator controllers 3 1 to 3 n energize the corresponding stators in response to instructions sent through cables 25, 26, and 27, thereby controlling the driving of the carrier 6. Each stator controller 3 1 to 3 n comprises a microprocessor. The linear controller 2 is connected to the stator controllers 3 1 to 3 n in accordance with the multi drop method shown in Fig. 3, or they may be connected in parallel with each other, as shown in Fig. 4. The main feature of the present invention lies in the arrangement wherein the stator controllers 3 1 to 3 n having a control function are respectively coupled to the stators 4 1 to 4 n , receive instructions and data from the linear motor controller 2, are set in the designated operating modes, and energize the corresponding stators to control the speed of the carrier in the designated operating modes. The linear motor controller 2 thus sends an operating mode instruction and speed data to each of the stators 4 1 to 4 n . The actual operations of the stators 4 1 to 4 n are controlled by the stator controllers 3 1 to 3 n , respectively. Each of the stator controllers 3 1 to 3 n has, as basic operating modes, a neutral mode for making the corresponding stator inactive, a start mode for energizing the corresponding stator 4 1 to 4 n to start the carrier, an acceleration deceleration mode for making the corresponding stator 4 1 to 4 n accelerate or decelerate the carrier, and a stop mode for stopping the carrier. Each stator controller 3 1 to 3 n is set in any one of the above basic modes in response to an instruction from the linear motor controller 2. Each stator 4 1 to 4 n controls the speed of the carrier 6 in the given operating mode in such a manner that the carrier 6 is smoothly driven from the start position to the stop position. Upon nearing the stop position, the carrier 6 is decelerated and stopped in such a manner that it does not come in contact with the stator at the stop position. Since the stator controllers 3 1 to 3 n having a control function are respectively coupled to the stators 4 1 to 4 n , run away prevention control and speed control can be performed as follows. As described above, a given operating mode can be set by an instruction command to perform run away prevention control. Assume that the stator 4 1 among the four stators 4 1 to 4 4 along the rail path 5 is defined as the start position, stator 4 4 as the stop position, and the remaining stators 4 2 and 4 3 are used for accelerating decelerating the carrier 6 as in the conventional linear motor system. Conventionally, the linear motor controller 2 sends the start command STR to the stator 4 1 , as shown in Fig. 2 1 , to start the carrier 6 from the stator 4 1 . After the carrier 6 is started, the controller 2 sends the acceleration deceleration command SPC to the stator 4 2 , as shown in Fig. 2 2 , to accelerate or decelerate the carrier 6 at the stator 4 2 . As shown in Fig. 2 3 , the controller 2 then sends the command SPC to the stator 4 3 to accelerate or decelerate the carrier 6 at the stator 4 3 . When the carrier 6 passes by the stator 4 3 , the controller 2 sends the stop command STP to the stator 4 4 , as shown in Fig. 2 4 , thereby stopping the carrier 6 at the stator 4 4 . The conventional control operation in Fig. 2 is performed in such a manner that the stators are sequentially controlled by the movement of the carrier 6 along the rail path. However, in normal operation of a conventional control, if a failure occurs, a run away of the carrier 6 cannot be prevented. When a failure in operation of an interface between the linear motor controller 2 and the stators 4 2 , 4 3 and 4 4 occurs, proper operation may not be carried out if the operating commands are sent to the stators 4 2 , 4 3 and 4 4 after the carrier 6 is started from the stator 4 1 . For this reason, control failures may occur in the stators 4 2 to 4 4 , or there may be no control at all, resulting in a run away of the carrier 6. In normal operation, the controller 2 supplies a given command or instruction to a given stator immediately before the carrier reaches the given stator. When a failure in operation of the stator or the like is detected upon sending of the command, the carrier 6 can no longer be controlled since it is about to reach the given stator, and as a result, a run away of the carrier 6 cannot be prevented. However, according to the system shown in Fig. 3, a command is sent to a given stator in advance, the given stator is set in a given operating mode represented by this command, and thereafter the carrier 6 is driven. More particularly, as shown in Fig. 5, when a command is supplied from the system controller 1 to the linear motor controller 2, among the stators 4 1 to 4 4 associated with driving the carrier, the stators 4 2 to 4 4 excluding the stator 4 1 as the start position stator and the stator 4 5 next to the stator 4 4 as the stop position stator receive their respective operating commands. In other words, the linear motor controller 2 sends the command SPC to the stator controllers 3 2 and 3 3 for the stators 4 2 and 4 3 and the stop command STP to the stator controllers 3 4 and 3 5 for the stators 4 4 and 4 5 . As shown in Fig. 5, when the stators 4 2 and 4 3 are operating normally, they are set from the neutral mode to the acceleration deceleration mode. Similarly, when the stators 4 4 and 4 5 are operating normally, they are set from the neutral mode to the stop mode. The linear motor controller 2 then sends the commands to check the operation modes of the stators 4 2 to 4 4 and 4 5 , as follows. The linear motor controller 2 sends the command signal SNS to the stators 4 2 to 4 4 and 4 5 to establish the proper operation modes at these stators and to check if these stators have correctly switched to the designated operation modes. If only one of the stators 4 2 to 4 4 and 4 5 has not switched to the designated operation mode, a failure of the stator or interface is determined and an error is indicated. When the linear motor controller 2 detects that the stations 4 2 to 4 4 and 4 5 are properly set in the designated operating modes, the controller 2 sends the start command STR to the stator 4 1 , as shown in Fig. 5. The stator 4 1 is then switched from the neutral mode to the start mode, thereby starting the carrier 6. When the carrier 6 is started from the stator 4 1 , the stator 4 1 is set to the stop mode STP as shown in Fig. 5. The carrier 6 is sequentially driven and subjected to acceleration deceleration control. When the carrier 6 passes by the stator 4 2 , the stator 4 2 is set to the stop mode STP in the same manner as the stator 4 1 , as shown in Fig. 5. Similarly, after the carrier 6 is accelerated or decelerated by the stator 4 3 , the stator 4 3 is set to the stop mode STP in the same manner as the stators 4 1 and 4 2 . Thus, if the carrier 6 is repelled by any one of the stators 4 2 and 4 3 and driven backwards, it can be stopped since the previous stator is set to the stop mode STP when the carrier 6 has passed that stator, and as a result, a run away of the carrier 6 can be prevented. The carrier 6 is stopped by the stator 4 4 . If a failure occurs in the stator 4 4 , then the carrier 6 is stopped by the stator 4 5 . During the above operation, the linear motor controller 2 sends a sense command SNS to the stators 4 1 to 4 4 to check their operating states and monitor the running status of the carrier 6. Speed control can be performed by the stator controller as follows. For example, as shown in Fig. 6, when the carrier 6 is driven from the stator 4 1 to the stator 4 7 , the carrier 6 is started from the stator 4 1 at maximum speed. The carrier 6 then passes by the stators 4 2 and 4 3 , still at maximum speed, is then gradually decelerated through the stators 4 4 , 4 5 , and 4 6 , and finally, is stopped at the stator 4 7 . Since the carrier 6 must be stopped in such a manner that it does not come in contact with the stator 4 7 , the speed of the carrier 6 must be gradually decelerated to a speed at which the carrier 6 can be immediately stopped near the stator 4 7 . The speed characteristic curve is set to achieve the above operation, and the linear motor controller 2 controls the stators in accordance with this curve. In practice, when the rail path comprises a linear path, a curved path, an ascending slope path, or a descending slope path, the required speed of the carrier 6 varies. For example, when a rail path between the stators 4 6 and 4 7 is a linear portion, as shown in Fig. 6, speed data V 0 is sent to the stator 4 6 so as to set the passing speed of the carrier 6 to V 0 . However, when the rail path comprises a descending slope portion, the speed V 0 is too high and the carrier 6 may be derailed. In this case, the carrier passing speed at the stator 4 6 must be set to V lower than the speed V 0 . However, when the rail path comprises an ascending slope or curved path, the speed V 0 is so low that the carrier 6 may stop of its own accord. Therefore, the carrier passing speed at the stator 4 6 must be set to V higher than the speed V 0 . This also can be applied to a rail path between any two adjacent stators. Therefore, for the above reasons, speed control must be performed in accordance with the shape of the rail path. To this end, the linear motor controller 2 calculates the instructed speeds, to be sent to the respective stators in accordance with the shape of the rail paths between every two adjacent stators, on the basis of a basic speed control pattern. This calculated instruction speed data then must be sent to the respective stators. When the rail path has predetermined start and stop position stators, only an actual speed pattern is determined. However, when the start and stop position stators are not determined and the carrier 6 is to be started from any stator and stopped at any other stator, the linear motor controller must calculate the instructed speeds to be sent to the respective stators on the basis of the basic speed control pattern. Accordingly, the linear motor controller requires a program for speed calculation and a heavy calculation load is imposed. In addition, speed commands cannot be given to the corresponding stators until the calculation is completed. Therefore, the processing time required from a transport request to actual transport is prolonged, thereby partially degrading the high speed transport performance as a whole. As shown in Fig. 7, speed data a maximum speed that will allow the carrier to pass safely along the rail path, a minimum speed, and a correction value for a rail path shape having a combination of linear, curved, ascending slope, and descending slope paths is prepared. The proper speed data is selected in accordance with the shape of the rail path portions extending between every two adjacent stators. The linear motor controller 2 supplies a designation value to each stator, in accordance with the basic speed control characteristic curve in Fig. 6, when the carrier 6 is driven. Each of the stator controllers 3 1 to 3 3 determines a control speed in accordance with the above designation value and the speed data. The speed data is set in the following manner. The linear motor controller 2 simultaneously sends a Table 21 to be described in detail later of Fig. 7 to the stator controllers 3 1 to 3 n for all stators, to enable the stators to select the proper data in accordance with the shapes of the rail path portions extending between every two adjacent stators. Namely, the speed data may be set in such a manner that the linear motor controller 2 selects the proper speed data in accordance with the shapes of the rail path portions connected to the two ends of each stator on the basis of the Table 21 of Fig. 7. In this manner, the load of the linear motor controller 2 is decreased and a smooth speed control is carried out. Figure 8 is a schematic view of an application showing a cash transportation system in a bank. Referring to Fig. 8, reference symbol CT denotes a teller s counter at which customers can request a transaction to be made, such as a deposit, withdrawal, or transfer transaction. Reference symbol OTM denotes an on line teller machine. A teller enters the transaction data requested by a customer at the teller machine OTM. The teller machine OTM has a keyboard, a display, and a printer and is connected to a system controller not shown . Reference symbol TAD denotes a teller cash reception unit which receives cash inserted by the teller and counts the total amount of cash inserted STW, a terminal writer for printing transaction data on an inserted passbook and CA and CB, cash insertion dispensing ports, respectively. The teller places cash on the carrier 6 driven along the rail path 5 through the cash insertion dispensing port CA and removes cash from the carrier 6 through the cash insertion dispensing port CB. Reference symbol AC denotes a cash reception dispensing unit which comprises a cash dispensing unit ACU and a cash reception unit ACU. The cash is transported from the cash dispensing unit ADU to the carrier 6 along the rail path 5 in response to a cash dispensing instruction from the system controller 1 Fig. 3 , and the cash is removed from the carrier 6 to the cash reception unit ADU in response to a cash reception instruction. Reference symbol CCU denotes an consulting unit terminal which is an associated equipment and which comprises a display and a keyboard. A consulting instruction is entered at the terminal CCU, which is supplied to the system controller 1 Fig. 3 , and a consulting result is displayed at the terminal CCU. The operation of the cash transport system will be described hereinafter. The carrier CR is driven back and forth between the teller s counter CT and the cash dispensing unit AC so as to transport cash therebetween. When a deposit transaction is to be performed, the carrier 6 carries cash from the cash insertion dispensing port CA or CB or the teller cash insertion unit TAD and is started along the rail path 5. The carrier 6 is then stopped at the cash reception unit ADU. The cash reception unit ADU receives the cash from the carrier 6. Thereafter, the carrier 6 returns to the counter CT. However, when a withdrawal transaction is to be performed, the carrier 6 is started from the counter CT and is stopped at the cash dispensing unit ACU. The carrier 6 then receives cash from the ACU unit, is driven along the rail path 5 and is stopped at a requested cash insertion dispensing port station CA or CB. The teller then removes the cash from the carrier 6. The stations CA and CB are provided with stators coupled to the rail path 5 so that the carrier 6 can be started, accelerated, decelerated, and stopped by the linear motor controller at the stations CA and CB. Figure 9 shows the arrangement of stators along the rail path. The stators 4 1 , 4 2 , and 4 3 are arranged in such a manner that the carrier 6 can be started from, accelerated or decelerated, or stopped at the cash insertion port CA, the teller cash reception unit TAD, or the dispensing port CB. The stators 4 4 , 4 5 , 4 6 and 4 7 are arranged to accelerate or decelerate the carrier 6 at sloped and curved portions of the rail path 5. The stators 4 8 and 4 9 are arranged in such a manner that the carrier 6 can be started from, accelerated or decelerated, or stopped at the cash dispensing unit ACU and the cash reception unit ADU, respectively. The start stop position stations 4 1 , 4 2 , 4 3 , 4 8 and 4 9 have carrier lift mechanisms to be described later , respectively. The rail path 5 comprises the elements shown in Figs. 10, 11, and 12. The rail path 5 shown in Fig. 9 is constituted by a combination of the linear paths 5 LINEAR of Fig. 10, the curved paths 5 CURVE of Fig. 11, and the sloped paths 5 SLOPE of Fig. 12. Figure 13 shows the constructions of the carrier and the stator, respectively. Reference numeral Figure 13 also shows a perspective view of a stator, in which reference numerals 410 and 411 denote bases, respectively and 412 and 413, guide portions, respectively. The guide portions 412 and 413 are spaced apart by a gap into which the rotor plate 602 of the carrier 6 can be inserted in such a manner that there is no contact between them. The guide portions 412 and 413 have core portions mounted thereon, respectively. Reference numerals 414 and 415 denote these coil portions, each of which comprises a driving coil, an aligning coil, and an acceleration deceleration coil. The linear motor drive comprising the carrier and the stator shown in Fig. 13 will now be described with reference to Figs. 14, 15, and 16. As shown in Fig. 16, a pair of U shaped rails 51 and 52 are fixed on the left and right sides of the rail path 5. The stator 4 is disposed between the rails 51 and 52. Four transmitting photoelectric sensors 531, 532, 533, and 534 are mounted on the rail 51 at each stator 4 position. The sensors 531 and 534 are mounted at positions corresponding to the front and rear ends of the stator 4 and detect the slit portion 607 of the carrier 6, to determine whether or not the carrier 6 is arriving at the stator 4 or has passed by the stator 4. The sensors 532 and 533 are arranged at positions for aligning the stator. The outputs from the sensors 531 to 534 are also used for detecting the speed of the carrier 6. As shown in Figs. 14 and 15, the upper and lower guide rollers 6051 and 6052 hold the upper portion of the rail 51 in rolling contact, and the side guide roller 6053 is brought into rolling contact with the side surface of the rail 51, thereby guiding and holding the carrier 6 in all directions along and to the rails 51 and 52. In this state, the rotor plate 602 of the carrier 6 is floating between the guide portions 413 and 414 of the stator in a position such that it can receive a magnetic flux from the stator. The slit portion 607 of the carrier 6 is on the same level as that of the sensors 531 to 534. When the stator is energized, the carrier 6 is started, accelerated, decelerated, or stopped along the rails 51 and 52. At the same time, the position and speed of the carrier 6 are detected by the sensors 531 to 534. Figures 17, 18, 19, and 20 show a carrier lift mechanism, a rail cover mechanism, and a shutter opening closing mechanism for each of the stators 4 1 , 4 2 , 4 3 , 4 8 , and 4 9 shown in Fig. 9. Referring to Figs. 17, 19, and 20, reference numerals 580 and 581 denote a pair of guide columns for vertically guiding the carrier 6 and 582 and 583, slider blocks which are respectively vertically moved along the guide columns 580 and 581. The slider blocks 582 and 583 have rail elements 511 and 521 as parts of the rails 51 and 52 at their distal ends, respectively. Reference numeral 584 denotes a link mechanism 585, a lift motor and 586, a gear. The front end of the link mechanism 584 is connected to the slider block 581, and the rear end of the link mechanism 584 is connected to a shaft of the gear 586. When the lift motor 585 is rotated, the gear 586 is rotated to actuate the link mechanism 584. Reference numerals 561 and 562 denote upper and lower limit detection switches, respectively. These switches 561 and 562 are operated by the slider block 583 to detect the upper and lower limits of the lift mechanism, respectively. The above components constitute the lift mechanism. Referring to Figs. 17 and 18, reference numerals 540 and 541 denote rail cover levers, respectively. The levers 540 and 541 have rail elements 5202 and 5212 at their upper ends and can be pivoted about pivot pins 551 and 552, respectively. Reference numerals 542 and 543 denote link mechanisms for pivoting the rail cover levers 540 and 541, respectively and 544 and 545, gears, respectively. One end of each of the link mechanisms 542 and 543 is connected to a corresponding one of the gears 544 and 545. Reference numeral 546 denotes a rail cover motor for driving the gear 544 and 547, a frame for supporting the motor 546, the gears 544 and 545 and the rail cover levers 540 and 541. Reference numeral 57 denotes a rail cover opening closing detection switch which is operated upon pivotal movement of the rail cover lever 540 to detect the positions of the rail elements 5202 and 5212. The above components constitute the rail cover mechanism. The rail elements 511 and 512 are normally withdrawn, as shown in Figs 14, 15 and 16. The rail elements 5202 and 5212 compensate for the rail elements 511 and 512 when the rail elements 511 and 512 are lifted by the lift mechanism and are separated from the rails 51 and 52 so that they will not interfere with the movement of the carrier 6, as shown in Fig. 17. However, when only one carrier is in use, the rail elements 5202 and 5212 need not be used. Reference numeral 750 denotes a shutter corresponding to a cover of the cash insertion dispensing ports CA and CB 751, a shutter motor for opening closing the shutter 750 752, a link mechanism for opening closing the shutter 750 upon rotation of the motor 751 and 76, a shutter opening closing detection switch which is engaged with part of the shutter 750 to detect opening closing of the shutter 750. The above components constitute a shutter opening closing mechanism. The shutter opening closing mechanism is arranged only in each of the stators 4 1 and 4 2 corresponding to the cash insertion dispensing ports CA and CB. The operation of the above mechanisms will be described with reference to Figs. 17, 18, 19, and 20. In the normal state, parts of the rails 51 and 52 are constituted by rail elements 511 and 512, respectively, as shown in Fig. 17. When the carrier 6 is stopped and aligned by the stator, the lift motor 585 is rotated in the direction indicated by arrow in Fig. 20 from the state of Fig. 19. The gear 586 is rotated to actuate the link mechanism 584 and lift the slider blocks 582 and 583 along the guide columns 580 and 581. The carrier 6 is moved together with the rail elements 511 and 512. When the slider block 583 reaches the upper limit, a switch 562 is operated to stop the motor 585. Therefore, the state shown in Figs. 18 and 20 is achieved. The rail elements 511 and 512 are separated from the rails 51 and 52, respectively. Under this condition, another carrier cannot pass through this stator. For this reason, the motor 546 of the rail cover mechanism is rotated in the direction indicated by arrow in Fig. 18 to rotate the gear 544 and the gear 545 meshed therewith. The link mechanisms 542 and 543 are operated to pivot the rail cover levers 540 and 541 about the pivot pins 551 and 552 of Fig. 18 from the state of Fig. 17. The omitted portions of the rails 51 and 52 are thus compensated by the rail elements 5202 and 5212 mounted at the upper ends of the levers 540 and 541, respectively. When the carrier 6 reaches the upper limit, the motor 751 is rotated to actuate the link mechanism 752, thereby closing the shutter 750, as shown in Fig. 18. The teller can then insert the transported object in or remove it from the carrier 6. The process from the state of Fig. 18 to that of Fig. 17 is then performed in reverse to return the carrier 6 to and start it on the rails 51 and 52. Figure 21 is a detailed block diagram of one of the stator controllers 3 1 to 3 n shown in Fig. 3. Reference numeral 30 denotes a stator CPU having an internal memory RAM 301. The stator CPU 30 exchanges data and commands with the linear motor controller 2 and data and flags with a motor CPU and a mechanism CPU to be described later. The stator CPU 30 serves as a relay CPU. Reference numeral 31 denotes a motor CPU which controls energization of a stator in response to an instruction from the stator CPU 30. The motor CPU 31 has a speed measurement counter 311 and a memory RAM 312. Reference numeral 32 denotes a multiplexer responsive to a selection signal SEL to select the outputs from the sensors 531 to 534 for detecting the slit portion 607 of the carrier 6. A selected detection signal is supplied from the multiplexer 32 to the motor CPU 31. Reference numeral 33 denotes a rail path shape switch at which the operator enters rail path shape data linear, curve, ascending slope, descending slope, etc. in accordance with the shapes of the rail path portions extending between every two adjacent stators. The input rail path shape data is fetched by the motor CPU 31. Reference numeral 34 denotes a coil driver network having drives 341, 342, and 343 which are arranged by solid state relays. The driver 341 applies an AC voltage to an accelerating decelerating AC coil 4142 of the stator 4 in accordance with a direction right or left instruction from the motor CPU 31. The driver 342 drives an aligning single phase coil 4141 of the stator 4 in response to an alignment command PCMD from the motor CPU 31. The driver 343 drives a damping coil 4143 of the stator 4 in response to a damping command SCMD from the motor CPU 31. Reference numeral 35 denotes an interface circuit having flag portions 351 and 352 for exchanging flags with the stator CPU 30 and registers 353 and 354 for exchanging commands and data with the stator CPU 30. Reference numeral 36 denotes a first bus through which flags, data, and commands are exchanged between the stator CPU 30 and the interface circuit 35. Reference numeral 37 denotes a second bus through which flags, data, and commands are exchanged between the stator CPU 30 and an interface circuit of a mechanism CPU 382. The mechanism CPU 382 has an internal memory RAM 3821. The mechanism CPU 382 controls the motors 585, 546, and 751 of the lift, rail cover, and shutter opening closing mechanisms described with reference to Fig. 17. Reference numeral 381 denotes an interface circuit having flag portions 3811 and 3812 for exchanging flags with the stator CPU 30 through the bus 37, and registers 3813 and 3814 for exchanging commands and data with the stator CPU 30 through the bus 37. Note, reference numerals 3832, 3842, and 3852 denote drivers of the motors 585, 546, and 751, respectively, and a mechanism control unit 38 is arranged only in each of the stators 4 1 , 4 2 , 4 3 , 4 8 , and 4 9 which are provided with lift mechanisms, as shown in Fig. 9. The method described with reference to Fig. 3 and the operation of the apparatus shown in Fig. 21 will be described with reference to an input output signal chart of Fig. 22. In this manner, the start and acceleration deceleration stators are set in the stop mode when the corresponding control operations are completed. Thus, even if the carrier is repelled by a stator next to a given stator, whose mode is switched to the stop mode, and is returned to the given stator, the carrier can be stopped, thereby providing a transport system with high reliability. The start mode, the acceleration deceleration mode, and the stop mode will be described with reference to flow charts of Figs. 23, 24, 25, 26, and 27. When the motor CPU determines that the high speed stop is to be performed upon entrance of the carrier i.e., in response to an output from the sensor 531 or 534 , the motor CPU causes the driver 341 to energize the coil 4142. When the outputs from the sensors 532 and 533 are generated and the carrier has reached the aligning position, the drivers 342 and 343 are driven to energize the coils 4141 and 4143, thereby aligning the carrier with the stator. When the motor CPU determines that the middle speed stop is to be performed, the drivers 342 and 343 are driven upon entrance of the carrier, thereby energizing the coils 4141 and 4143. When the motor CPU determines that the low speed stop is to be performed, the drivers 342 and 343 are operated to energize the coils 4141 and 4143 upon simultaneous generation of the outputs from the sensors 532 and 533. In the stop mode, the stop control data is determined after the stop command STP is received, and the stator is ready for receiving the carrier. When the carrier is actually entered above the stator, a braking force acts on the carrier so as to correspond to the inertial force of the carrier, thereby stably stopping the carrier. For this reason, even if the carrier is of light weight, it will not be repelled by a large braking force and will not return to the immediately preceding stator. In addition, even if the carrier carrying a heavy weight, it will not pass over the stator due to small braking force. The operation of the mechanism CPU will be described hereinafter. When the carrier is stopped at the stop stator in the manner described above, the linear motor controller sends a lift up instruction to the stator CPU through the cable. The stator CPU sends this instruction to the mechanism CPU through the bus and the interface circuit. The mechanism CPU 382 causes the driver 3832 to drive the motor 535, so that the slider block 583 is moved upward as described with reference to Fig. 17. Therefore, the carrier is moved upward together with the slider block 583. The mechanism CPU 382 monitors a signal from the switch 561. When the mechanism CPU 382 detects that the carrier has reached the upper limit in accordance with the output signal from the switch 561, the motor 585 is stopped. The mechanism CPU 382 then causes the driver 3842 to operate the rail cover mechanism so as to compensate for the omitted portions of the rails. The motor 751 is driven by the driver 3852 to open the shutter 750. The teller can then remove an object from or place it on the carrier 6 through the insertion dispensing port CA or CB. In order to place the object on the carrier and start the carrier, a lift down instruction is generated from the linear motor controller, and an operation opposite to that described above is performed under the control of the mechanism CPU 382, and the carrier 6 is moved downward and placed on the rails. Thereafter, the transport control as described above is performed to start the carrier 6. As described above, in order to cancel the stop mode of the stator, a cancel command CAN is sent from the linear motor controller to the respective stators which are then set in the neutral mode. The present invention is exemplified by the above described particular embodiment. In the above embodiment, the maximum and minimum speed data shown in Fig. 7 are used as the control speed data. However, the correction value based upon the rail path shape of Fig. 7 may be used in place of the maximum and minimum speed data. In this case, the standard speed control characteristic curve is prepared for a linear rail path. The correction data for the rail path shapes e.g., curve and ascending slope are calculated. The correction data are supplied as the speed data to the motor CPU and are stored in the speed table. The correction data corresponding to the rail path shape is added to the designated speed derived by the linear motor controller from the standard speed control characteristic curve. Furthermore, a means may be provided for detecting an overlap portion between a prospective running region and the actual running region of the carrier. In this case, the carrier is started when such regions do not overlap. Furthermore, a means may provided for detecting a failure in operation of the stator controller. In this case, when the failure occurs, the destination stator is updated, and the carrier is then started.
