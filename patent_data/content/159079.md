## Description
The present invention concerns an audio amplifier switch on control circuit. It is known that in audio, TV and radio equipment, interference can be produced, upon switching on, at the audio amplifier outlet, that is in the loudspeaker, due to settling defects in the upstream circuits. Such disturbances are commonly called switch on noise . It is also known that in such equipment the stand by function is sometimes provided, which means holding the equipment in a waiting condition with minimum absorption, which allows subsequent turning on again of the power part by nonpower telecontrol or switch. Switching on again after stand by must naturally take place without noise production, that is with an appropriate delay in audio amplifier switch an time. An audio frequency power amplifier provided with a control circuit according to the preamble of claim 1 is disclosed in EP A 0 043 707. The primary object of the present invention is to accomplish a new audio amplifier control circuit capable of appropriately delaying the audio amplifier switch on time upon each new switching on of the equipment, however controlled. Another object of the present invention is to accomplish an audio amplifier control circuit also capable of causing switching off, and then correct switching on again, of the audio amplifier after a stand by command. In view of these objects, the control circuit according to the invention is realized as set forth in claim 1. It appears evident that the time necessary for the load voltage of the capacitor to reach first the intervention threshold of the oscillating circuit and then carry the circuit into the second operating state represents the switch on delay of the audio amplifier after the instant the equipment is switched on. This delay time can of course be selected so as to be certainly greater than the time necessary for the settling of the circuits which generate the audio signal. The bothersome switch on noise is thus avoided. The control circuit according to the invention also makes possible turning off of the audio amplifier, with a resulting reduced current absorption, following a stand by command. To accomplish this it is sufficient to short circuit and hence discharge to earth, by means of an appropriate switch, the capacitor which controls the oscillating circuit. By so doing, the oscillating circuit is caused to return to the initial state, taking away switching on current from the audio amplifier and thereby causing it to be extinguished. Upon switching on again after stand by, that is upon reopening of the aforesaid switch, the capacitor can also recharge itself and return, with the usual preset time delay, the oscillating circuit to the state of generation of the switch on current for the audio amplifier. These and other characteristics of the present invention will be made evident by the following detailed description of two possible forms of practical accomplishment illustrated as examples in the annexed drawings, wherein With reference to Fig. 1, A indicates an audio amplifier equipped with a positive input E, a negative input F and an output L for control of a loudspeaker AP. A feedback circuit between output L and input F includes a resistance R₅. A capacitor C₄ is inserted between the output L and the loudspeaker AP. The positive input E is connected by a resistance R₆ to a circuital node N connected to the main power supply V The input E is also connected by a capacitor C₅ to an audio signal input lN, to which arrives the audio signal processed by the upstream circuits, generally represented and indicated by GS. The negative input F is in turn connected to the power supply V Switching on of the amplifier A is provided for by a current generator G₂, which generates a switch on current I₂. Current generators G₁ and G₂ are controlled by a circuital block B, which in turn is controlled by the voltage in a circuital node D connected to the power supply V A more detailed illustration of the circuital block B, as well as the generators G₁ and G₂ controlled by it, is given in Fig. 2, in which it is seen that circuital node D is connected to the base, connected to earth by a zener diode Z₁, of an n p n transistor T₁ the emitter of which is connected to earth through the series of a resistance R₇ and a diode D₁ and the collector connected to the positive power supply V The collector of transistor T₁ is also connected to the base of a p n p transistor T₂, the emitter of which is connected to the power supply V The base of transistor T₁ and a circuital node M intermediate between the two resistances R₈ and R₉ are connected, the first through a diode D₃ and the second directly, to the bases of their respective n p n transistors T₃ and T₇, which together form an oscillating circuit CB shiftable from one to the other of two operating states under the control of the voltages in nodes D and M. More precisely, the two transistors T₃ and T₇ have their respective emitters connected through equal resistances R₁₀ and R₁₁ to the collector of an n p n transistor T₆, the emitter of which is connected to earth and the base of which is connected to earth and of which the base is connected to a node intermediate between resistances R₉ and diode D₆. The collectors of transistors T₃ and T₇ are also connected to the positive power supply V To the collectors of transistors T₃ and T₇ are also connected the bases of their respective p n p transistors T₄ and T₅, the emitters of which are connected to the power supply V The manner of operation of the control circuit of Figs. 1 and 2 can be understood with the help of the illustrative charts shown in Figs. 3 5. As shown in Fig. 3, from the moment of switching on of the equipment t 0 the positive power supply V At the moment when V As capacitor C₁ continues to be charged, when the charging voltage V As V The described variation of currents I₁ and I₂ under the control of tie circuital block B causes the following behaviour of the audio amplifier A in response to the switching on of the equipment. The current generator G₁ is connected to the inverting input F of the amplifier A and starting from instant T The current generator G₂, which is assigned to switching on of the amplifier A, remains in turn cut off until instant T₁ In the meantime however, as shown in Fig. 5, the inverting input F of the amplifier A was held at a voltage V As shown in Fig. 5, voltage V The audio amplifier then becomes dynamic with a time delay T₄ after the instant the equipment is switched on. For all of this time the loudspeaker does not receive signals and hence does not produce sound. The upstream circuits, which generate the audio signal for the input lN, thus have time to settle. As already mentioned, the control circuit of Figs. 1 and 2 also provides for the possibility of placing the audio amplifier A, and the control circuit itself, in stand by condition, that is in minimum current absorption condition. To achieve this it is sufficient to close the switch IS of Fig. 1, so as to bring about the discharge to earth of capacitor C₁. As can be, understood by observing Fig. 2, this causes the immediate cut off of transistor T₁, and hence of transistor T₈, with the consequent return of the oscillating circuit CB to neutral position with both transistors T₃ and T₇ cut off and currents I₁ and I₂ of zero value. The audio amplifier A is thus cut off, as is the control circuit associated with it. Upon reopening of the switch 15, that is upon switching on again after stand by, capacitor C₁ begins to recharge and the cycle described for delayed switching on again of the audio amplifier is repeated. Even in case of switching on again after stand by, the transfer of the audio signals to the loudspeaker AP through the audio amplifier A is then delayed for the time necessary for the resettling of the audio signal generator circuits. The control circuit shown in Figs. 1 and 2 is suitable for the case of an audio amplifier with individual power supply. With two power supplies V As shown in Fig. 6 the inverting input F of the audio amplifier is connected to earth through a resistance R₁₂ and the noninverting input of the amplifier is connected directly to the input IN and to earth through a resistance R₁₃. The operational result is shown in Fig. 7, which shows how current I₂ begins to increase at instant T₁ and then reaches operating value at instant T₂. At this point the amplifier A switches on, applying to the loudspeaker AP an ouput voltage V
