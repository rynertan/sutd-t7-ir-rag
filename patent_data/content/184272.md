# Lead delivery mechanism for a mechanical pencil.

## Abstract
A lead delivery mechanism 13 for a mechanical pencil consists of a lead chuck 14 which is designed to grip the lead and which is fitted to the end of a lead pipe 12 , a sleeve 16 abutting a chuck clamping ring 15 loosely fitted to the head portion of the lead chuck 14 , a spring member 19 for clamping the chuck disposed resiliently between the sleeve 16 and the lead pipe 12 , and a locking ring 18 loosely mounted on the lead chuck 14 and engaged by the rear end of the spring member 19 . The locking ring 18 is restrained in the rearward direction by a stepped portion 14a of the lead chuck 14 . As the spring is held captive by the ring 18 the locking mechanism can be handled as a unit in its assembly with the lead pipe 12 .
