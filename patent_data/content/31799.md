# Air agitation device.

## Abstract
The device in question is positioned in between two opposite sets of shelves 3a 3b on which the articles 4 to be dried are placed. The device is constituted by two identical crankshafts 8a 8b, orientated in the same direction, that rotate in synchrony with respect to axes 10 perpendicular to the opposite surfaces 17 of the said sets shelves 3a 3b. To the crankpins 33 of the said shafts 8a 8b are articulated, on opposite sides, two ventilation frames 13 14, each of which provided with a plurality of fins 24 orientated suitably with respect to the said sets of shelves. The synchronous rotation of the crankshafts 8a 8b renders movable each frame, which oscillates with a hormonic motion in two inter perpendicular directions m₁ m₂, one of which is coincident with the longitudinal axis of the passageway 2 existing between the sets of shelves. The longitudinal harmonic oscillation of each frame causes, on the part of this, a flow of air S₁ S₂ directed alternately towards the upper and the lower part of one and the other set of shelves, respectively the contrary occurs for the other frame.
