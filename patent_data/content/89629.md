## Description
Description Plastics cylindrical body The present invention relates to a plastics cylindrical body with a printed pattern formed on the peripheral surface thereof, and, more particularly, to a plastics cylindrical body having a pattern formed by the multicolor printing which exhibits a very attractive halftone. Heretofore, the printed pattern on a plastics cylindrical body has been formed by, almost without exception, the complicated masking process in the case where the pattern is a multicolor one. The reason for this is that i inks of different color are simply printed one over another, the inks mix together and do not show the desired tone of color. In addition, printing for a multicolor pattern has to be performed by masking process for each color, and the desired color has to be prepared previously because the masking process does not permit color mixing.This makes it necessary to provide inks of a great variety of colors. As mentioned above, conventional plastics cylindrical bodies having a multicolor pattern have a disadvantage that the process for printing the multicolor pattern is complicated, a great variety of inks are required, and yet a subtle halftone cannot be made at the boundary between different colors. The present invention has been completed in order to obviate the above mentioned disadvantage involved in conventional plastics cylindrical bodies having a multicolor pattern. The invention will be described into detail with reference to the accompanied drawing illustrating an example. Fig. 1 is a perspective view of an embodiment of the invention. Fig. 2 is a partly enlarged sectional view of an embodiment of the invention. Fig. 3 is a schematic view illustrating the most preferable method for producing the cylindrical body according to the invention. The plastics cylindrical body according to the present invention is made of a synthetic resin such as polystyrene resin, polypropylene resin, and polyethylene resin. The peripheral surface of the thin wall 1 of the plastics cylindrical body is decorated with a pattern 2 which is formed by printed layers 2a, 2b, 2c, ... of ultraviolet curable inks of at least yellow, red, and blue placed one over another. The inks of different color are cured individually by irradiation of ultraviolet rays, and they are placed one over another in the order of the brightness, with the one having the highest brightness being in contact with the peripheral surface of the wall 1. The printed layers 2a, 2b, 2c, ... forming the pattern 2 are placed one over another, and thus it is possible to obtain an attractive halftone by overlapping two or more colors. Since the printed layers 2a , 2b,, 2c , ... are cured individually by irradiation of ultraviolet rays, the ultraviolet curable inks do not mix together prior to curing.This ensures the formation of desired tone of color. The printed layers 2a , 2b , 2c , ... are placed one over another in the order of the brightness, with the one having the highest brightness being in contact with he peripheral surface of the wall 1 . This permits over printing of black letters on the pattern 2 wihtout the need of the conventional complicated masking process . The process for curing individually the printed layers 2a , 2b , 2c , ... of the pattern 2 will be described with reference to Fig. 3, in which the cylindrical body is transferred intermittently along the arrows, with stoppage at stations marked by single circles and double circles.Printing is performed at the stations I indicated by single circles, and irradiation is carried out at the stations K marked by double circles. During the transfer along the line, the cylindrical body is turned in one direction at a constant speed. The cylindrical body put on the line undergoes printing with an ultraviolet curable yellow ink at station I1, and then moves to the next station K1 for curing with irradiation of ultraviolet rays. Thus, the first printed layer 2a of yellow ink is formed. In the same manner, the second printed layer 2b of red ink, the third printed layer 2c of blue ink, and a fourth printed layer 2d of black ink are formed at the subsequent stations, and finally, the pattern 2 is completed. The printing immediately followed by curing prevents inks from mixing together even when inks of different color are put one over another continuously. As mentioned above, the present invention has advantages that overprinting without mixing of inks provides a very attractive halftone and the ink of lowest brightness placed on the outermost layer provides distinct letters or lines without the need of masking process .
