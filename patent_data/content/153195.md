# Frequency modulation apparatus employing a phase locked loop.

## Abstract
An apparatus is provided to frequency modulate FM RF carrier frequencies generated in a phase locked loop 34, 44, 48, 38 . FM outside the loop bandwidth is AC coupled to the loop. FM within the loop bandwidth is DC coupled via an integrating OP AMP 51 to provide phase modulation. When ever the output of the integrator 51 exceeds a preset thresh old, a prescaler 40, 42 removes or adds two pi or integral multiples of two pi radians of phase change from the input to the loop divide by N circuit 44 . At the same time, a current source 54,56 pumps charge into the integrator 51 to exact ly compensate for the amount of phase removed or added, resetting the integrator 51 . DC feedback around the inte grating OP AMP 51 and a feedback signal proportional to the exact amount of phase added or removed provides a true synthesized loop center frequency with no drift. When the feedback path is interrupted, DC FM is provided.
