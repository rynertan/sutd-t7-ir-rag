# Electroerosion recording materials with new hydrophilic protective coating.

## Abstract
Electroerosion recording materials for direct negative and offset master are provided with a surface protective coating of solid conductive lubricant dispersed in a hydrophi lic, cross linked polymeric matrix. The ratio of binder to lubricant particles in said overlayer being sufficient substan tially to prevent flake off during handling and use of said material. The protective films are especially useful where direct offset masters are produced without removal of non eroded lubricant film. The recording medium of this invention provides use as a defect free direct negative and or direct offset master , without requiring the removal of the overlayer prior to use on the printing press. The protective coatings are applied aqueous dispersions of polymerparticulate compositions and thus avoiding the use of organic solvents.
