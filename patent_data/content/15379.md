# Regeneration of rhodium hydroformylation catalysts.

## Abstract
Rhodium hydroformylation catalysts are regenerated by removing deactivated catalyst from the hydroformyla tion reaction, adjusting the aldehyde content of the deac tivated catalyst to have at least one mole of aldehyde pre sent per mole of rhodium and ligand present in the cata lyst, oxidizing the aldehyde containing catalyst at a tem perature below the boiling point of the aldehyde, removing any solid material from the catalyst formed during the oxi dation and adjusting the ligand to rhodium ratio of the ca talyst for use in a hydroformylation reaction.
