# Multiple target seeking clustered munition and system.

## Abstract
A clustered munition in a system for low altitude aerial delivery, which releases multiple rocket powered missiles 20 each having the capability to cruise at a constant al titude and search for a target 22 . Once a target is identified, the missile homes on and strikes the target. In the preferred form, the target seeking means is a radiometric seeker operating in the millimeter wavelength range, in which metal or similarly reflective targets stand out against the background and provide a significant signal which is used to program the terminal action of the missile.
