# Circuit interrupter.

## Abstract
A circuit interrupter comprises a pair of separable contact structures 16, 18 each including a contact element 20, 22 at least one of the contact structures 18 being movable between a closed position and an open position relative to the other contact structure 16 for opening and closing an electric circuit extending through the circuit interrupter. The movable contact structure has an arm support 54 that is pivotable about an axis, a movable contact arm 30 pivotally supported on the arm support and extending in a parallel and an electrically opposite direction to the other contact structure for generating an electromagnetic repul sive force there between, and a biasing means 56 , in particular a double torsion spring, connected between the arm support and the movable contact arm for biasing the movable contact arm to a predetermined position with respect to said arm support. An operating mechanism 24 is connected to the arm support of the movable contact structure for separating the movable contact structure from the stationary contact structure in response to an overcurrent flowing through the circuit interrupter. The movable contact arm 30 has a common pivot axis to the pivot axis of the arm support 54 . Means for controlling the movement of the movable contact arm are described.
