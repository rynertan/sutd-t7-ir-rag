## Abstract
A collecting rope which is intended especially for collecting oil from the surface of water, the rope comprising a drive chain 9 which is situated inside a cylindrical part 3 , which is surrounded by a lightweight float layer 5 , which is surrounded by another cylindrical part 1 , oil collecting bristles 6 being attached to the outer surface of the outer cylinder. The cylindrical parts can rotate in relation to the drive chain 9 , since the joint between them consists of resilient protrusions 11 on the inner surface of the inner cylinder 3 . The cylinders and the chain are, however, locked to each other in the longitudinal direction.
