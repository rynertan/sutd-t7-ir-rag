# Improved acetylene recovery process and apparatus.

## Abstract
Improved process and apparatus is disclosed for the recovery of acetylene from gas containing acetylene and ethylene comprising contacting said gas 11 with acetylene solvent to form a loaded solvent solution 13 heating said loaded solvent solution by passing through a first stream conduit A of a heat exchange zone having a plurality of non interconnecting stream conduits in heat exchange ther mal contact separating the resulting liquid vapor 14 into liquid 16 and vapor 15 phases passing said liquid phase to a second stream conduit 13 of said heat exchange zone passage to a downstream further acetylene separation purifi cation step 17 , and cooling warm denuded acetylene solvent by passage through a third stream conduit C of said heat exchange zone and then further cootlng 22, 23, 24, 18 before passage to said acetylene solvent contacting zone.
