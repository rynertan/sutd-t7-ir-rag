# Channel charge compensation switch with first order process independence.

## Abstract
Channel charge compensation is achieved in a MOS switch comprising two MOSFETs 20, 22 connected in par allel and a compensating MOSFET 24 placed on the semi conductive substrate in precise symmetry with the two switching FETs, each of the FETs being designed to have the same channel charge storing capacity. Accordingly, first order variations in oxide thickness or in gate width across the surface of the semiconductive substrate do not affect the accuracy with which channel charge is compensated in the invention. The compensating FET is switched in com plementary fashion with the two switching FETs so that it absorbs one half of the channel charge expelled from the switching FETs when they are turned off thus preventing this charge from upsetting other components in the circuit such as precision storage capacitors connected to the switch.
