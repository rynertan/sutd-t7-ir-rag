# Radar velocity sensor.

## Abstract
A tracking, variable Q bandpass filtering apparatus is provided for processing an IF signal from a radar transceiver or the like. The apparatus comprises a perid counter 30 for period of each of selected cycles of the IF signal, a low pass developing a digital period signal corresponding to the filter 32 for subjecting the digital period signal to low pass filtering, and a control circuit 34 for controlling the effective corner frequency of the low pass filtering in accordance with the amount of variation in the digital period signal from one selected cycle to a successive selected cycle for producing a filtered signal which substantially follows the digital period signal, thereby substantially simultaneously tracking and filtering the IF signal. The apparatus also includes an output switching control responsive to a predetermined control signal for withholding the filtered signal from an output utilization device. The apparatus also includes a switchable power supply for the radar transceiver and a control circuit responsive to a predetermined control signal for switching the switchable power supply to an inactive condition, thereby removing power from the radar transceiver.
