# Hydra pneumatic load sensor and signal system.

## Abstract
A hydra pneumatic load sensor comprises first bellow means 14 substantially filled with a fluid under a selected pressure having first load plate means 24 associated therewith second bellows means 12 filled with a substan tially incompressible fluid having second load plate means 16 associated therewith signal line means in communica tion with said second bellows means and load transfer means 60 connecting said first and second load plate means. The signal line means is connectable to a signal output means to provide a load sensing signal system.
