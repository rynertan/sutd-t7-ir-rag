# Method of forming a pre fabricated building.

## Abstract
A method of forming a pre fabricated building structure in which a thermally insulating blanket 30 including a moisture impregnable vapour barrier is stretched taut over the structural assembly of rafters 20 and purlins 14 and then panels 16 are mounted over the purlins and secured in a predetermined spatial relationship thereto, using standoff support devices 40 comprising a support member 44 and a plurality of fastener means 42 for attaching the support member to a purlin.
