# A method for forming an electrically conductive polymer film containing silver and the electrically conductive silver polymer composition itself.

## Abstract
A solderable electrically conductive composition comprises metallic silver particles embedded in a matrix formed from acrylic, carboxylated vinyl and epoxy resins and can be formed by dissolving acrylic powder and vinyl powder in respective solvents to form a first solution and a second solution, mixing these solutions with metallic silver particles and an epoxy to form an ink which is applied to a substrate to form a film thereon. The film is heated to evaporate the solvents, and preferably to allow poly merization to occur, thereby leaving the solderable electrically conductive film on the substrate.
