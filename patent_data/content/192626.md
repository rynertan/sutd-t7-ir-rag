## Description
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Malaria is a severe, widespread disease for which, despite years of extensive efforts, a vaccine has not been developed. See, for example, Science, Volume 226, page 679 November 9, 1984 . Experimentally, mammals, including man, have been protected against infection by the etiologic agent of malaria, Plasmodium, by vaccination with irradiated sporozoites. Clyde et al.,Am. J. Trop.Med. Hyg., Volume 24, page 397 1975 andRieckman et al., Bull, WHO, Volume 57 Supp. t , page 261 1979 . Yoshida.et al., Science, Volume 207, page 71 1980 report that such protection is at least partially mediated by antibody directed against a protein on the surface of the sporozoite, the circlmsporozoite CS protein monoclonal antibodies raised against CS proteins neutralize infectivity in vitro and protect animals in vivo. The CS protein appears to be highly evolutionarily conserved within species, but is quite varied across species. Four species of Plasmodium are known to infect man. These are P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovals and p. malariae, the latter two occurring at much lower frequency. Other species of scientific interest are P.berghei and P. knowlesi, the hosts of these species being, respectively, rodents and monkeys. The CS protein of P. knowlesi comprises twelve tandem repeats of a twelve amino acid sequence. Zavala et al., J. Exp. Med., Volume 157, page 1947 1883 , report that the repeat unit is the major immunogen on the P.knowlesi CS protein, based on experiments showing th monoclonal antibodies to the repeat unit blocked access of anti sporozoite antisera to solubilized sporozoite protein. Gysin et al, J. Exp. Med., Volume 160, page 935 1984 , reported that a synthetic 24 residue peptide representing tandem repeat units of the P. knowlesi CS protein neutralized infectivity of virulent sporozoites in monkeys. Colman et al., WO 84 2922 A, published August 2, 1984, report cloning of a portion of the coding region for the P. knowlesi CS protein repeat unit and expression of beta lactamase and beta galactosidase fusions thereof inE. coli. Nussenzweig et al., U.S. 4,466,917, disclose a sporozoite protein referred to as the P44 protein and its cloning and expression in E. coli. Enea et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, Volume 81, page 7520 1984 , report an analogous repeat unit structure within the CS protein of P. cynomologi. Kemp et al., WO.84 029l7 A, disclose cloning and expression of P. falciparum cDNA in E. coli. Dame et al., Science, Volume 225, page 593 1984 , report cloning and expression of the CS protein ofP. falciparum in E. coli. The protein is described as comprising about 412 amino acids with an approximate molecular weight of 44 ,000. It comprises 41 tandem repeats of a tetrapeptide. Synthetic 7 , 11 and 15residue peptides derived from the repeat region bound to monoclonal antibodies raised against the CS protein. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one aspect, the invention is an immunogenic polypeptide capable of conferring immunity in mammals to infection by Plasmodium falciparum comprising four or more tandem repeat units of a Plasmodium falciparum CS protein. In another aspect, the invention is a vaccine for protecting humans against infection by Plasmodium falctparum sporozoitu comprising an immunoprotective amount of the polypeptide of the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF TEE FIGURE Figure la is a partial restriction endonuclease cleavage map of a region of P. falciparum genomic DNA which carries the coding sequence for the CS protein. Figure lb is a partial restriction endonuclease cleavage map of pASl. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The polypeptide of this invention comprises four or more tandem CS protein repeat units produced in E.coli. It is not the CS protein, although it may comprise portions of the CS protein other than the repeat unit.The P. falciparum repeat unit is a tetrapeptide having the following sequence asparagine aqn alanine ala asn prolinefpro . Within the polypeptide of the invention, variation of the tetrapeptide may be present, provided such does not significantly, adversely affect the reactivity of antibodies thereto with the P. falciparum CS protein. For example, as disclosed by Dame et al., Science, Volume 225, page 593 1984 , which is herein incorporated by reference as though fully set forth, of the 41 tetrapeptide repeats in the naturally occurring P. falciparum CS protein, 37 are asn ala asn pro and 4 are asn valine val aspartic acid asp pro. Preferably, more than half of the tetrapeptide repeat units in the polypeptide of the invention are the so called consensus sequence, asn ala asn pro. Preferably, the polypeptide of the invention comprises about 8 repeats, that is 32 amino acids, up to about 148 repeats. More preferably, the polypeptide comprises from about 16 to about 112 repeats. The polypeptide of the invention can be a hybrid, that is, a fusion polypeptide, having non CS protein repeat unit sequences. Such non CS protein repeat sequence can serve as a carrier molecule to enhance immunogenicity or to facilitate cloning and expression in recombinant microorganisms. Alternatively, such additional sequence can carry one or more epitopes for other sporozdite immunogens, other Plasmodium immunogens and or other non Plasmodium immunogens. Specifically excluded from the invention is the CS protein which has been found not to be stabily expressed in practicable amounts in E. coli and not to be necessary for immunization against P. falciparum. Specific embodiments of types of polypeptides of the invention exemplified herein are Rtet32 polypeptides, which comprise at least 4 repeats with about 32 N terminal amino acids from the tetracycline resistance tetR gene in pBR322 fused to theC terminus of the repeats Rtet86 polypeptides, which comprise at least 4 repeats with a tetR gene product fused to the C terminus of the repeats RNS1 polypeptides which comprise at least 4 repeats with the 227 amino acids of NS1 fused to theC terminus of the repeats NS1R polypeptides, which comprise at least 4 repeats with 81 N terminal amino acids of NS1 fused to theN terminus of the repeats RG polypeptides which comprise at least 4 repeats followed by a glycine residue at the C terminus of the repeats RLA polypeptides which comprise at least 4 repeats followed by leucine arginine residues at theC terminus of the repeats and RN polypeptidesi which comprise at least 4 repeats followed by asn thr val ser ser at the C terminus of the repeats. A genetic coding sequence for the CS protein repeat units can be obtained by known techniques. These include synthesis and, preferably, by obtainment from P.falciparum by reverse transcription of messenger RNA as disclosed, for example, by Ellis et al., Nature, Volume 302, page 536 1983 , or by directly cloning the intact gene from P. falciparum genomic DNA as disclosed, for example, by Dame et al., cited previously. The Figure illustrates the CS protein coding region. P. falciparum, and sporozoites thereof, can be obtained from infected humans and mosquitoes. Having cloned the coding sequence for all or part of the CS protein, a sub fragment thereof coding for all or a portion of the repeat unit can be prepared by known techniques. Figure la shows selected available restriction sites within the CS protein gene. Preferred sites are the Xho II sites. Cutting with Xho II releases a coding sequence for 16 repeats as follows N asp pro asn ala asn pro 15 asn val asp pr l C wherein n is one. Use of multiple tandem Xho II fragments in proper orientation results in longer repeats, that is, n is greater than one. Techniques for synthesizing are well known and can be accomplished using commercially available DNA synthesizers. A synthetic. oligonucleotide, having codons for substantially the same amino acids and having the sameXho II ends or different cleavage sites at the ends, can be synthesized. Such synthetic oligonucleotides may vary from the natural 64 codons and may code for the same amino acids or for a polypeptide having a small number, preferably less than about 8, different amino acids, provided these do not significantly adversely affect the immunoprotectiveness of the polypeptide. An exemplary synthetic coding sequence codes entirely for the consensus sequence, asn ala asn pro n wherein n is at least 4. The coding sequence for the polypeptide can be inserted into any E. coli expression vector, many of which are known and available. The high level of expression of the polypeptides of the invention in E. coli is surprising in view of the unusual amino acid composition of the products about 50 asparagine asn , 25 alanine ala and 25 proline pro . As described further below, it has been found that the coding sequence is expressed well using a regulatory element comprising the Pt promoter of lambda and the cII ribosome binding site of lambdat as comprised by the plasmid pASl, described by Rosenberg et alum Meth. Enzvm., Volume 101, page 123 1983 andShatzman et al., in Experimental Manipulation of GeneExpression, edit. by M.Inouye, Academic Press, New York, 1982. pASl carries the pBR322 origin of replication, an ampicillin resistance marker and a series of fragments from lambda, including PL, N antitermination function recognition sites NutL and NutR , the rho dependent transcription termination signal tRi and the cfI ribosome binding site, including the cII translation initiation site, the G residue of which is followed immediately by a Bam El cleavage site. pAsl can be derived from pKC30cII by deleting nucleotides between theBam HI site at the cII pBR322 junction of pKC30cII and the cfI ATG and religating the molecule to regenerate the BamHI site immediately downstream of the ATG. pKC30cII is constructed by inserting a 1.3 kb Rae III fragment from lambda which carries the CII gene into the Spa I site of pKC30. See Shatzman et al., cited above, and Rosenberg et al., cited above. pKC30 is described by Shimitake et al.,Nature, Volume 292, page 128 1981 .It is a pBR322 derivative having a 2.4 kb Hind III Bam HI fragment of lambda inserted between the Hind III and aam HI sites in the tetR gene of pBR322. A construction similar to pASl is described by Courtney et al., Nature, Volume 313, page 149 1985 . ASl was deposited in the American TypeCulture Collection, Rockville, Maryland, under accession number ATCC in accordance with the terms of theBudapest Treaty. The coding sequence is operatively linked, that is, in correct orientation and in proper reading frame, to a regulatory element of an E. coli expression vector by standard techniques to construct an expression vector of the invention. The polypeptide so expressed is isolated and purified from the producing culture by standard protein isolation techniques, many of which are well known in the art An exemplary, useful purification scheme comprises 1 disruption of cells, 2 clarification of cellular debris, 3 separation of the polypeptides of the invention from other polypeptides present in the clarified cell extract and 4 final purification to remove residual contaminants including residual polypeptides, carbohydrates, nucleic acids and or lipopolysaccharides. The first step can be accomplished such as by addition of lysozyme or other lysing or permeabilizing agent or by mechanical or ultrasonic disruption. Prior to centrifugation or filtration to clarify the extract, a surfactant is added to keep the polypeptide of the invention in solution. As one aspect of the present invention, it has been discovered that certain of the polypeptides of the invention can very efficiently be separated from other polypeptides by heating the clarified extract to about 800C following addition of a detergent to maintain solubility of the protein. Heating to 800C for at least about 4 minutes was discovered to cause nearly all bacterial polypeptides to precipitate without denaturing polypeptides comprised substantially of the repeats or of the repeats fused to other non h eat den a tur able sequences. The denatured bacterial polypeptides can be pelleted by centrifugation and removed. This procedure has been used to purify Rtet32 RG, RLA and Rtet86 polypeptides.In particular, this procedure was used to purify successfully R16tet32, R32tet32, R48tet32,R64tet32, R48G, R32LA and R16tet86, as described in the Examples, below, but heating of R16NS1 and R32NS1 resulted in precipitation of these polypeptides. The polypeptide of the invention can be further purified such as by addition of a selective precipitating agent, followed by a final chromatographic step such as ion exchange chromatography or reverse phase HPLC. In the vaccine of the invention, an aqueous solution qf the polypeptide of the invention, preferably buffered at physiological pH, can be used directly. Alternatively the polypeptide, with or without prior lyophilization, can be admixed or adsorbed with any of the various known adjuvants. Such adjuvants include, among others, aluminum hydroxide, muramyl dipeptide and saponins such as Quil A. As a further exemplary alternative, the polypeptide can be encapsulated within microparticles such as liposomes. In yet another exemplary alternative, the polypeptide can be conjugated to an immunostimulating macromolecule, such as killed Bordetella or a tetanus toxoid. Vaccine preparation is generally described in NewTrends and Developments in Vaccines, edited by Voller et al., University Park Press, Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A., 1978. Encapsulation within liposomes is described, for example, by Fullerton, U.S. Patent 4,235,877. Conjugation of proteins to macromolecules is disclosed, for example, by Likhite, U.S. Patent 4,372,945 and by Armor et al.,U.S. Patent 4,474,757. Use of Quil A is disclosed, for example, by Dalsgaard et al., Acta. Vet. Scand., Volume 18, page 349 1977 . The amount of polypeptide present in each vaccine dose is selected as an amount which induces an immunoprotective response without significant, adverse side effects in typical vaccinees. Such amount will vary depending upon which specific polypeptide is employed and whether or not the vaccine is adjuvanted. Generally, it is expected that each dose will comprise 1 1000 ug of polypeptide, preferably 10 200 ug. An optimal amount for a partieular vaccine can be ascertained by standard studies involving observation of antibody titres and other responses in subjects. Following an initial vaccination, subjects will preferably receive a boost In about 4 weeks, followed by repeated boosts every six months for as long as a risk of infection exists. The following Examples are illustrative, and not limiting, of the invention. The CS protein coding sequence was supplied by James Weber, Walter Reed ArmyInstitute for Research, as a 2337 bp Eco RI fragment see, Fig. la of AmPFl Dame et al., cited above in the Eco RI site of pUC8, a standard E. coli cloning vector avaiLable, for example, from Bethesda ResearchLaboratories, Inc.,.Gaithersburg, MD . The resulting pUC8 derivative is referred to as pUC8 clone 1. EXAMPLESExample 1. CS Protein Derivative Purified pUC8 clone 1 plasmid DNA 40 ug was digested with restriction endonucleases StuI and RsaI 100 units of each enzyme in 400 ul of medium buffer 50 mM Tris, pH7.5, 50mM Nail, lmM dithiothreitol DTT , l0mM MgC12 for 1.5 hours at 37CC. The resulting 1216 base pair fragment, encoding all but the first 18 amino acids of the CS protein was isolated by electrophoresis on a 5 polyacrylamide gel PAGE . Expression vector pASl 10 ug was digested with restriction endonuclease Bam HI 25 units in 200 ul medium buffer for 1.5 hours at 370C.The cut p1aid was then treated with DNA polymerase large fragment Klenow, 5 units 20 XM Tris HCl, pH7.5, 7mM MgC12, 60mM NaCl, 6mM 2 mercaptoethanol and 0.25mM of each of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates 25 C, 15 minutes to end fill the Bam HI site. The CS gene fragment 1 ug was then ligated into this vector lOOng in 30 ul ligase buffer 50mM Tris, pH7.5, lmM DTT, lOmMMgCl2, 100 uM rATP with one unit of T4 DNA ligase for 16 hours at 40C.The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli strain MM294CI , and ampicillin resistant colonies were obtained, and screened for insertion of theCS gene fragment into the pASl. A plasmid with the correct construction pCSP was identified and was transformed into E. coli strain N5151 cIts857 and tested for expression of the full length CS protein. The 18 amino acid deletion at the amino terminus of the protein would correspond to a cleaved signal peptide of the authentic CS protein. Cells were grown in Luria BertaniBroth LB at 320C to an absorbance at 650nm A650 of 0.6 and temperature induced at 420C for 2 hours to turn on transcription of the PL promoter of the expression plasmid and subsequent translation of the CS protein derivative.Cells were sampled in 1 ml aliquots, pelleted, resuspended in lysis buffer lOmM Tris HCl, pH7.8, 25 vol vol glycerol, 2 2 mercaptoethanol, 2 sodium dodecyl sulfate SUS , O.1 bromophenyl blue and incubated in a l050C heating block for 5 minutes. Proteins were separated bySDS PAGE 13 acrylamide, 30 0.8 acrylamide bis acrylamide ratio .Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and the CS protein produced in E colt was detected by western blot analysis using a pool of five monoclonal antibodies reactive with the tetrapeptide repeat domain of the P. falciparum CS protein. Dame et al., cited previously. Example 2. R16 te t86 Purified pUC8 clone 1 plasmid DNA 100 ug was digested with restriction endonuclease Xho II 40 units in 400 ul medium buffer at 370C for 16 hours. A 192 base pair fragment encoding 16 tetrapeptide repeats of the CS protein was then isolated by PAGE. Expression vector pASl was cleaved with restriction endonuclease Bam HI as described in Example 1. The 192 base pair Xho II fragment 1 ug was ligated into the Bam HI site of pAsi lOOng as described in Example 1.The ligation mix was transformed into E. coli strain MM294CI . A clone was identified which contained a single 192 base pair Xho II fragment in the correct orientation at the Bam HI site of pASl by polyacrylamie gel electrophoresis analysis of a Bam Hi Hind II fragment of the plasmid, the Hind II site being downstream of the tetR gene and the Bam HI site being at the juncture of the cII ATG and the insert in correctly oriented plasmids. This plasmid pR16tet86 is illustrated as follows pBR322 PL repeat tetR S pBR322 BR B B wherein BH represents a Bara HI site, B represents a Ban II site and S, a termination codon.The pR16tet86 was used to transform E. coli strain N5151 cIts857 and examined for production of the CS protein tetrapeptide repeat by western blot analysis. The protein so produced had the following sequence N met asp pro asn ala asn pro 15 asn val asp pro 1 T86 C wherein T86 was 86 amino acids derived from the tetracycline resistance gene present on pASl. TheN terminal methionine met residue was also derived from the vector, more particularly, from the cII protein initiation codon.Example 2A. R32tet86 and R48tet86 Purified pR16tet86 plasmid DNA 10 ug was digested with 25 units of Bam HI in 200 ul of medium buffer for 2 hours at 370C. One hundred ng of this DNA was then ligated with 1 ug of the 192 base pair Xho II fragment as described above. Plasmid expression vectors, pR32tet86 and pR48tet86, coding for the following polypeptides were prepared and expressed in E. coli. N met asp pr of asn ala asn pro 15 asn val asp pro l nT86C wherein n is 2 R32tet86 or n is 3 R48tet86 . pASl clones wherein n was 2 or 3 were selected from clones in which n was other than 2 or 3, respectively, as described above. All clones examined had the insert in the correct orientation. Both R32tet86 and R48tet86 were expressed at approximately the same levels as Rl6tet86, as estimated by immunoblotting. Immunoblot analysis of several of the Rtet86 proteins revealed a heterogeneous set of products which could not be seen by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R 250 staining. These proteins appeared to have accumulated to roughly half the amounts of the Rtet32 polypeptides, described below. It appeared that the sizes of the smallest degradation products were proportional to the number of tetrapeptide repeats in the clones. The instability of these proteins may be due to degradation of the heterologous COOH terminal tail.Example 3. R16tet32 Purified pR16tet86 DNA 10 ug was cut with 25 units of restriction endonuclease Ban II in 200 ul of medium buffer for 2 hours at 379C. One hundred nanograms of the cut DNA was then ligated closed. This manipulation resulted in the deletion of a 14 base pair Ban II fragment and produced a termination codon just downstream of the remaining Ban II site. The resulting plasmid, pR16tet32, was used to express R16tet32 in E. coli strain N5151 and R16tet32 was purified therefrom.Thirty grams wet weight of E. coli containing R16tet32 were resuspended in 200 ml buffer A 50mM Tris HC1, pH 8.0, 2mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid EDTA , 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 5 vol vol glycerol . Lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mg ml, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 minutes to lyse cells. The mixture was then treated in a Waring blender for 3 minutes at the high setting followed by sonication for one minute with a Branson 350 sonifier to shear bacterial DNA. Sodium deoxycholate was added to a final concentration of 0.1 w v , and this mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at 40C. The suspension was then centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 30 minutes to remove cell debris.The supernatant was collected in a flask, incubated in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes, and centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 30 minutes. It was found that nearly all E. coli proteins precipitated during the heat step and pelleted during the centrifugation, whereas, the R16tet32 protein was soluble and was contained in the supernatant. The supernatant was collected and ammonium sulfate was then slowly added to a final concentration of 20 of saturation. This resulted in selective precipitation of. the R16tet32 protein which was then collected by centrifugation 12,000 x g for 30 minutes . At this point the R16tet32 protein was greater than about 95 pure with respect to other contaminating bacterial proteins. A final chromatographic step e.g., ion exchange, reverse phase high performance liquid chromotography, phenyl sepharose chromatography, size separation, etc. can then be performed to remove residual contamination by other materials such as proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids or lipopolysaccharides. R16tet32 was expressed and purified at levels approximately equal to 5 of totalE. coli protein, that is, about 30 60 rng L, as shown byCoomasie Blue Staining. R16tet32 has the following sequence N met asp pro asn ala asn pro 15 asn val asp pro 1 T32 C wherein n is one and T32 is 32 amino acids derived from the tetracycline resistance gene. More particularly, T32 has the following sequence leu arg arg thr his arg gly arg his his arg arg his arg cys gly cys trp arg leu tyr arg arg h is his arg trp gly arg ser gly ser the remaining Ban II site being between residues 30 and 31.Example 3A. R32tet32, R48tet32 Substantially as described in Example 3, above, R32tet32 and R48tet32, Rl6tet in which n is 2 and 32 3, respectively , were expressed in E. coli and isolated to the same level and degree of purity as R16tet32. The starting vectors were pR32tet86 and pR48tet86, respectively. Example 3B. R64tet32, R80tet32 Purified pR48tet 32 plasmid DNA 10 ug was digested with 25 units of Bam HI in 200 ul of medium buffer for 2 hours at 370C. One hundred nanograms of thisDNA was then ligated with 1 ug of the 192 base pair Xho II fragment as described above. Plasmid expression vectors coding for the following polypeptides were prepared and expressed in E. coli.N met asp pro asn ala asn pro 15 asn val asp pro 1 , T32 C wherein n is 4 R64tet32 or n is 5 R80tet32 . pASl clones wherein n was 4 or 5 were selected from clones in which n was other than 4 or 5, respectively, as described above. Both R64tet and R80tet32 expressed at 32 approximately the same levels as R48tet32.R64tet32 was purified in substantially the same manner as R16tet32,R32tet32 and R48tet32 described above.Example 3C. R96tet32 and R112tet32 Substantially as described in Example 3B, above,R96tet32 and R112tet32 in which n is 6 and 7, respectively , were expressed in E. coli at approximately the same levels as R48tet32. The starting vector was pR8Otet32. Although some heterogeneity in purified Rtet32 polypeptides was observed by immunoblot analysis, the major reactive species correlated with the band seen by protein staining. The observed molecular weights bySDS PAGE were approximately twice that expected, although the migration of each of the proteins was proportional to the number of tetrapeptide repeat units in each of the constructs. Amino acid composition determinations on several Rtet32 polypeptides were consistent with expected values. Example 4. R16G pTerm was prepared by inserting a synthetic linker with the following sequence 5 GATCCCGGGTGACTGACTGA 3 3 GGCCCACTGACTGACTCTAG 5 into the Bam HI site of pASl. pASl 10 ug was digested with 25 units of Bam HI. One hundred ng of the Bam HI cut pASl was ligated with 20 nanograms of the synthetic linker and plasmid pTerm was identified with one linker inserted into the Bam HI site of pASl. This vector retains the BamHI site and results in the insertion of TGA termination codons downstream of the ATG initiation codon of the cII protein in all three reading frames. pR16G was prepared by inserting the 192 base pairXho II fragment from pUC8 clone 1 into the Bam HI site of pTerm and a clone having a single Xho II insert in the proper orientation was selected substantially as described previously. pR16G was cloned and expressed in B. coli strainN5151, substantially as described above. R16G has the following sequence N met asp pro asn ala asn pro 15 asn val asp pro 1 n gly C wherein n is one. Since this protein does not contain any aromatic residues it cannot be visualized by Coomassie BrilliantBlue R 250 staining to quantitate expression levels. By immunoblot analysis with 5 monoclonal antibodies specific for the CS protein Dame et al., cited previously , levels were estimated to be approximately 1 of total cell protein as compared to R16tet32, with which visualization by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R 250 staining is possible.Example 4A. R32G, R48G, R64G, R80G and R112G R32G, R48G, R64G, R80G and R112G R16G in which n is 2, 3, 4, 5 or 7, respectively were expressed in E.coli strain N5151 as described in Example 4, above. These polySSeptides were expressed at about the same level asR16G. R48G was purified substantially as described inExample 3.Example 5. R16LA and R32LA pTerm2 was prepared by inserting a synthetic linker with the following sequence 5 GATCCGCTGCGTT 3 3 GCGACGCAACTAG 5 into the Bam HI site of pASl, substantially as described in Example 4. pTerm2 retains the Bam HI site. The 192 base pair Xho tI fragment from pUC8 clone 1 was inserted as described above. pRl6LA and pR32LA, clones having one or two Xho II inserts in the proper orientation, respectively, were selected substantially as described previously. R32LA was purified substantially as described in Example 3. pR16LA and pR32LA were cloned and expressed in E.coli strain No151, substantially as described previously. Rl6LA and R32LA have the following sequence N met asp pro asn ala asn pro l5tasn val asp pro l n leu arg C wherein n is 1 and 2, respectively. The C terminal leucine and arginine derive from the synthetic linker in pTerm2. The RISLA was expressed as about 1 of total w. coli protein, whereas, R32LA was expressed at approximately 5 of total cell protein.Example 6. R16NS1 pASldeltaEH was prepared by deleting a non essential Eco RI Hind III region of per322 origin from pASl. Ten micrograms of pA5l was cut with Eco RI andHind III 20 units each in 200 ul of medium buffer, treated with DNA polymerase Klenow , ligated closed, and transformed into E. coli, substantially as described above. A clone with the 29 base pair Eco RI Hind III fragment deleted was identified. A 1236 base pair Bam EI fragment of pAPR80l Young et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U.S.A., Volume 80, page 6105 1983 , containing the influenza virus A PR 8 34 NS1 coding region within 861 base pairs of viral origin and 375 base pairs of pBR322 origin, was inserted into the Bam H1 site of pASldeltaEH.The resulting plasmid, pASldeltaEH 801, expresses authentic NS1 230 amino acids . This plasmid retains theBam HI site between the cII translation start site and theNS1 coding sequence. pASldeltaEH SOl 10 ug was cut with Eco RI 20 units and Sal I 20 units in 200 ul of high buffer 50mMTris HC1, pH7.5, lmM DTT, lOmM MgC12, lOOmM NaCl for 2 hours at 37 C, treated with DNA polymerase large fragment Klenow , and ligated closed, substantially as described above. A clone having the 650 base pair Eco RI Sal I region deleted was isolated. This plasmid, pNSldeltaES, expresses authentic NS1. pR16NSl was prepared by inserting a 192 base pair, Xho II fragment from pUCS clone 1 into the Bam HI site in pNSldeltaES and clones having a single Xho II insert in proper orientation were selected substantially as described previously. pR16NSl was cloned and expressed in E. coli, andR16NS1 was purified, substantially as described above, omitting the boiling step. R16NS1 has the following sequence N met asp pr o asn ala asn pro 15 asn val asp pro ii n N227 where n is one and N227 is 227 amino acids of NS1 origin. R16NS1 in the Rl6NSl preparation was estimated to comprise greater than 80 of protein, without the boil or ion exchange step. R16NS1 represented an especially surprising high proportion, approximately 25F, of total cellular protein.Example 6A. R32NS1, R48NS1 and R64NS1 R32NS1 R16NS1 in which n is 2 was expressed in and purified from E. coli, substantially as described inExample 3, above, omitting the boiling step. R32NS1 was expressed at about the same level as R16NS1 and purified to about the same degree. R48NS1 R16NS1 in which n is 3 and R64NS1 Rl6NSl in which n is 4 were expressed in E. coli substantially as described above. R48NS1 and R64NS1 expressed at about 10 and 5 of. total 1S. coli protein, respectively. Example 7. NS1R48 pR48tet86 was cleaved with Bam HI and end filled with DNA polymerase Klenow substantially as described above. The plasmid was then cleaved with Ban II as described above, to release a 672 base pair fragment carrying 3 Xho II fragments and 96 base pairs from the tetraycline resistance gene. Ten micrograms of pASldeltaEEI 801 was cut withNco I 20 units in 200 ul of high buffer for 2 hours at 37 C, and end filled with DNA polymerase large fragment Klenow substantially as described above. The Nco I site is in the codon for residue 81 in NSl. The plasmid was then cut with Ban II, as described above to delete the remaining NS1 codons and a portion of the tetracycline resistance gene, to produce pASldeltaEH 801 l. The 672 base pair, Bam HI end f illed Ban II fragment was inserted into pASldeltaEH 801 l to prepare pNSlR48. This plasmid was expressed in E. coli, substantially as described above. NS1R48 has the following sequence N 81N asp pro asn ala asn pro 15 asn val asp prol n T32 C wherein 81N is 81 N terminal amino acids of NS1, n is 3 and T32 is as described above. NS1R48 was expressed as about 5 of total cellular protein. Example 8. R32N Ten micrograms of pR32NSl was cut with Hind III 25 units in 200 ul of medium buffer for 2 hours at 37 C, and end filled with DNA polymerase substantially as described above, to produce pR32NSl 1. The Hind III site is in the codon for residue 5 in the NS1 coding region. pR32NSl l lOOng was then ligated closed substantially as described above. The resulting plasmid, pR32N, now contained a TAA termination codon after the fifth codon in the NS1 coding sequence. pR32N was used to express R32N in E. coli substantially as described previously. R32N has the following sequence N met asp prof asn ala asn pro 15 asn val asp pro l n N5 C wherein n is 2 and N5 is 5 amino acids derived from theNS1 gene. More particularly, N5 has the following sequence asn thr val ser ser C. R32N was expressed as about 5 of total E. coli protein.Example 9. Antibody Response ELISA Recombinant proteins R16tet321 R32tet32 andR48tet32 were purified substantially as described above, dialyzed against .01 M phosphate buffered saline, pE 7.0 PBS , aliquoted, and stored at 80 C. Constructs were mixed with either PBS, aluminum hydroxide alum orComplete Freund s Adjuvant CFA to yield a 0.5 ml dose containing 50 ug protein. CFA GIBCO, Grand Island, NewYork plus antigen in PBS were emulsified in a 1 1 ratio by agitation for 30 minutes on a mechanical vortexer.Alum was prepared from aluminum hydroxide gel, USP, diluted in PBS. Antigen was absorbed to alum at 40C for 12 hours on a rotary mixer. The suspension was allowed to settle for an additional 12 hours and sufficient supernatant was discarded to yield 0.80 mg Al and 50 ug recombinant protein per dose. Six to eight week old Cm781 6 mice were immunized with a total of 50 ug of protein subcutaneously and intraperitoneally 5 animals per group . Animals were boosted 4 weeks after the primary immunizaton following the same protocol as for the first injections, except that the group which had received the immunogens in CPA were boosted with proteins emulsified in Incomplete Freund s adjuvant IFA .One week later, whole blood obtained by tail bleeding was pooled, clotted overnight at 40C, and centrifuged to separate the serum. These sera were stored at 800C until needed. An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA was used to test all sera for their ability to react with a 16 amino acid synthetic peptide consisting of four repeats of the P. falciparum CS protein asn ala asn pro 4 Dame et al. Science, Volume 225, page 593 1984 . Synthetic peptide antigen was coupled to bovine serum albumin ESA was used to coat the wells of nicrotiter plates. Fifty ul 0.1 ug of the screening antigen diluted with 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, PBS , were pipetted into wells of polystyrene microtitration plates Immunlon 2 Dynatech taboratories, Alexandria, VA and held overnight at room temperature about 220C RT .Well contents were then aspirated, filled with blocking buffer BB 1.0 BSA, 0.5 casein, 0.005 thimersol and 0.0005 phenol red in PBS and held for 1 hour at RT. Mouse sera were diluted serially in BB and 50 ul was added to each well. After a 2 hour incubation at RT, wells were aspirated, washed three times with PBS 0.05 Tween 20 PBS TW20 and 50 ul of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to goat anti mouse IgG H L Bio Rad Laboratories,Richmond, CA diluted 1 500 with 10 heat inactivated human serum in PBS was added to each well.After 1 hour, well contents were aspirated, washed three times withPBS TW20 and 150 ul of substrate 1 mg 2,2 azino di 3 ethyl benzthiazoline sutfonic acid 6 per ml of 0.1 M citrate phosphate buffer, pH 4.0, with 0.0058 hydrogen peroxide added immediately before use was then added to each well. Absorbance at 414 nm was determined 1 hour later with a ELISA plate reader Titertek Multiskan, Flow laboratories, Inc., McLean, VA . The R16tet32, R32tet32 and R48tet32 constructs all resulted in the production of antibody which reacted in theELISA.R16tet32, when administered alone, was poorly immunogenic when compared to R32tet32 and R48tet32.Both alum and CFA enhanced immunogenicity of all three proteins and antibody was detected at titers out to 102,000 in at least one regimen. Example 10. Antibody Response IFA The antisera from Example 9 were shown to react strongly with authentic P. falciparum CS protein which tested in an indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay IFA . Reactivity against P. knowlesi, P. cynomologi, P.viva, and P. gallinaceum was not detected. A slight reactivity of the antisera to R32tet32 was seen with P. berghei. This observation is consistent with previous data by Hockmeyer et al., in Proc. 3d Int l. Symp. Immenobiol. Proteins Peptides, ed. by Atassi, M.Z., PlenumNew York in press showing that some Mabs to P.falciparum react with P. berghei sporozoites by IFA. Sporozoits were dissected from the salivary glands of infected mosquitoes substantially as described by Bosworth, J. Parasitol., Volume 61, page 769 1975 , diluted in saline or Medium 199 GI8COJcontaining 0.5 BSA, counted using a haemacytometer and diluted to 2,000 5,000 sporozoites per 10 ul. Ten ul aliquots were spread onto each well of multi well printed IFA slides, air dried at room temperature and stored at 800C. IFA s were initiated by spreading 20 ul volumes of serum, diluted 1 100 with BE, onto the well of an IFA slide containing dried sporozoites. After a 20 minute incubation in a moist chamber at RT, the serum solutions were aspirated and the spots were washed with 2 drops ofPBS. Twenty ul aliquots of goat anti mouse antibody conjugated to fluocescein isothiocyanate Kirkegard andPerry, Gaithersburg, MD diluted 1 40 with BB were then added to each spot. After a second 20 minute incubation at RT the spots were again washed with 2 drops of PBS, mounted in glycerol and examined under tYV light at 500X magnification for fluorescence.Example 11. CSP Reaction Sera from mice immunized with R16tet32,R32tet32 and R48tet32 produced strong CSP positive reactions Table 1 . When administered without adjuvant, only R16tet32 failed to produce antibody which gave positive CSP reactions, whereas, when given with CPA or alum, all three constructs induced antibodies, which produced strong CSP reactions.Table 1.

Mil. Med.. Volume 134 Supp.1 , page 1183 1969 . Five microliters containing 500 1,000 P. falciparum mosquito salivary gland sporozoites resuspended in Medium 199 were mixed with 5 ul of serum on a microscope slide, sealed under a cover slip rimmed with petroleum jelly and incubated at 370C. for 1 hour. Reactions were evaluated by phase contrast microscopy at 400X magnification. Twenty five random sporozoites were examined for each serum sample and the number of CSP positive organisms are indicated. The degree of CSP reactivity as described by Vanderberg et al., cited above, is shown in parentheses. A indicates no CSP reactivity detectable 2 indicates appearance of a granular precipitate on the surface of the sporozoites 4 indicates appearance of a long, thread like filament at one end of the sporozoites.Normal mouse serum, and serum from mice immunized with CPA alone, produced no detectable CSP reactivity in parrallel assays.Example 12. Hepatocyte Blocking The sera from Example 9, above, were examined in an in vitro inhibition of invasion assay Table 2 . These data show that the RV2tet32 and R48tet32 proteins induce antibodies with strong blocking activity even in the absence of adjuvant. Rl6tet32 was less efficient in eliciting strong blocking antibodies except when administered adsorbed to alum. This finding is consistent with the poor CSP reactivity and low ELISA titers observed with the antisera raised to the R16tet32 protein.Table 2. Inhibition of P. falciparum Sporozoite Invasion HepG2 A16 Hepatoma cells in vitro. Antisera ADJUTANT R16 R32 R48NONE 46 95 92CFA 76 92 94ALUM 100 100 96 Inhibition of spot bozo invasion of cultured cells was performed substantially as previously described by Hollingdale et al. J. rmmunol. Volume 32, page 909 1984 . The sera obtained from mice immunized with theR16tet32, R3 2tet32 and R48tet32 constructs were tested for their ability to inhibit invasion of cultured cells by P. falciparum sporozoites. The sera were diluted in culture medium and added to HepG2 A16 cell cultures to yield a final dilution of 1 20. V V . Cultures then received 12,000 to 40,000 mosquito salivary gland P.falciparum sporozoites and were incubated at 370C in 5 CO2 atmosphere for 3 hours, rinsed wtih Dulbeccols phosphate buffered saline PBS , fixed in methanol, and rinsed 2 times with PBS. Sporozoites that had entered cells were visualized by an immunoperoxidase antibody assay IPA Hollingdale et al., cited above . The IPA was carried out by first treating the fixed cultures with a Mab toP. falciparum 2Fl.l, See, Dame et al., cited above followed by incubation with rabbit anti mouse immunoglobulin conjugated with horseraddish peroxidase and staining with 3r 3 diaminobenzidine. The number of sporozoites that invaded cultured cells was determined by counting the intracellular parasites present in the entire preparation on a Leitz microscope at 250X with a dark blue filter. Experiments were carried out either in duplicate or triplicate and each cell culture within an experiment received an equal number of sporozoites.Inhibition was the percentage reduction of sporozoite invasion by anti construct immune sera compared to normal mouse serum controls where CS reactive Mab 2F1.l gave 100 inhibition of sporozoite invasion at dilutions of 1 20. Recombinant proteins RLA, R16NS1 and R32NS1, prepared substantially as described above, were similarly tested by the ELISA and IFA assays and were shown similarly to induce antibody which reacted with the 16 residue synthetic peptide and to give positive CSP reactions. R32tet32 and R32LA are preferred, because of their relative homogeneity, expression levels, and ease of preparation. Of primary interest in any synthetically produced vaccine, is whether antibody produced against the synthetic immunogen will recognize the authentic molecule and whether the antibody will possess the necessary biological properties to confer protection. The Examples showing both an immunofluorescence assay and the CSP reaction demonstrate that antibody produced against the E.coli constructs reacts with the surface of the sporozoite and thus recognizes authentic CS protein. The presence ofCSP antibody has been shown in animals and man to be an important correlate of protective immunity. The fact that anti construct antibodies inhibit sporozoite invasion of human hepatoma cells in vitro is significant. Hollingdale et al., cited above, showed that both Mabs against P.falciparum and P. vivax as well as polyclonal serum from humans immune to these malaria species blocked sporozoite invasion. Blocking of sporozoite invasion in vitro is thus considered to be an assay for protective antibody.Thus, the data collectively demonstrates that the vaccine of the invasion can be used to protect humans from infection by P. falciparum sporozoites. The immune response to these recombinant proteins as assesse d by ELISA titer, surface reactivity as shown by IFA and CSP and blocking of sporozoite invasion is enhanced by use of either Complete Freunds Adjuvant orAlum. Complete Freunds Adjuvant can not be used in humans since it causes fever, produces granulomas and results in tuberculin hypersensitivity. Alum is currently used as an adjuvant in established vaccines such as diptheria and tetanus toxoid as well as one of the newest vaccines,Heptitis B. It has proven efficacy and a long history of safe use in man. Example 13.
