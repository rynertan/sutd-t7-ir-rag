# Improved lubricating system for organic fluid power plant.

## Abstract
The condensate of a closed cycle power plant that uses an organic working fluid for lubricating the bearings 25 of the turbine 13 is cooled to a temperature below the condenser temperature by an auxiliary cooler 42 before being supplied to the bearings. This subcooling of the lubricating liquid increases its viscosity to a value which causes the minimum thickness of the lubricating film in the bearings to be increased significantly. By increasing the minimum film thickness, the filtering demands on the lubricating con densate are reduced and the surface finish of the journals and bearings is less critical permitting the journals and bearing to be finished by standard precision grinding techniques. In a specific embodiment of the invention, a canister 19 housing the turbine generator 31 is provided with a sump 39 for collecting liquid working fluid which is delivered to the bearings through a cooler 32 Where the prime mover 13 is coupled to a generator 31 through a gearbox 27, 28 all of which are contained in the sealed canister 19 , the viscosity of the condensate may be increased to such a level that the cooled working fluid is adequate to lubricate the gearbox 27, 28 itself.
