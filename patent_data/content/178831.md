## Description
When an aluminium metal substrate is anodized in an electrolyte such as sulphuric acid or phosphoric acid, an anodic oxide film is formed on the surface. This film has a relatively thick porous layer comprising regularly spaced pores extending from the outer surface in towards the metal and a relatively thin non porous barrier layer adjacent the metal oxide interface. As anodizing continues, metal is converted to oxide at the metal oxide interface, and the pores extend further into the film, so that the thickness of the barrier layer remains constant. The cross section and spacing of the pores and the thickness of the barrier layer are all proportional to the anodizing voltage. It is possible to separate the anodic oxide film from the metal substrate by etching away the metal substrate. If the barrier layer is also then removed by dissolution in acid or akali, there remains a porous anodic aluminium oxide film. Such films are useful as filters for example for desalination of salt water, dewatering of whey or for dialysis. Other uses include bacterial filters for cold sterilization, and gas cleaning. DE A 2444541 describes the separation of such anodic oxide films from their metal substrates by the use of aqueous mercuric chloride solution, or bromine solution, or weak hydrochloric acid solution. These all act by dissolving the metal substrate and without substantially affecting the pore structure of the film. The minimum pore diameter is generally determined by the intended use of the film, for example as a filter. The user generally requires a given retention minimum pore diameter coupled with maximum flow rate. Now, flow rate is proportional to the fourth power of the pore diameter, and inversely proportional to the pore length. It is a problem that conventional anodic oxide filters, in which the pores are essentially uniform and parallel, are not well adapted to meet this requirement. If flow rate is to be maximized, the film needs to be thin and fragile while if a stronger thicker film is used, flow rate is reduced. Smith US A 3850762 seeks to reduce pore diameter by heating his film in water to swell the oxide and close the pores. While this technique can certainly reduce pore diameter, it is uncertain, non uniform, and not easily controlled. In the anodic oxide films of the present invention, a system of larger pores extends in from one face and interconnects with a system of smaller pores extending in from the other face. Pore size is determined by the minimum diameters of the smaller pores, while flow rates are determined largely by the length of the smaller pores which can be made very short. The films of this invention thus have a structure substantially different from those disclosed by Smith, and are capable of improved filtering performance compared to those of Smith. The films of this invention may be made by separating an anodic oxide film from an aluminium metal substrate without destroying the substrate. This may be done by immersing the substrate with an adherent anodic oxide film in an electrolyte such as sulphuric acid and anodizing it under a progressively reduced voltage and removing the oxide film from the substrate. A technique of this kind is described in an article by R. W. Thomas in Trans. Inst. Metal Fin., 1976, Thomas gave the following instructions for voltage reduction transfer the anodized specimens to 200 g l sulphuric acid at 23 25 The Thomas voltage reduction technique used alternating current indeed, AC conditions may have been necessary to achieve the chemical dissolution of the barrier layer on which Thomas relied. But a disadvantage of AC is that gas tends to be evolved at the metal substrate surface during the cathodic part of the cycle, and the gas bubbles are likely to cause spalling localized separation from the substrate and pin holing of the oxide film, which of course makes it useless as a filter. The method of the present invention uses DC, or alternatively AC under conditions such that no significant gas evolution takes place on the metal substrate. The Thomas voltage reduction technique was not closely controlled. Applicants have found that close control is necessary, and indeed prefer to use a computer for the purpose. With this control it is possible to obtain an alumina film having a system of larger pores extending in from one face and interconnecting with a system of smaller pores extending in from the other face, and quite different in structure from the films obtained by Thomas technique. This invention provides in one aspect an anodic aluminium oxide film having pores extending from one face of the film to the other, As used herein, nanometer is abbreviated to nm, and This invention provides in another aspect a method suitable for forming such a porous anodic aluminium oxide film which method comprises Reference is directed to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring to Figure 1, an aluminium metal substrate 10 has been anodized in sulphuric acid to generate an oxide film 12. This film has a relatively thick porous layer comprising regularly spaced pores 14 extending from the outer surface 16 in towards the metal and a relatively thin non porous barrier layer 18 adjacent the metal oxide interface 20. Figure 2 shows the position after anodizing has been completed and progressive voltage reduction has started. Although the distance between the outer surface 16 of the film and the metal oxide interface 20 i.e. the film thickness is the same, the barrier layer 18 is thinner. This is because several smaller pores 22 have formed at the inner end of each larger pore 14 and extend towards the metal oxide interface. Figure 3 shows the position after progressive voltage reduction has been completed. Still smaller pores 24 have formed at the inner end of each smaller pore 22, to the extent that the barrier layer has disappeared. The film 12 has separated from the metal substrate 10 and now exists on its own with pores extending from one face right through to the other. A system of larger pores 14 extends in from one face 16 a distance h into the film, these larger pores having a diameter d near their inner ends. A system of smaller pores 22, 24 extends in from the other face 26 a distance s into the film, the smaller pores having a substantially uniform minimum diameter p. Figure 4 shows the relationship between applied voltage and anodizing current. During steady state anodizing both the voltage 28 and the current 30 are steady. A small reduction in the applied voltage, as at 32, leads to a large reduction 34 in the current, presumably because the barrier layer is too thick for anodizing to continue at the lower voltage. After an initial spell 36 at a low level, the current begins to rise at 38. This is the recovery phase, and is presumed to correspond to the thinning of the barrier layer by formation of a system of smaller pores. Later, after recovery has been completed, the current settles at a new level 40, and anodizing continues at the new lower voltage by oxidation of aluminium at the metal oxide interface. It is believed that oxidation does not occur to any great extent during the recovery phase. After a larger voltage drop 42, there is a longer delay 44 before recovery starts. When an aluminium metal surface is anodized using a range of eletrolytes, a porous anodic oxide film is formed. This comprises a non porous barrier layer adjacent the metal, whose thickness is approximately 1nm per volt. The pores have a diameter of approximately 1nm per volt and are spaced apart approximately 2.5nm per volt, these figures being largely independent of electrolyte, temperature and whether AC or DC is used. A voltage reduction is followed by a temporary recovery phase, during which the barrier layer is thinned by the formation of new pores branching out from the bases of the old ones. When the barrier layer has reached a thinner value appropriate to the new voltage, recovery is complete, and anodizing continues by oxidation at the metal alumina interface. Successive voltage reductions lead to successive branching of the pores at their bottom ends. By terminating the voltage reduction at a very low voltage, only an extremely thin barrier layer is left which is readily dissolved causing separation of the film from the metal substrate. The starting aluminium metal substrate is preferably high purity aluminium sheet, for example 99.9 or even 99.99 aluminium. Metal foil could be used, but sheet is preferred because it ensures the absence of pin holes. Lower purity aluminium could be used, but may contain inclusions that affect formation of the desired network of pores where a very fine network is desired. The metal surface may be prepared by chemical polishing, but any other method of providing a smooth surface, e.g. caustic etching, is satisfactory. Ordinary bright rolled sheet may be used. The metal surface is cleaned and degreased and is then ready for anodizing. Anodizing conditions are not critical. Direct current is preferably used, but alternating, pulsed or biased current may be used. An electrolyte is used that gives rise to a porous anodic oxide film, sulphuric, phosphoric, chromic and oxalic acids and mixtures and these being suitable. Although electrolytes are generally acid, it is known to be possible to use alkaline electrolytes such as borax, or even molten salt electrolytes. It is believed to be the simultaneous dissolution film formation mechanism that gives rise to porous films, and this mechanism can operate in an acid or alkaline environment. Anodic oxide films generally contain a proportion, sometimes a substantial proportion up to 15 or more, of anion derived from the anodizing electrolyte. The applied voltage is raised from zero to a level designed to achieve a desired pore diameter and pore spacing as discussed in more detail below and continued for a time to achieve a desired film thickness. For example, using a 0.4M orthophosphoric acid electrolyte at 25 to 30 The anodizing voltage may be chosen to achieve the desired pore spacing. For wide pore spacings high voltages may be used, and we ourselves have used up to 700V. But at these levels it is necessary to use dilute electrolyte, e.g. 0.01 oxalic or phosphoric acid , because the use of electrolyte of conventional concentration e.g. 0.4M phosphoric acid results in dielectric breakdown of the film which prevents further anodizing. The voltage reduction procedure may be carried out in the same electrolyte as that used for anodizing. Alternatively, the electrolyte may be changed either before or during the voltage reduction procedure. Since separation of the film from the substrate depends on chemical and field assisted chemical dissolution of film material, the electrolyte should be chosen to be effective for this purpose. Sulphuric acid and oxalic acid have been successfully used. However, phosphoric acid is preferred for the voltage reduction procedure, particularly the final stages, for two reasons. First, since phosphoric acid exerts a rather powerful solvent effect on alumina, recovery of the anodic film tends to be faster as the voltage is reduced. Second, phosphate inhibits hydration of alumina, which might otherwise occur, either during or more likely after the voltage reduction procedure, with swelling and loss of control over pore size. Where hydration of alumina is desired, e.g. in order to further reduce the pore size, the use of phosphoric acid should be avoided. It may be useful to effect some chemical dissolution of the barrier layer of the film between the anodizing and the voltage reduction steps. This applies particularly when anodizing has been effected at high voltage, e.g. above 200 v. Thereafter the barrier layer may be thinned by chemical dissolution down to a value at which voltage reduction using the chosen electrolyte can be started. During the voltage reduction procedure, the applied voltage is reduced from the anodizing voltage or as noted above from a lower starting voltage down to a value of not more than 15V, preferably not more than 12V. When this reduction is effected by increments, each incremental reduction should be by an amount not more than the greater of 5V and 50 , preferably not more than the greater of 4V and 25 , of the existing voltage. And sufficient time should be allowed for partial or complete recovering of the film between incremental reductions. If the voltage is abruptly reduced by more than the greater of 5V and 50 of the existing voltage, then the likely result is that smaller pores will be formed in the base of only some of the original larger pores, so that many of the larger pores will become blind. In order to avoid any risk of this, voltage reduction is preferably effected by increments of no more than 5 of the existing voltage, or by no more than 0.3V where the existing voltage is less than 6V. The voltage reduction step may be performed using continuous or pulsed DC, or alternatively AC with the extent of cathodic polarization of the metal substrate being limited such that gas evolution does not significantly take place thereon during the cathodic part of the cycle. A biased AC waveform is also contemplated and may be advantageous. Sufficient time is allowed between incremental voltage reductions for partial or complete recovery of the film. It is envisaged that recovery involves penetration of the barrier layer by new pores of a size and spacing appropriate to the reduced voltage, and it is necessary to the method that new pore formation should take place as the voltage is reduced. After recovery is complete, anodizing continues normally by formation of fresh oxide at the metal oxide interface. As this is not desired, a further voltage reduction should be effected either during recovery, or immediately on completion of recovery of the film. Film recovery after an incremental voltage reduction can easily be monitored by detecting the rate of increase of current with time. As shown in Figure 4, this rate of increase reaches a maximum along the line 38 as recovery gets under way, and later falls to zero along the line 40 when recovery is complete. According to a preferred procedure, the maximum rate of increase of current with time is detected, and a further incremental voltage reduction made when the rate of increase of current with time falls to a fraction, generally within the range of 0.01 t 0.9, preferably 0.025 to 0.75, of the maximum. A computer can readily be programmed to control the voltage reduction procedure in this way. The voltage reduction is preferably continued down to a value less than 3V. Separation of the anodic oxide film from the substrate may take place while voltage reduction continues, in which case the separated film is simply recovered. If separation has not occurred, the coated substrate may be held in the electrolyte until separation does take place. Alternatively, the coated substrate may be transferred to a different aqueous medium having solvent effect on alumina, for example phosphoric acid or ammonia or sodium hydroxide. If the voltage reduction procedure is stopped before the minimum voltage has been reached, then the standing time required to achieve film separation is increased. If voltage reduction is stopped above 6V, this standing time is likely to be unacceptably high. Depending on the desired diameter and length of the smaller pores in the oxide film, the film may either be removed from the electrolyte immediately on separation from the metal substrate, or may be left to soak in the electrolyte for a period of time to effect desired chemical dissolution. Voltage reduction may be effected continuously, for example exponentially rather than incrementally. But continuous voltage reduction is difficult to monitor so as to ensure that the desired film recovery is taking place. Continuous voltage reduction is mainly useful when the rate of film recovery is known from previous work. Factors which affect film recovery time and time for separation of the film from the metal substrate include the nature, the concentration, and the temperature of the electrolyte. Faster times are achieved by using electrolytes having greater dissolving power for alumina higher concentrations of electrolyte and higher electrolyte temperatures. It will generally, though not always, be desired to achieve fast times, so as to minimise the inevitable chemical dissolution of the anodic oxide film which takes place all the time. In some cases however it may be preferred to enhance chemical dissolution in relation to pore formation. This may be done by using an electrolyte having greater dissolving power for alumina, or by increasing the electrolyte concentration or temperature, during the voltage reduction step. Or the film may be allowed to remain in the electrolyte after the voltage reduction step has been completed and after separation from the metal substrate has occurred. Combinations of these methods may be used. They can result in films in which the branched pore structure is partly dissolved away, or even wholly dissolved away to leave a film with separate unbranched pores extending all the way through. By these methods, further control can be exercised to the desired end of achieving a film having a predetermined minimum pore size. In general, suitable electrolyte concentrations will fall within the range of 0.1 to 8 mol l and suitable electrolyte temperature within the range of ambient to 95 Even after the anodic oxide film has ceased to be chemically bonded to the metal substrate, surface tension effects may hold it in position. When this stage is reached, the coated substrate can be removed from the electrolyte, thoroughly rinsed, and dried until the film can be just lifted off the substrate. Particularly when a thin anodic oxide film is desired, the whole method, anodizing, voltage reduction and film separation, can be performed continuously. Thick films, of e.g. 50 µm, are self supporting and moderately strong, but thin films may need to be supported on a porous substrate. Reference is directed to Figure 3 of the drawings and particularly to the dimensions indicated thereon. The dimension d is the diameter of the larger pores at their inner ends. It is determined simply by the anodizing voltage, and has a value in nm approximately equal to the applied voltage. The value of d lies in the range of 10nm obtained by anodizing at about 10V up to 1.5 or even 2 µm obtained by anodizing at up to 1000V and widening the pores by chemical dissolution . Values of 0.05 to 0.5 µm are likely to be particularly suitable when the film is intended for use as a filter. The diameters of the larger pores 14 at their outer ends is less important. These diameters may be larger than d by virtue of chemical dissolution. The spacing between the larger pores 14 is generally uniform and approximately 2.5 times in nm the value of d in volts . The dimension h represents the length of the larger pores 14, and is determined simply by the anodizing conditions chosen and the length of time for which anodizing is continued. The value of h may be from 0.1 to 100 µm, or even more, with the proviso that it is preferably greater than d. Films where h has a value in the range 0.5 to 5.0 µm are fragile and require support, but are of value for filters where small pore size has to be combined with high flow through rates. Films in which h is from 30 to 70 µm have the advantage of being self supporting. The dimension p is the diameter of the smallest pores 24. The value of p is determined by the minimum voltage at which significant new pore formation is effected during the voltage reduction procedure. By anodizing at 2V it may be possible to generate pores of diameter 2nm, but some pore enlargement is likely as a result of chemical dissolution, which becomes an increasingly dominant effect in small pores. The value of p is specified at as being less than 0.5d, preferably less than 0.25d, because when the value of p is too close to that d, there is danger of film collapse and degredation. Preferred values of p are in the range 5 to 100nm, depending on the purpose for which the film is to be used. It should be understood that Figure 3 is an idealised representation. It is unlikely that in practice the system of smaller pores 22, 24 would be as uniform or as well characterized as shown. There might be different numbers of smaller pores branching from the base of different larger pores, though there would generally be more than one smaller pore for each larger pore. The three generations of pores 14, 22, 24 illustrated would not be so clearly differentiated in practice. While the minimum pore diameter p is shown as being positioned at one face of the anodic oxide film, this would not necessarily be so in practice. As a result of chemical dissolution, the minimum pore diameter would tend to be a little in from the surface. However, it is an advantage of the films of this invention that the minimum pore diameter is located close to a surface and not deep within the film. The dimension s represents approximately what was the barrier layer in the original anodized film. This dimension may have been reduced by chemical dissolution during or after the voltage reduction procedure or increased by additional anodizing performed during the voltage reduction procedure. To ensure uniform pore size, the value of s should preferably be greater than that of p. However, for optimum flow through characteristics, the value of s should be as small as possible and preferably less than h. The range for s is specified as 10nm to 1.0 µm, preferably 20 to 500nm. The value of s may be reduced as desired by chemical dissolution of the film after the voltage reduction step has been completed and the film separated from the metal substrate. The products of this invention are useful for all purposes for which porous thin films find application. These include use as filters for liquids and gases. For use as filters for liquids, the films of this invention have the following advantages over conventional polymeric asymmetric filters A 99.98 aluminium panel, 5 cm x 5 cm, was chemically brightened and then anodized in 0.25 M oxalic acid at 25 The voltage reduction procedure was started immediately on the completion of anodizing using the same electrolyte. The voltage was stepped down incrementally from the voltage at the end of the anodizing stage to about 0.1.V. The magnitude of each step was the greater of 5 of the existing voltage or 0.3V. Each time the voltage was reduced, the current fell to a very low value and then rose passing through a point of inflexion, i.e. di dt, was at a maximum. When di dt fell to 2.5 of the maximum value, the subsequent voltage step was effected. The voltage reduction procedure took 48 minutes. The sample was then transferred to a 50 by volume H₃PO₄ solution and after 2 to 3 minutes small bubbles were observed at the metal film interface. The sample was removed, well rinsed and dried in an oven. After drying, the film fell from the metal. The fracture section of the membrane was examined using a scanning electron microscope. The film parameters were A specimen similar to that of Example 1 was anodized in 0.4 M H₃PO₄ at 25 For the voltage reduction procedure a suitable programmable power supply was controlled by an HP 9826 computer using an HP 3497A data logger to monitor current and voltage. Certain parameters were preset on the computer Thus the computer stepped down the voltage in increments of the greater of 0.3V or 5 of the existing voltage from the value monitored at the end of anodizing to the first value equal to or less than 0.1V, when the power supply automatically switched off. Each voltage reduction after the first one was controlled by a system involving monitoring the rate of change of current, di dt. Initially when the voltage was reduced, the current fell, so di dt was negative. Subsequently, the current rose, and during this period the computer continually updated in its memory the maximum in di dt, and looked for a value of di dt which was less than or equal to 75 of the maximum. When this condition was satisfied, the computer caused a further voltage reduction. On completion of this procedure, the membrane was detached but not separated from the aluminium substrate. Separation was brought about by immersing the sample of 50 by volume H₃PO₄ at room temperature for about 2 minutes. After rinsing and drying the film was separated from the surface of the metal. A scanning electron microscope examination of the membrane revealed its morphological parameters to be This Example shows the use of high anodizing voltages to generate oxide films having wide pore spacings. Experiments were carried out using solutions of 0.01 wt oxalic acid and 0.01 vol orthophosphoric acid. For investigations above 0 With 0.01 oxalic acid at 25 After anodizing the sample was transferred to 0.4 M phosphoric acid and held at 25 Further experiments using 50 50 vol vol orthophosphoric acid have shown it possible to widen the pores in the centre of the cells up to a value of 400 nm or even greater. A specimen similar to that of Example 1 was anodized in an electrolyte containing 0.4 mol 1 H₃PO₄ and 10 g l oxalic acid at 25 The mixed electrolyte was also used during the voltage reduction process. This was as described in Example 2 except that the maximum percentage di dt was preset at 50 . Separation was also accomplished following the method of Example 2. Subsequently, the separated membrane was immersed in 50 by volume H₃PO₄ at room temperature for 50 min, then rinsed and dried. This procedure substantially removed the system of smaller pores. A scanning electron microscope examination revealed a pore size at the surface where the smaller pores were originally present, of 0.35 µm. More than 95 were clear of any residual bridging material. At the opposite surface the pore size was 0.3 µm.
