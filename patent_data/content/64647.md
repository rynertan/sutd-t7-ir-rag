# Filter media, method for oxidizing and removing soluble iron, method for removing and inactivating microorganisms, and particulate filter aid.

## Abstract
A filter media is provided which comprises an amount of particulate immobilized in a substantially inert porous mat rix. At least a portion of the particulate surface has thereon a divalent metal peroxide. The metal peroxide is magnesium peroxide or calcium peroxide, preferably magnesium perox ide. The filter media is preferably used for oxidizing and removing soluble iron and manganese from an aqueous fluid. The filter may also be used for removing and inactivat ing microorganisms from fluids. e.g. aqueous fluids. Particu late filter aid having coated or adsorbed on the surface the aforementioned metal peroxide may be used as the particu late in the filter media, as well as the metal peroxide in particulate form.
