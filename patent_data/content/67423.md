# Electrochemical cell system with internal reforming.

## Abstract
A fuel cell system 1 provided with a first passage means 11 in communication with and adjacent to a cell diffusion electrode 2 and with a second passage 9 means having a catalyst 13 for reforming hydrocarbons and communicating with the first passage means through a gas porous member 8 . Differential pressure means is further provided to establish a pressure differential between the passage means 9, 11 for promoting reformed gas flow from the second passage means 9 to the first passage means 11 and retarding electrolyte vapor passage from the first passage means 11 to the second passage means 9 .
