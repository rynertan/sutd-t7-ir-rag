# Method of lining or relining tunnels and tunnels lined or relined by such a method.

## Abstract
A method of lining or relining a tunnel 10 , such as a sewer, comprises the steps of deforming a collar 15 for insertion into the tunnel, reforming the collar to locate it in the tunnel 10 , overlapping the edges 12, 13 of a pipe 11 having a single longitudinal split to reduce its cross sectional area for insertion into the tunnel 10, re aligning the edges 12, 13 and expanding the pipe 11 in the tunnel 10 for engage ment with the collar 15 , and securing the edges 12, 13 together to retain the pipe 11 in its expanded form. The edges 12, 13 are secured together by means of an H section elongate jointing member 16 .
