## Description
Feed Utilization Efficiency ImproverThe present invention relates to a feed utilization efficiency improver which comprises lysocellin or a salt or ester thereof as an active ingredient.It has been proposed to improve the growth rate and egg production efficiency of livestock and poultry by adding antibiotic to feeds. However, antibiotics have a common action on humans and animals. The antibiotics remaining and accumulated in the animals are incorporated into the human body together with the meat of the animals whereby resistant bacteria may be formed or other adverse effects may be caused.It is an object of the present invention to provide a feed utilization efficiency improver which does not cause the formation of resistant bacteria or other adverse effects.The foregoing and other objects of the present invention have been attained by providing a feed utilization efficiency improver for livestock and poultry for food which comprises lysocellin or a salt or ester thereof.In the course of various studies of feed utilization efficiency improvers which do not have adverse effects and produce the formation of resistant bacteria it has been found that lysocellin imparts a remarkable improvement in the feed utilization efficiency for livestock, especially ruminants and pigs.Lysocellin is an antibiotic obtained from culture media produced by fermentation of the species Streptomyces cacaoi Waksman Waksman Henrici var. asoensis Isono, Nagatsu and Suzuki K 9 Met strain FERM P 1148 or its mutants, and has the formulaEMI2.1 tysocellin is a polyether type antibiotic and has excellent antibiotic characteristics. It has been found that lysocellin does not have the above mentioned disadvantageous effects. Lysocellin is a commercially available product.Lysocellin was reported in J. Antibiotics No. 2 Viol. 28 pp 118 121 1975 . The sodium salt of lysocellin forms colorless needle like crystals having the following properties Helping point of 158 1600 COptical rotation alpha D25 11.5 c 1, methanol IR Spectrum KBr 3450 3300 cm 1,2960, 2930, 1710, 1590 cm 1 MW 659 C34H59O10Na 1 2H2 Lysocellin is a monocarboxylic acid having a pKa of 6.6 titrated in 66 dimethylformamide .The biological properties of lysocellin are as follows The antimicrobial activities of lysocellin are listed inTable 1. Lysocellin is active against graTn positive bacteria, antibiotic resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and also against some fungi, but it is not active against gram negative bacteria. When Bacillus subtilis was grown on a liquid medium, lysocellin caused bacterial lysis.Lysocellin was inactive against Staphylococcus aureus infection in mice when given by intraperitoneal administration. The LD50 of this antibiotic is about 70 mg kg., given intraperitoneally in mice.

It is possible to add the active ingredient to drinking water or feed. The active ingredient can be also combined with another growth promoter or other antibiotic.The salt of lysocellin used is preferably the sodium or potassium salt. The ester of lysocellin used is preferably a C1 C alkyl ester or benzyl ester of lysocellin.The concentration of the active ingredient employed depends upon the kinds and ages of the animals concerned.In the case of cattle, a feed comprising 0.5 to 200 ppm, preferably 1 to 100 ppm, of the active ingredient is administered. In the case of pigs, a feed comprising 0.5 to 300 ppm, preferably 1 to 200 ppm, of the active ingredient is administered.Lysocellin as the active ingredient has not only a growth promoting effect but also a feed utilization efficiency improving effect, and it also causes fewer accumulation and residual problems in the animal body because of lower intestinal absorption.When the feed utilization efficiency improver of the present invention is fed to ruminants and pigs, the effect is especially remarkable. In general, the mechanism of utilization of a feed by ruminants is to decompose carbohydrates into monosaccharides by microorganisms in the gastric tract and to convert the monosaccharides into pyruvic acid derivatives. The pyruvic acid derivatives are converted into volatile fatty acids such as acetic acid, butyric acid and propionic acid in the fermentation by microorganism. In the rumen of ruminants, the utilization of propionic acid is especially high though acetic acid and butyric acid are also utilized.When lysocellin is administered to ruminants, it is considered that lysocellin accelerates the production of propionic acid in the rumen of ruminants as shown in the following tests, whereby the feed utilization efficiency is remark ably increased. When lysocellin is administered to pigs, especially young pigs, the feed utilization efficiency is remarkably in creased. In general, pigs and especially young pigs, suffer from diarrhea. It is estimated that 60 to 70 of young pigs suffer from diarrhea during the lactation stage to the ablactation stage. When lysocellin is ad ministered to pigs, the diarrhea can be prevented and so the feed utilization efficiency improved as shown in the following test results. The present invention will be further illustrated by examples and tests.
