# Method of producing aspherical elements and products obtained thereby.

## Abstract
A light transmissive glass substrate 2 having a profile 3 which matches in part a desired aspherical profile 4 and having thereon a thin coating of a light transmissive polymeric material which has a minimum thickness 5,5 and 5 , 5 at the matching aspherical part of the glass profile and which increases uniformly in thickness to a maximum, to give a differential thickness which is just sufficient to accommo date the difference between the remainder of the profile of the substrate and the desired profile whereby the glass substrate 2 is first prepared to a second order of profile accuracy when compared with the desired profile by quantity production techniques, such as, casting, machining or grinding, the subs trate is then supported in a mould tool in close proximity to an optically polished surface of a negative profile of the desired aspherical profile and the region between the facing surfaces of the glass substrate and mould filled with the light transmis sive polymeric material.
