IMPROVEMENTS TO FENCING This invention relates to improvements to fencing and to a method of and means for forming a joint between elongate hollow sections. The present invention has been devised to provide fence assembly which will have a neat appearance, which will be reliable and robust in use, and which may be economically and easily erected. This invention also provides a joint formed between elongate hollow sections such as the joint between the rails and posts of a fence assembly formed of hollow elongate members.Other objects and advantages of th invention e11 become apparent from the following description With the foregoing and other objects in view, this invention resides broadly in a method of securing one end of a strut to a wall portion of a hollow member, said method comprising the steps of a forming in said wall an aperture shaped to substantially conform to the cross sectional shape of said one end b inserting said one end through said aperture into said hollow member and c interposing a grommet between said strut and said wall about said aperture, said Oromnet fitting tightly about said one end and having an outer flange portion adapted to overlie the outer edge of said aperture and a circumferential web assembly adapted to pass through said aperture about said one end, and said web assembly supporting thereon a normally extended but retractable pawl m.ember adapted to be retracted by engagement finest said edge as said eb assembly is forced through said aperture to position said pawl member behind said side wall, whereupon said tswl member will move to its normal extended position to overlie said inner edge. This invention also resides in the provision of a fence assembly including a plurality of spaced supporting posts and substantially horizontal struts extending between respective pairs of said spaced posts and each end of each said strut being adapted to be secured to a said post by forming in the side wall of said post an aperture to substantially conform to the crosssectional shape of said end inserting said end through said aperture into said post, and interposing a grommet between said strut and said wall about seid aperture, said grommet fitting tightly about said end and having an outer flange portion adapted to overlie the outer ede of said aperture end a circumferential web assembly adapted to pass through said aperture about said end, and said web assembly supporting thereon a normally extended but retractable pawimember adapted to be retracted by engagement against said edge as said web assembly is forced through said aperture to position said pawl ember behind said side wall, arhereuron said pawl member will move to its normal extended position to overlie said inner edge. This invention resides further in a jointing grommet for the method as set forth above and including an outer flange portion adapted to overlie the outer edge of the aperture in said hollow member no a circutnferential web assembly adanted to pass through said aperture, nd said web assembly supporting thereon a normally extended but retractable pawl member adapted to be retracted by engagement against said ede as said eb assembly is forced through said aperture to position said pawl member behind said side wall, whereupon said pawl member will move to its normally extend position to overlie said inner edge. In order that the invention may be more readily understood and rut into practical effect, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings which illustrate a preferred embodiment of the invention and wherein Fig. 1 is a perspective view of a fence assembly constructed accorcing to the present invention Fig. 2 is an enlarged external view of a rail to post joint Fig. 3 is an internal view corresponding to Fig. 2 Fig. 4 is a perspective view of a jointing grommet according to the present invention Fig. 5 is a side view of the grommet Fig. 6 is a cross sectional view of the grommet taken along the line 6 6 of Fig. 4 Fig. 7 is an enlarged cross sectional view showing the interlocking relationship between the post, grommet and rail and ten along the line 7 7 of Fig. 3, and Fig. 8 is a rierspective view of a preferred form of a iock seamed roll formed meta section for a fence according to the present inventicn. This invention has been devised to provide an attractive fence assembly 10 preferably utilising roll formed metal posts 11 and rails 12, but of course other types of hollow members could be used if desired.In the preferred embodiment, the roll formed components are formed from treated metal sheet such as painted and galvanised sheet sold in Australia under the trade mark COLORBOND , and which may be roll formed without destroying the protective and decorative coloured surface coating applied thereto. As illustrated in Fig. 8, the rail member 12 is roll formed to a rectangular hollow shape having rounded corners 13 and an internal rollformed lock seam 14 arranged in the lower face 15 of the rail 12 which is normally shielded from view. The posts 11 are roll formed in similar manner to a substantially square cross sectional configuraticn and are correspondingly arertured at oprosite sides thereof to receive the ends of the respective rails 12. he apertures 18 in the respective side faces 16 of the posts 11 are pre punched during the roll forming process and are so formed that the ends of the rails 12 may pass freely therethrough leaving a clearance between the post and the rail to enable a flexible grommet 17 to be interposed therebetween to fit tightly within the aperture 18 about the outer face of the rail 12 so as to Drevent wa er tenetration into the intericr of the post 11 nd, t the same time, provi ing an interlocking arrangement RTI ID 5.4 between the respective post 11 and rails 12 5 will hereinafter become apparent, Any number of vertically spaced rails may be provided in the desired ence configuration,and in the illustrated embodiment, three rills equally spaced are provided supported in the uper portion of the post 13. The gate assembly 9 similarly comprises three rails the upper and lower faces of which are mitre jointed with end members to form the gate frame.The gate assembly is hinged at a post by means of a simple pin hinge arrangement as illustrated which includes a pin supporting bracket adapted to be holted or screwed to the fence post. The pin extends into engagement within an aperture in the respective upper and lower rails of the gate. The grommet 17 has n outermost radially extending flange 19 provided with inner and outer deformable sealing fins 20 and 21 respectively which are adapted,in operation, to engage sealably against the outer face of the rails 12 and the side face of the post respectively, to form a weatherproof joint therebetween. This arrangement is clearly shown in Eg. 7. t circumferentially extending integral web assembly 22 extends inwardly from the outermost flange 19 through the g p between the post and rail and the innermost portion 23 thereof which extends about the inner end 25 of the rail 12, provides G support for a plurality of retractable pawl members 24 located in spaced relationship around the web assembly 22.These pawl members 24 re formed integrallywith the innermost portion 23 but the web assembly 2 is cut away at 27 around the protruding end portions 26 of the pawl members 24, whereby the protruding end portions 26 may be forced pivotally inwardly to a retracted position to enable the web assembly 22 to pass through the aperture 18 in the post. When the grommet has been pushed to its fully home attitude around the aperture 18, the pawl members 24 return to their extended attitude at which they extend beyond the inner edge of the aperture 18 so as to prevent retraction of the grommet 17 from the post 11. As shown in Fig. 7, the outermost sealing fins 21 extend rearwardly towards said pawl members 24 and the ports are so made and arranged tt the outermost sealing fin 21 has to be pressed tightly against the side face 16 of the post 11 to enable the pawl members 24 to pass behind the back of the side face 16 and move to their extended position therebehind. Once in this position the pawls will prevent retraction of the grommet so that a sealing pressure is maintained between the sealing fin 21 and side face 16. Similarly, the innermost sealing fin 20 has to be pushed inwards to enable the rail to pass therethrough so that the grommet also seals about the rail 12 to form a weatherproof joint between the rail and post. Furthermore, the inner portion 25 of each rail is providedwith at least one outwardly projecting locking tab 28 which is pressed outwardly from he rai3 a distance sufficient to engage behind he innermost portion 23 to prevent retraction of the rall from the post 11, but not so far out arily to prevent insertion of the rail 12 through the aperture 18 as will become arent. rreferably there are provided prefabricat d concrete footings having sockets therein for supporting the lower ends of the posts 11, and preferably undersize holes are pre drilled for each footing which may be securely embedded in the rail by forcing the footing into he respective undersize hole with the use of a mndrel adapted to be supported temporarily in the post socket provided in the footing. When the footing has been sunkto its operative depth the mandrel.is removed from the socket and the ost is arranged in the footing i its place.If desired the post can be cemented into the footing. After the posts have been erected, the rails are operatively fitted thereto to extend between the posts.For this purpose, the respective grommets for each end of each rail are placed about the rails and move inwardly therealong to enable the rail ends 25 to be inserted one after the other through the respective apertures 18 punched in the rails. This is achieved by allowing the rail ends to move downwardly to the lower edge of the aperture 18whereby the tab 28 may pass beneath the uprer ed, e of the aperture 18. The respective grommets are then moved into operative engagement between the rail and the post whereby the joint is securely locked in place. Once the joint has been made it cannot be disassembled unless the locking tab 28 is bent downwardly to enable the rail to be withdrawn from the post, whereafter the grommet may be removed.For this purpose, the top of the post is provided with a press on capping which may be removed to enable access to the locking tab to be gained when necessary. Of course, the configuration of the grommet as illustrated is applicable only to rectangular sections and it may be varied to suit other sections and used for rurposes other than securing together hollow fence members. The number and nature of the retractable locking tabs may be as desired depending upon the application, and the joint of this invention may be formed between members arr nged at angles other than at ninety degrees. It will of course be realised that the above has been given only by way of illustrative example of a practical embodiment employing the concepts of the present invention and all such modifications and variations thereto as old be apparent to Persons skilled in the art are deemed to fall within the broad scope and ambit of the invention as is defined in the appended claims.
