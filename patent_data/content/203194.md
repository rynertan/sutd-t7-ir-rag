# METHOD OF MANUFACTURING GLASS TUBES FOR W SHAPED AND DOUBLE W SHAPED FLUORESCENT LAMPS.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing glass tubes for W shaped and double W shaped fluorescent discharge tubes. In this method, short, standardized U shaped tubes 1 , 1 are abutted vertically on each other and are fusioned into single unit from the outside by burners 3 , 3 . This eliminates the operation of bending a single elongated glass tube a plural ity of times, enables the practicing of a precise tube bending operation, and reduces the volume of the tube. According to this method, attractive, thin walled tubes can be used without limiting the kind of material thereof. A large diameter discharge tube which can be used instead of an incandescent lamp can also be manufactured easily.

## Description
A PRODUCTION METHOD OF GLASS TUBE OF W AND DOUBLE W TYPE FLUORESCENT LAMPTechnical field The present invention relates to a fluorescent discharge tube of incandescent lamp type which is developed in order to save energy more than ordinary incandescent lamps. The conventional tubes are manufactured in circular type, U type and W type, but on the contrary, the present invention provides a manufacturing method of weld joining a plurality of unit tubes which are prepared in advance. This method makes the manufacturing easier and the tube body smaller, and not only so but this tube is engageable into the conventional incandescent lamp socket. These features contribute to savings of materials, energy and space, and improves aesthetical appearance.Even large capacity tubes with a large diameter can be disposed very densely, while no special glass material is required but any ordinary glasses are utilizable.Technical background There have been conventionally methods of manufacturing glass tubes of W type fluorescent lamps. But the methods were such that the middle portion of a long glass tube was heated to bend it into a U type, and then, the middle points of the two straight portions of the bent tube were heated to bend them into a W type tube. Since such bending work was a difficult process, no precision was atainable, heat energy was much wasted, and a thicker glass tube had to be prepared because the ductility of glass upon heating had to be taken into account. Such special requirements frequently resulted in that a minor defect in the glass material caused ruptures when bending the glass tube. Further, although fluorescent lamps with large diameters show good discharge efficiency, the conventional method was not at all capable of bending such large diameter tubes, and therefore, could not produce fluorescent lamps of W type with high discharge efficiency. This is the factor that in can not replace the high energy consuming incandescent lamps. Moreover, in the conventional methods, the heat bending of glass tube was carried out after the inside wall of the tube was coated with fluorescent substances, and therefore, the fluorescent substances fall off during the heat bending process. Not only so, but the bending of glass tubes close to the adjacent tubes was impossible, and this made the W type tube occupy a larger space, making them impractical for actual use. Further, pairW type lamps were absolutely impossible to manufacture. The above described circumstances made the manufacturers of the field avoid producing W type lamps, and consequently, no good quality products are being supplied because there are difficulties in the mass productivity, characteristics maintaining, and life expectancy.Initiation of invention In the present invention, the production process is such that first a plurality of U type unit tubes are made in advance, and these tubes are joined into W type or pair W type glass tubes through the process of facing contact welding or insert bonding welding. This method makes it possible to save energy and materials, and mass production of products of balanced constitution and dense distribution is made realizable.Brief description of drawings Figures 1 and 2 are respectively a frontal and plan view of the first embodiment of the present invention illustrating the manufacturing method Figures 3 and 4 are exploded perspective views of the second embodi ment of the present invention illustrating the man ufacturing method Figures 4 and 6 are respectively side and plan view of the second embodiment of Figures 3 and 4 illustrating the manu facturing method Figure 7 is a partly sectional view of the third embodiment of the present invention illustrating the manufacturing method.Best practice of the present invention The present invention can be described further in detail below with reference to the attached drawings. Example 1 The U type unit tubes 1, 1 of figures 1 and 2 which are made in advance in a certain size are joined at the joining area 2, 2 vertically, and are heated with a pair of burner 3, 3 . Then they are rotated in order, and the joining areas 2, 2t are melt fixed. After that, air is supplied to smoothen the melt fixed portion, and this completes the manufacturing process of W type or pair W type fluorescent glass tube of the present invention.Example 2 In joining together the U type unit tube 4, 4 with one leg being longer and the U type unit tube 5, 5 with both legs being of even length as shown in figure 3 through 6, the U type unit tubes 4, 4 are made parallelly stood, and on the tips of the unit tubes 4, 4 , the unit tubes 5, 5 are joined by making them inversely stand on the former. Then a heatinsulating plate 6 is provided in the middle of the space between the bent portions of each unit tube. And then the front tips of the U type unit tubes 4, 4 and the rear tips of U type unit tubes 5, 5 are heated by the upper burner 7, while the front tips of U type unit tubes 5, 5 and the rear tips of the U type unit tubes 4, 4 are heated by the lower burner 7 , after having installed the pair of the burner.During this process, the reflected heat from the insulating plate 6 is made to heat the rear tips ofU type unit tubes 4, 4 and 5, 5 , and by moving the burners 7, 7 leftward and rightward as shown in figure 6, the joined portions of the U type unit tubes can be evenly heated and melt fixed without moving the tubes. After this process, air is supplied to smoothen the melt fixed portion, and thereby, W type or pair W type glass tubes of fluorescent lamps are produced.Example 3 A U type unit tube 8 with a larger diameter which is made in advance and with a low melting point is inserted with a U type unit tube 9 with a smaller diameter as shown in figure 7. Between these inserted wall surfaces, adhesive 10 is spread as a preliminary bonding, and this portion is heated to 400 C on its inside and outside, to melt fix the inner and outer tubes 8, 9 at its bonding line 11. Thereby W type or pair W type fluorescent lamps are produced. On the drawings, the reference No 12 indicates filament, 13 chalk, 14 external cap this can be made in the form of sphere , and 15 socket. Possibility of industrial application The present invention as described above does not use the process of bending a glass tube several times, but adopts the method of melt fixing a plurality of a certain regular sized unit tubes in a certain angle, these unit tubes being made in advance and melt fixing being performed at a high temperature or low temperature. Because the process is simple, the products can be easily mass produced, because close bendings and close disposings are possible, an intense lighting is obtained with a small volume lamp. Not only so, but because long and large diameter W type or pair W type fluorescent lamps can be manufactured, the lighting efficiency is improved. This becomes a factor for replacing incandescent lamps, and at the same time, contributes to saving energy. Also because almost any glass material can be used in manufacturing the W type or pair W type fluorescent lamps according to the present invention, the scope of resources utilization is expanded.
