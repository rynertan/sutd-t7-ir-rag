# PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OR REACTIVATION OF METAL CATALYSTS

## Abstract
A process for catalytically converting carbonaceous materials is described using a metal hydrogenation catalyst whose activity is reduced during the catalytic conversion. The reduced activity catalyst is dissolved in a leach solution to form a catalytic metal salt solution. Hydrogen is contacted with the solution so that active catalyst metal is precipitated from the leach solution. The dissolution and reduction steps are continuously effected such that the reduced activity catalyst is continuously converted to an active precipitated metal catalyst. A continuous process for the production of a catalyst mixture of at least two metal catalysts is also described using the same procedure.
