# A sequence controller for a machine tool and a method of preparing and executing sequence program for sequence controller used in machine tool control.

## Abstract
A sequence controller executes sequence control of a machine tool through a sequence program by executing a sub routine program. A function command specifying a subroutine ROT SUB 6 is divided into control condition data RNO, DIR, POS, ACT and operational parameters Number of rotational positionings, present position address etc. . A memory holds the control condition data RNO, DIR, POS, ACT . In response to a command the control condition data is read from the memory to a register. Under control of the subroutine program the control condition data is read from the register and the op erational parameters are read. The result of execution of the subroutine program is stored in the memory and the machine tool is controlled in dependence upon that result. The subroutine program thus includes command RD or RD. STK for reading the control condition data from the regis ter, and operational parameter data. Sequence control involv ing the subroutine program can be represented in a sequence diagram in which a function command for the subroutine is di vided into control conditions RNO, DIR, POS, ACT and pa rameters number of rotational positionings present position address etc. .
