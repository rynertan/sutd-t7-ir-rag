# Cell culture apparatus and method.

## Abstract
Apparatus for the agitated suspension culturing of mammalian cells comprises a flask 10 in which the culture medium and cells 16, 17 are gently agitated by the slow rotation of agitator means 20 suspended downwardly in the culture medium and having at least one flexible sheet 25 with a relatively large surface area which is positioned on the agitator in a manner to allow it to billow like a sail as liquid spills from its trailing edge during rotation of the agitator means.
