## Description
SPECIFICATION 1. TITLE OF THE INVENTION HOT RUNNER MOLD FOR THREE LAYER MOLDING 2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1 Field of the Invention This invention relates to a hot runner mold used when a plurality of synthetic resin molded articles such as preforms or containers of which section has a three layer are obtained by the single operation of injection molding. 2 Description of the Prior Art Where three layer molded articles are formed, generally a nozzle of double construction comprising an inner nozzle and an outer nozzle is used. This double nozzle is used by being directly placed in nozzle touch with a gate of the mold. Resins injected from two nozzles into the mold ar not mixed with each other, and the resin from the inner nczzle is to form an intermediate layer and the resin from the outer nozzle is to form an inner layer and an outer layer. On the other hand, to obtain a plurality of molded articles by the single operation of injection molding, a hot runner mold is used which is provided nozzles brought into nozzle touching with gates of a plurality of cavities of the mold. This hot runner mold is interiorly provided with a hot runner for connecting the gates with the plurality of nozzles whereby the molten resin from the gates is distributed to each of hot runner nozzles via the hot runner. When the aforementioned hot runner mold and the double nozzle are used to injection mold a number of threelayer molded articles, since the distance from the gate of the hot runner mold to each hot runner nozzle is long, layers consisting of two different resins obtained by the injection of the resins into the hot runner mold are in the form of a three layer. Even so, a turbulence occurs in the layers due to the flow resistance or the like before the resins reach the hot runner nozzles. Sometimes the resins become blended thus failing to obtain a three layer molded article in which inner and outer layers and an intermediate layer are clearly defined. In view of the foregoing, an attempt has been made in which a plurality of gates and hot runners are provided in a hot runner block and a double runner nozzle is connected to runners equally branched in the number of nozzles whereby different resins are injected and filled in cavities from an inner nozzle and an outer nozzle of the runner nozzle to form a molded article of a three layer construction. Since the hot runner mold as described above employs the construction in which a hot runner nozzle doubly preassembled is directly mounted on a hot runner mold, there were problems such that a connection between a plurality of branched runners and hot runners becomes complicated, and that resins are easily stayed in the connection portions and as the number of times of molding increases, the resins are excessively heated due to their staying thus giving rise to phenomena such as cracking or carbonization.3. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention has been accomplished in order to solve the problems noted above with respect to prior art.It is an object of the present invention to provide a hot runner mold of a new construction in which even if a hot runner mold is used to obtain a number of articles, a threelayer molded article comprising an inner layer, an outer layer and an intermediate layer may be positively molded. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a hot runner mold of a new construction in which a hot runner nozzle of a double construction can be easily assembled and disassembled, a nozzle and a hot runner can be simply connected without having the resin stayed, and a nozzle can be very easily disassembled for the cleaning of the interior of a hot runner block. It is another object of the present invention to provide a hot runner mold of a new construction in which the manufacturing cost of the mold is low, the resin smoothly flows, and the resin from a gate of a hot runner block to a doubly assembled hot runner nozzle can be distributed smoothly To achieve the aforementioned objects, the present invention provides a hot runner mold which comprises two parallel hot runners formed interiorly of a hot runner block, holes made to cross both the runners and bored in the hot runner block at locations as desired, a nozzle tube mounted in a next hole and having an end thereof projected, and a nozzle cover to cover the end of the nozzle tube to form a hot runner nozzle of a double construction. In the hot runner mold as described above, different resins can be injected into two runners bored in the hot runner block, and these two resins may be guided into a first resin passage in the periphery of the nozzle tube in communication with each runner and a second resin passage within the nozzle tube. In a nozzle portion of a double construction comprising an end and a nozzle member, molten resins from two resin passages may be injected into cavities, and therefore, even if the distance from the gates of both the runners to the cavities is long, blending of the resins does not occur halfway and a number of three layer molded articles may be obtained by the single operation of molding, The present invention will now be described specifically by way of one embodiment shown in the accompanying drawings.4. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS One embodiment of a hot runner mold for three layer molding in accordance with this invention is shown in the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a longitudinal sectional front view of a half portion of an injection mold indicated as the chain line Fig. 2 is a side view of the same and Fig. 3 is a sectional view of a part of the injection mold and end portions of nozzles showing the molding state of a three layer molded article.5. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In the figures, a hot runner block indicated as 1 is interiorly bored with two hot runners 2 and 3 which are located parallel to each other above and below in a longitudinal direction. Central portions of the hot runners 2 and 3 are connected to passages at right angles respectively connected to gates 2a and 3a provided on the side portion of the hot runner block 1. Holes 4 for forming resin passages are equidistantly bored in four places of the hot runner block 1 from the upper surface of a portion near the bottom of the hot runner block 1 so as to cross with the hot runners 2 and 3. A nozzle tube 5 having a nozzle member 5a connected to an end thereof is detachably fitted in each of the holes 4 and 4. This nozzle tube 5 comprises a tube portion 5b formed to have a smaller diameter than that of the hole 4 and a base end portion 5c formed to have the same diameter as that of the hole 4, said base end portion 5c having an opening 5d relative to the hot runner 3. The nozzle tube 5 is forced, from above of the hot runner block I, to a position where the opening 5d and the hot runner 3 register with the base end portion 5c being placed in contact with the bottom surface of the hole, whereby a first resin passage A in communication with the hot runner 2 is formed between the tube portion 5b and a hole wall, and a second resin passage B in communication with the hot runner 3 is formed within the nozzle tube 5.The nozzle member 5a at the end of the nozzle tube 5 is positioned to be projected on the upper surface of the hot runner block 1. A reference numeral 6 denotes a nozzle cap and a nozzle mouth 6a is provided at the end of a cylindrical member having the same internal diameter as that of the hole 4. This nozzle cap 6 is screwed into open end of each of the holes 4, 4 to thereby cover th end portion of the nozzle tube 5 and to provide a communication between the first resin passage a and the nozzle mouth 6a, thus constituting a double hot runner nozzle where the nozzle member 5a at the end of the nozzle tube which forms a nozzle of the second resin passage B is positioned within the nozzle mouth. Thus, the above described hot runner mold is to have four nozzles of a double construction projected from the hot runner block 1. Each of these nozzles is brought into nozzle touch with each cavity gate of an injection mold 7 to obtain a number of three layer molded articles. Fig. 3 shows the molding state. Two different resins poured into the hot runners 2, 3 from the gates 2a, 3b of the hot runner block 1 pass through the first and second resin passages A and B and reach the end 5a and the end of the nozzle cap 6, and they first meet together at the nozzle mouth 6a. Then, in the state where molten resin from the second resin passage B is surrounded by molten resin from the first resin passage A, the resin is poured into the cavity of the mold 7 whereby a three layer molded article 9 wherein the resin from the second resin passage B is present as an intermediate layer b between inner and outer layers a formed by the resin from the first resin passage A can be formed in the periphery of a core 8. In this case, the intermediate layer b can be onesided toward outside or inside by imparting a temperature difference to the injection mold 7 or the core 8. As described above, in the hot runner mold according to the present invention, the nozzle tube 5 is fitted into the hole 4 bored in the hot runner block 1, and the nozzle member 5a projected from the hot runner block of the nozzle tube 5 is covered by the nozzle cap 6 to form the first and second resin passages A and B in communication with two hot runners 2 and 3 present in the hot runner block 1 and to constitute a hot nozzle of a double construction, and therefore, it is possible to very easily perform assembling and disassembling of the double nozzle and cleaning of the resin passages merely by installing and removing the nozzle tube 5 and the nozzle cap 6. In addition, the present invention has the advantages in that since the number of parts is less, the present mold can be manufactured at less cost and a special technique is not required in assembling the nozzle.
