# Silver halide photographic emulsion.

## Abstract
A silver halide photographic emulsion is described, con taining at least one sensitizing dye represented by formula I and at least one compound represented by formula II . The use of compounds of formula I in combination with com pounds of formula II permits the spectral sensitization of photographic emulsions without extending the wavelength region of spectral sensitivity, enabling the production of a light sensitive material of high sensitivity and reduced fog.
