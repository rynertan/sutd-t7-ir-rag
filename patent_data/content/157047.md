# METHOD OF AND DRIVER CIRCUIT FOR CONTROLLING A LASER DIODE

## Abstract
A driver circuit for controlling a laser diode in response to a digital input signal, said driver circuit includes a switch ing circuit 18, 24 for receiving a digital input signal 14 having a high voltage level and a low voltage level, said switching circuit, in operation, generating a switching output comprising a first switching voltage level in response to the high voltage level and a second switching voltage level responsive to the low voltage level. An emitter follower 36 has as its input the switching output for generating an emit ter follower output comprising a first follower output voltage level in response to the first switching voltage level and a second follower output voltage level in response to the second switching voltage leve. A VMOS field effect transis tor 42 has a gate connected to said emitter follower 36 so that, in operation, the voltage level at the gate is substantial ly equal to the voltage level of the output of the emitter follower, and has a source biased to a pre selected source voltage. The VMOS field effect transistor 42 is in operation, enabled whenever the voltage level at the gate is substan tially greater than the source voltage, and disabled when the voltage level at the gate is not substantially greater than the source voltage, one of the first and second follower output voltage levels being substantially greater than the source voltage and the other of said follower output voltage levels being no greater than a voltage level near the source voltage. A laser diode 12 is connected in series with the VMOS field effect transistor for emitting light whenever the VMOS field effect transistor is enabled.
