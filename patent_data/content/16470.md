# Water producing air conditioning system.

## Abstract
A water producing air conditioning system comprises a water producing apparatus 1 which absorbs moisture in the ambient air on an adsorbent or absorbent and evaporates water adsorbed on the adsorbent or absorbent by heating it and condenses steam to obtain water a heat exchanger 2 which heat exchange the ambient air with a hot dry air discharged from said water producing apparatus 1 during adsorbing moisture on the adsorbent or absorbent and an evaporation cooling apparatus 3 for forming a cold wet air by evaporating water and cooling it by contacting water with a dry air at the ambient temperature passed through said heat exchanger 2 . The hot air heated by said heat exchanger 2 or the cold air obtained from said evaporation cooling apparatus 3 is utilized for the air condi tioning. The system can be used for comfortable living in a severe condition as a desert by the effective combination of the evaporation cooling apparatus 3 with the water produc ing apparatus 1 under utilizing heat exchange in high effi ciency.
