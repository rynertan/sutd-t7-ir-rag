# IMPACT SENSOR FOR A PROJECTILE

## Abstract
Impact sensor for a projectile 1 , which comprises a source of power 6 with a normally open circuit 8, 9 and a sensing element 7 , for example a fuse pipe, for the purpose of sensing a closing of the circuit. The circuit con sists of two conductors 8, 9 embedded in a plastic film 10 . A number of edges 13 in the projectile are so arranged as to be capable at the time of the impact by the projectile of penetrating the plastic film and making contact between the conductors.
