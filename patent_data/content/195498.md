As will be noted from the above formula VI for the quatemary ammonium tropane compounds and 3 substituted derivatives thereof of this invention, the present compounds are synthesized by alkylation selectively at the bridghead nitrogen of the starting material compound, examples of which are tropane, tropine, tropentane, tropine benzylate, tropacine and atropine. The R and R substituents may be the same of different, although preferably at least one of the substituents is hydrogen. Most preferably R is hydrogen and R is hydroxyl. Non limiting examples of the compounds of this invention include compounds of methyltropinium, ethyltropinium, propyltropinium, butyltropinium, pentyltropinium, hexyl tropinium, heptyltropinium, octyltropinium, nonyitropinium and decyltropinium. The alkyl substsuent, R, may be linear or branched, with linear preferred. The synthesis method utilized for preparation of the compounds of this invention involves contacting the appropriate starb ng material compound with an alkyiating agent dissolved in a suitable solvent medium at reaction conditions including a temperature of from about ambient to reflux, and a pressure of from 100 to 3549 kPa atmospheric to 500 psig , preferably about tO0 kPa atmospheric . The time required for the reaction will, of course, depend upon such factors as temperature and pressure, as well as relative concentrations of reactants and desired degree of reaction, but usually will be from 6 hours to 4 days.Generally, the reaction mixture will comprise from 5 to 20 weight percent tropane or 3 substituted derivative thereof, from 10 to 20 weight percent alkylating agent and from 60 to 85 weight percent solvent The solvent is preferably polar and is suitably an alcohol of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, an ether of 2 to 10 carbon atoms, or a combination thereof, especially methanol, ethanol, acetone and our diethyl ether. The tropane or 3substituted derivative thereof should be soluble in the solvent chosen to at least about 20 percent The preferred solvent will be essentially water free, as will the reaction mixture in which the present compounds are produced.Choice of solvent will determine to a substantial degree the reflux temperature at which the reaction will proceed to produce the required quatemary ammonium tropane compound or 3 substituted derivative thereof. For example, for an ethanol solvent, the reflux temperature will be about 70 C. whereas for a methanol solvent the reflux temperature will be about 65 C. The alkylating agent may be an olefin such as, for example, ethylene, propylene, butene, decene, formaldehyde, an alkyl halide or an alcohol, provided the alkyl portion thereof has from 1 to 10 carbon atom Numerous other acyclic compounds able to provide at least one reactive C, to C,o alkyl radical may be utilized as alkylating agents. The preferred alkylating agent is alkyl halide of from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, especially the chloride, bromide or iodide, with iodide preferred. When an alkyl halide is used, the halide moiety will of course be the anion of the compound of the invention. Compounds of above formula VI are useful as directing agents in the synthesis of crystalline silicates. Such silicates are useful as catalyst components, sorbents and or ion exchangers. Such silicates are prepared from a reaction mixture containing sources of an alkali or alkaline earth metal oxide, an oxide of aluminum, an oxide of silicon, water and the directing agent compound, as is exemplified hereinafter. Such reaction mixture will have a composition, in terms of mole ratios of oxides, within the following ranges 50 1000SiO2 A1 50 1000H20 SiO2 5 200H2O SiO2 0H Si02 0 2.0 M SiO2 0.01 3.0M SiO2 0 01 2 0RT I Si02 0.01 2.0 wherein R is the cation of the directing agent compound VI and M is the alkali or alkaline earth metal cation. Crystallization of the silicate can be carried out under either static or stirred condition in a suitable reactor vessel, such as for example, polypropylene jars or teflon lined or stainless steel autoclaves. The temperature range for the silicate crystallization is generally from 10000 to 2000C for a time sufficient for crystallization to occur at the temperature used, e.g. from 48 hours to 15 days. Thereafter, the crystals are separated from the liquid and recovered. The reaction mixture can be prepared utilizing materials which supply the appropriate oxides. Such materials may include sodium silicate, silica hydrosol, silica gel, silicic acid, sodium hydroxide, a source of aluminum, and the directing agent compound. It should be realized that the reaction mixture oxides can be supplied by more than one source. The reaction mixture can be prepared either batchwise or continuously.Crystal size and crystallization time of the crystalline silicate material will vary with the nature of the reaction mixture employed and the crystallization conditions. The following examples illustrate the present invention.Examples 1 5 Alkyltropinium halides, i.e., iodides, were prepared by reacting tropine with the appropriate alkyliodide in absolute ethanol according to the reaction VII , where R was individually methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and pentyl. The reaction mixture was generally refluxed for 1 3 days before quenching the reaction vessel in a dry iceacetone bath to 200C. The crystalline product was separated from the solvent and filtered on a Büchner funnel. The crystals were dried in an air stream, then chemically analyzed. Table 1 records the analytical results for the series of alkyltropinium lodides synthesized in these examples.Table 1 Compositions wt.

The pressure was kept constant within about t 0.5mm by addition of adsorbate vapor controlled by a manostat during the adsorption period, which did not exceed about 8 hours.As adsorbate was adsorbed by the silicate absorbant, the decrease in pressure caused the manostat to open a valve which admitted more adsorbate vapor to the chamber to restore the above control pressures. Sorption was complete when the pressure change was not sufficient to activate the manostatThe increase in weight was calculated as the adsorption capacity of the sample in girl 00 g of calcined adsorbant When Alpha Value of the synthesized crystalline silicate is examined, it is noted that the Alpha Value is an approximate indication of the catalytic cracking activity of a catalyst compared to a standard catalyst and gives the relative rate constant rate of normal hexane conversion per volume of catalyst per unit time .It is based on the activity of the highly active silica alumina cracking catalyst taken as an Alpha of 1 Rate Constant 0.016 sex The AlphaTest is described in U.S. Patent 3,354,078 and in TheJoumal of Catalysis, VoL IV, pp. 522 529 August 1965 . It is noted that intrinsic rate constants for many acid catalyzed reactions are proportional to the Alpha Value for a particular crystalline silicate cataiyst, i.e. the rates for toluene disproportionation, xylene isomerization, alkene conversion and methanol conversion see The Active Site of Acidic Aluminosilicate Catalysts, Nature.
