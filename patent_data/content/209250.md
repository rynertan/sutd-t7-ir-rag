# Process for preparing puddings.

## Abstract
A pudding composition particularly adapted to production of a sterile, aseptically packaged pudding product comprising an aqueous admixture of a sugar component, a starch component, a material selected from the group consisting of kappa car rageenan, iota carrageenan and mixtures thereof, and milk sol ids. In the preferred processing, the admixture is heated to elevated temperatures sufficient to sterilize the composition and effect cooking solubilization of the starch, and then cooled to a temperature, preferably from about 70 F to 110 F, suitable for aseptic filling and sealing in suitable containers. The final pack aged pudding product of the invention exhibits stability against microbial contamination and changes in product characteristics, and possesses texture and organoleptic properties similar to and often preferred to those of homemade cooked starch puddings.
