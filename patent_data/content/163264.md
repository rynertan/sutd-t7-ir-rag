# REGION OF INTEREST DIGITAL SUBSTRACTION ANGIOGRAPHY

## Abstract
In digital substraction angiography a low x ray energy temporal substraction image is displayed on a video moni tor. Regions in the temporal image frame that contain motion artifacts are outlined by using a cursor. The coordin ates of the pixels in the defined outlined region are stored in a processor memory. The data for a related hybrid subtrac tion image are developed and stored. The processor then effects substitution of the hybrid subtraction image pixels, that fall within the same defined region, into the temporal subtraction image. The combined image data are transferred to a display controller memory which controls display of the combined image on a monitor. A method and means are provided for automatically determining the optimum value of the weighting coefficient applied to the high energy temporal subtraction image that results in the most complete cancellation of everything in the two images except the contrast medium filled blood vessel when the high and low energy temporal images are subtracted. A method and means are provided for altering the gain and offset of the hybrid image data in such manner as to match the hybrid image contrast and brightness with that of the temporal subtraction image.
