# Constant volt second regulator apparatus.

## Abstract
Voltage regulator apparatus is disclosed which utilizes the stored charge on the intrinsic gate capacitance of a field effect transistor as the means to switch the power in a switch mode voltage regulator in conjunction with a constant volt second regulator, where the stored charge is derived from the timing capacitor.
