# 3 AMINO 5 SUBSTITUTED 2 1H PYRIDINONES AND 3 CYANO COMPOUNDS USEFUL AS CARDIOTONICS AND PREPARATION THEREOF

## Abstract
1 R₁ 3 amino 5 3 R 4 R phenyl 6 R 2 1H pyridi nones or salts thereof, which are useful as cardiotonics, where R₁ is hydrogen, lower alkyl, or lower hydroxyalkyl, R is hydrogen or lower alkyl, and, R and R are each hydrogen, hydroxy or amino at least one of R or R being other than hydrogen, are prepared by reacting the corres ponding 3 carbamyl compound with a reagent capable of converting carbamyl to amino or by first reacting the corresponding 3 carbamyl compound where R and R are each hydrogen, nitro or lower alkoxy with a reagent capable of converting carbamyl to amino and then reacting the resulting 3 amino compound where R and or R are is lower alkoxy and or nitro with a reagent capable of convert ing lower alkoxy to hydroxy and or with a reagent capable of converting nitro to amino. Preparation of the corresponding 3 carbamyl and 3 cyano compounds are described. The invention also concerns the 3 and or 4 methoxy intermedi ates and certain novel 3 cyano analogs. Cyano compounds are also useful as cardiotonics.
