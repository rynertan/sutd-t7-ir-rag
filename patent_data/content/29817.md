# Method and device for loading freight units in a freight container.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method and a device for load ing and unloading cargo pallets of one or a few uniform sizes into a container of predetermined size without subjecting the container floor to heavy loads or damaging its walls or ceil ing. This is achieved with a loading boom 7 which is recip rocably movable in its longitudinal direction and the front end of which can be extended cantilevered into the container 2 without resting on the floor of the same. Pallets 1 can be moved to or removed from a loading station between the container 2 and the loading boom 7 in its retracted posi tion. The front end of the loading boom 7 is provided with lifting means 9 for lifting or lowering the freight unit 1 from or to, respectively, the loading station or the floor 13 of the container 2 . Thus the floor 13 is not subjected to any other load than the weight of the pallets 1 . The lateral and vertical control is exact, thus avoiding damage to the walls and ceiling of the container. The loading and unloading sequences can be automated.

## Description
Method and device for loading freight units in a freight container For simultaneous transport of a multitude of goods it is known to use large freight containers. The volume therein can be used most effectively if the goods are arranged in freight units of one or a few uniform sizes.These freight units can be combined to completely fill the container. Such a method is used, for example, for transporting car body parts between a stamping shop and an assembly plant. Racks are used for this purpose, consisting of a base in the form of a cargo pallet of steel profiles and an upper portion in which the various body parts can be placed The height of the freight unit corresponds to the free, inner height in the container and its length corresponds to the inner width of the containerThe freight units can have various standard widths. Such freight units, when filled with sheet metal parts, are relatively large and of considerable weight, If they are moved with a conventional fork lift truck, for example, which is driven into the container, the floor of the container is subjected to a heavy load for which it is not designed.It has been found that with this method of loading the life of the containers is very short. The purpose of the invention is to make possible loading and unloading of containers with freight units of the above mentioned type without destroying the floor of the container by driving on it. According to the invention this is achieved by a method according to the accompanying claim 1 and with a device according to the accompanying claim 6. Basic to the invention was the insight that rebuilding of the containers or freight units, for example reinforcing the container floor or installation of rollers in the floor or on the pallets, would not be economically feasible because of the large number of containers and the even larger number of freight units. According to the invention, strain on the container floor is avoided completely by having the freight units carried by a boom which can be inserted cantilevered into the container to set down or pick up freight units.In order for the boom to stop at the correct positions for picking up and leaving off freight units, stopping and possible speed reduction of the boom movement is controlled according to a preferred version of the invention, firstly when the boom is advanced with empty carrying means towards a freight unit by sensing the relative position of the carrying means and the freight unit, secondly when the boom with its lifted load is inserted into the container by the load striking a stop in the container or a load set down previously, and thirdly for other boom movements by sensing of the position of the boom in relation to a fixed point.A short space or contact between the freight carrying means and the freight unit can be sensed with the aid of two freight sensing means carried by the boom. These means can also be used to determine whether the freight unit has assumed a predetermined orientation relative to the carrying means and when this is the case, to cause the carrying and lifting means to lift the freight unit. In other boom movements, for example after picking up a freight unit in the container, the boom movement is controlled according to one embodiment of the invention with the aid of interacting boom sensing means both stationary and movable with the boom, which are disposed to read the potion of the boom for triggering starting, stopping, lifting and lowering functions. According to 9ne embodiment of the invention, the boom always has the same always has the same speed when it is moving. According to another embodiment of the invention, the boom can be driven at two different sbeYeds, the higher speed being normally used for long movements, with shifting to the lower speed shortly before the stop position with the aid of special sensing means. For example, in addition to the first mentioned freight sensing means at a short distance in front of the carrying means, the boom can also carry additional freight sensing means at a greater distance from the carrying means. These will then sense the freight unit earlier and can shift the movement of the boom to the lower speed.For the same purpose, the boom sensing means can be doubled with an additional set of sensing means spaced shortly in front of or in back of the sensing means which control the stopping of the boom movement. According to one embodiment of the invention, the freight sensing means arranged at a short distance in front of the carrying means are spaced laterally from each other. When the carrying means approach a freight unit which is oblique in relation to the carrying means, one of the sensing means will give a signal first. The boom movement is thereby stopped and a positioning device, pull in hooks for example, are caused to act on the freight unit so that it is pulled into a parallel position on the carrying means. The correct position is indicated by the two freight sensing means sending signals. The loading boom and the container are in alignment with each other and the freight units are centered on this line on the loading station, thus determining the lateral position of the freight units. The boom performs a purely linear movement without any lateral deviation. A minor lateral deviation of the freight unit is corrected by the carrying and or lifting means automatically centering the freight unit as it approaches the same during the movement of the boom. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, carrying and lifting means take the form of a fork lift attachment mounted on the front end of the boom0When the fork is inserted under the freight unit, the tines of the fork center the same.As an alternative to a fork lift attachment, the boom can be provided with a fixed fork and the lifting movement be accomplished by lifting the entire front end of the boom, for example by making the forward roller support vertically movable. The fork and the freight unit carried thereby would thus automatically be tipped somewhat backward when lifted, thereby achieving more stable carrying of the freight unit and guaranteeing good packing tightness of the freight units in the container. In the case where the lifting device is a fork lift attachment at the front end of the boom it can, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, have guides for the lifting movement of the fork such that the fork is tilted backwards in connection with the lifting movement. The invention will be described below in more detail with the aid of an embodiment, with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which Fig. 1 shows from above and Fig. 2 shows from the side an installation for loading and unloading freight units into and out of a container.Figs0 3 and 4 show from the side and from above a loading boom in the installation, shown in a larger scale. Figs. 5 and 6 show in still larger scales the front end of the loading boom as seen from the side and from above, respectively. The installation is intended for loading and unloading of freight units in the form of cargo pallets 1 with a fixed upper portion which forms a rack for sheet metal parts, for example. The pallets 1 are to be loaded onto or unloaded from a freight container 2 in the form of a large box which is completely closed except at one endwhere there are doors which open. The height of each pallet 1 including the upper portion corresponds to the free inner height in the container 2. The length of each pallet 1, i,e. the greatest dimension in the horizontal plane, corresponds to the inner free width of the container 2. The width of each pallet 1 is one of a small number of predetermined widths so chosen that a given number of pallets arranged in close contact will completely fill the length of the container 2. Fig. 1 shows from above a roller conveyor 3 carrying five pallets 1. The width of each pallet is such that together they fill a container 2, Another roller conveyor 4 is shown at the bottom of Fig. 1, carrying three wider pallets 1. In front of the roller conveyors 3,4 and perpendicular to their longitudinal direction, there is a transport cart 5 which moves on rails 6. A fourth pallet 1 of the same width as those on roller conveyor 4 is shown on the cart 5 in Figs. 1 and 2. The width of these wider pallets 1 is selected so that four pallets completely fill the container 2o The loading installation shown in Figs. 1 and 2 comprises, in addition to the parallel roller conveyors 3 and 4, a loading boom 7 arranged between them which is reciprocably movable parallel to the roller conveyors 3,4 in a fixed boom frame 8o The transport cart 5 can be stopped directly in front of the boom frame 8 in a position which is called the loading station below. On the opposite side of the loading station from the boom frame 8, a freight container 2 is arranged directly in front of the loading boom 7 with its long sides parallel to the same The forward end of the loading boom, as shown to the right in the figure, is provided with a fork lift attachment 9 which is described in more detail below.Fig. 2 shows the fork 10 of the lifting attachment in its lowered position, and as can be seen, the fork lies somewhat higher than the loading plane 11 of the transport cart 5. Said plane 11 is formed of motor driven conveyor rollers not shown in detail here arranged parallel to the conveyor rollers also motordriven of the conveyors 3,4. The container 2 is placed on a floor level 12 such that the interior bottom of the container, indicated by the numeral 13, is at essentially the same level as the loading plane 11 of the cart 5. The bottom 13, the floor 12 and the loading plane 11 are all horizontal. Figs. 3 and 4 show in a larger scale the loading boom 7 and the boom frame 8. The boom 7 is made as a lattice beam which, with the aid of running wheels and guide rails, can move back and forth in the longitudinal direction of the frame 8o At its rear end, at the lefthand end in the drawing, the boom 7 carries on either side two vertically arranged wheel pairs 14. The two wheels in each pair 14 are in contact with the upper and lower sides, respectively, of a guide rail 15 fixed in the frame 8. The rear end of the boom 7 is guided laterally by four wheels 16 arranged two on either side of the boom 7. On either side of the boom the wheels 16 contact from th inside a guide rail 17 fixed in them frame 8.The front end of the boom 7 is supported on either side by a vertical wheel pair 18 fixed in the frame 8, said wheels being in contact with the upper and lower sides, respectively, of a guide rail 19 fixed in the boom. Laterally, the front end of the boom is controlled with the aid of wheels 20 fixed in the frame 8, which are arranged on either side of the boom 7 and contact the outsides of guide rails 21 on the boom.The figures show the boom 7 in its left hand end position, which corresponds to the rear end position of the boom. At the front end of the boom, the tips of their fork 10 just reach the front end of the frame 8. The frame 8 is provided at this location on either side with an additional carrying wheel 22 on which the guide rails 19 can rest when the boom 7 is extended forward. In a corresponding manner, the frame 8 has at its front end on either side a guide wheel 23 arranged to interact with the guide rails 21 when the boom 7 is moved forward. The longitudinal movement of the boom7 is achieved with the aid of a hydraulic motor 24 which is mounted in the frame 8 near its front end. The motor 24 drives a pinion 25 with a vertical axis, said pinion engaging a rack, not shown in detail here, mounted on the inside of the left hand guide rail 21. Figs. 5 and 6 show in a larger scale the front end of the boom 7 with the fork lift attachment 9, as seen from the side and from above, respectively, along the line 6 6 in Fig. 5. The upper and lower longitudinal beams 26 and 27, respectively, of the boom 7 are joined on either side of the boom by means of a vertical post 28 in the form of an angle iron. The upper beams 26 are joined to each other by a transverse box girder 29, and the lower beams 27 are joined to each other by a transverse H beam 30 a short distance behind the posts 28. On their sides facing each other, the posts 28 each carry an upper and a lower guide roller 31,32 with horizontal axes directed transversely across the longitudinal direction of the boom 7o The rollers 31,32 are intended to guide brackets 33,34 arranged at the top and at the bottom of the vertical edges of a rectangular plate 35 arranged vertically transversely between the posts 28.The plate 35 carries the vertical legs 36 of the fork 10.On its rear side the plate 35 carries at the top a central, rearwardly extending bracket 37 which supports a transverse, horizontal shaft 38. A piston rod 39 of a hydraulic cylinder 40 is journalled thereon, the lower end of said cylinder being swingably journalled on a shaft 41 which is carried by an attachment member 42 resting on the H beam 30. Fig0 5 shows the plate 35 and the fork 10 in the bottom position0With the aid of the cylinder 40, the piston rod 39 can be extended upwards thus lifting the plate 35. The guide slots 43 and 44, respectively, in the guide brackets 33 and 34, respectively, run on the rollers 31 and 32, respectively0As can be seen in Fig. 5, the guide slots 43,44 are inclined backwards, the angle of incline a of the upper guide slots 43 is greater than the angle of incline ss of the lower guide slots 44.Thus, when the plate 35 is lifted it will at the same time be tipped backwards so that the lifting fork 10 is also tipped backwards during the lifting movement. The plate 35 is also provided at the bottom of its rear side with two brackets 45 which, when the plate 35 is in its lower position, are in contact with the top of theH beam 30, Laterally the plate 35 with the fork 10 is guided with the aid of rollers 46 arranged, at the top and at the bottom of the laterally directed flanges of the posts 28o Straight edge guides 47, which are fixed to the plate 35 behind the drive brackets 33 and 34, respectively, are in contact with the rollers 46. The installation described above can be used in the following manner. An empty container 2 is placed in the position shown in Fig. 1, By means of the roller conveyor 4 and the motor driven rollers on the transport cart 5, a loaded pallet 1 is moved to the position shown in Fig0 1 on the cart 5. The cart is then moved on the rails 6 to the loading station directly in front of the container 2. The hydraulic motor 24 is filled with pressure oil thus moving the loading boom 7 forward from the position shown in Figs.1 and 2. The fork 10 slips into the space intended for it in the pallet 1. The boom 7 runs out on and is supported by the carrying wheels 22. The boom 7 stops when the fork 10 has been inserted, and the fork 10 is then lifted with the aid of the piston 40. The underside of the pallet 1 will thereby be at a higher level than the bottom 13 of the container 2. The boom 7 is advanced further, with its front portion being cantilevered out over the cart 5 without resting on the same. The pallet 1 is transported in this manner into the container 2 without the pallet 1 or any portion of the boom 7 touching the floor 13, the sides or the ceiling of the container. When the pallet 1 has been inserted to the intended position in the container 2, the boom 7 stops and the pallet 1 is put down on the floor 13.The hydraulic motor 24 is reversed, and the boom 7 is drawn back to the position shown in the drawing. During this time the cart 5 can have returned to the roller conveyor 4 and have been loaded with another pallet 1 which can now be moved forward to the loading station, and the loading sequence with the boom. 7 is then repeated. During its movement between the loading station and the container, the forward portion of the loading boom 7 is cantilevered. At the front of the frame 8, the boom 7 is supported by the heavily dimensioned supporting wheels 22o The rear end of the boom 7 is prevented in this cantilevered position from tipping upward by the lower wheels in the wheel pairs 14 which are in contact with the guide rails 15 from below0 In a preferred embodiment of the loading device, the movements of the boom 7 are controlled automatically for loading and unloading For this purpose the device is provided with boom sensing.means .which sense the position of the boom 7 in relation to the frame 8, and palletsensing means which sense the distance between a pallet 1 and the front end of the boom 7.The boom sensing means comprise a flag 48 at the rear end of the boom 7 on the side, which can be sensed by six sensors 49 54 fixed to the frame, These sensors are arranged in three groups, the rear group of sensors 49,50 being used to stop the boom 7 in its rear end position as shown in the drawings, The middle group of sensors 51,52 is arranged in front of the first group of sensors 49,50 at a distance corresponding to the movement of the boom 7 from the rest position shown up to the loading station, The third group of sensors 53,54 is arranged at the front of the frame and is used to determine the end position of the boom when the container 2 is empty. The boom sensor means also comprise a seventh sensor 55 arranged in front of the sensor 54 9 The sensor 55 is designed to interact with a number of flags 56 arranged on the boom 7 in positions which are determined by the various possible widths of the pallets 1. With the aid of the sensor 55 and the flags 56, the movement of the boom during loading can be slowed when the pallet carried by the boom approaches the position where it is to be placed in the container 2. The pallet sensor means comprise five electro magnetic sensors 57 61 which are carried by the lift fork plate 35 at the front end of the boom 7. The sensors are intended to sense the presence of an iron beam 62, indicated with dash dot lines in Fig, 5, which extends along the long side of each pallet 1. As can be seen from Figs0 5 and 6, a first pallet sensor 57 is mounted on a bracket 63 fixed to the fork plate 35 in such a manner that the sensor 57 lies approximately midway between the horizontal fork tines 10 at a level somewhat below their lifting plane.When the fork 10 is inserted under a pallet, the sensor 57 will send a signal when the beam 62 of the pallet 1 passes over the sensor 57, Two additional sensors 58,59 are carried by the lower guide brackets 34 at the side edges of the fork plate 35, The sensors 58,59 are both at the same distance in front of the fork plate 35, which distance is less than the distance of the sensor 57 from the fork plate 35, The sensors 58,59 also lie under the lifting plane of the fork 10, but somewhat closer to the same than the sensor 57, and are disposed to sense the beam 62 of the pallet. At a still shorter distance in front of the fork plate 35, but still spaced in front of the vertical legs 36 of the fork, there is a horizontal, transverse stop beam 64. The beam 64 extends laterally between the fork legs 36 and is placed at a level somewhat above the lifting plane of the fork 10.The beam 64 is supported by two compression spring members 65, rubber springs for example, elongated in the longitudinal direction of the loading boom 7. The rear ends of the spring 65 are fixed to the fork plate 35 and their front ends support the beam 64 at either end of the same. At either end of the beam there is also fixed an upwardly and rearwardly arranged angle plate 66, the upper horizontal leg of which, in the position shown in Figs. 5 and 6, extends at a level below and rearwards but not in under an associated sensor 60 or 61 fixed to the fork plate 35. When the springs 65 are compressed, the angle plates 66 are pushed in under the sensors 60,61 which then send a signal.This compression of the springs 65 occurs when a pallet 1, abutting against the beam 64, during the forward movement of the loading boom 7 strikes the far end wall of the container 2 or a pallet previously placed in the container 29 The sensors 58,59 can be used to sense whether the pallet under which the fork is inserted is parallel to the fork plate 35 or at an angle thereto. If only one of the sensors 58,59 emits a signal, the pallet 1 is at an angle. It can then be pulled to the correct position by positioning arms carried by the fork plate 35. These arms are made as hooks 67. Each hook 67 is guided between two vertical bracket plates 68 arranged in the longitudinal direction of the loading boom 7. The rear end of the hook 67 is pivotally joined to the piston rod 70 of a hydraulic cylinder 71 via a horizontal, transverse shaft. 69, Between its rear end and its forward end provided with the upwardly directed abutment, each hook 67 is also. provided with a transverse, horizontal guide pin 72. The guide pin 72 and the axially elongated shaft 69 run in guide grooves 73 in the bracket plates 68. The guide grooves extend from their rear ends first horizontally forwards and then inclined downwards and forwards.In the forwardly extended position of the hook 67, the hook is then inclined forwards and downwards so that its upwardly directed abutment lies under the lifting plane of the horizontal fork 10. When the piston rod 70 is pulled into the cylinder 71, the hook 67 is pulled backwards, whereby the guide pin 72 moves up to and into the horizontal portion of the groove 73 so that the upright abutment of the hook will come above the lifting plane of the fork 10 and into contact with the back of the transverse beam 62 of the pallet.As the piston rod 70 is pulled in further it will also pull the beam 62 and the pallet backwards until it is parallel to the fork plate 35 With the beam 62. in contact with the stop beam 64o All of the sensors, both the boom sensors 49 55 and the pallet sensors 57 61, are connected in a way not shown in more detail with an electrical and hydraulic control apparatus 74, which is shown in Fig. 3 arranged beneath the boom frame 8. To the control apparatus 74 there are also connected the hydraulic motor 24 for driving the boom 7, the hydraulic cylinder 40 for lifting the fork plate 35, the hydraulic cylinder 71 for positioning the hooks 67 and a hydraulic pump 75 shown in Fig. 3. Starting from the position shown in Figs. 1 and 2, loading of an empty container 2 proceeds in the following manner.The operator sets the control apparatus 74 for the widths of the freight units 1 which are on the roller conveyor 4 and are to be loaded into the container 2. The operator then starts an automatic process which begins with the transport cart 5, with the pallet 1 resting thereon, being advanced to the loading station directly in front of the loading boom 7, where it stops. The control apparatus 74 now starts the hydraulic motor 24, which advances the loading boom 7 at a relatively high normal speed, The fork 10 is in the lowered position and is inserted under the pallet 1 on the cart 5.The sensor 57 senses the beam 62 of the pallet and in response to this signal the control apparatus 74 shifts the hydraulic motor 24 to a lower speed, so that the boom 7 inches forward. When either of the sensors 58,59 emits a signal, the hydraulic motor 24 and the boom 7 stop, whereafter the hydraulic cylinders 71 are pressurized so that the piston rods 70 are pulled in and the hooks 67 pull the pallet backwards. When both of the sensors 58,59 emit signals, the pallet 1 has assumed the correct position.The control apparatus 74 then supplies pressure medium to the hydraulic cylinder 40, whereby the fork plate 35 is lifted and tilted backwards at the same time, The hydraulic motor 24 is then started again to advance the loading boom 7 at normal speed. The sensor 55 is connected to a pulse coder in the control apparatus 74 and counts the number of flags 56 which pass over the sensor 55. In accordance with the pallet width setting of the control apparatus 74 made by the operator, the boom movement will continue until the appropriate flag 56 causes the sensor to send a signal to the control apparatus 74, whereby the speed is reduced to inching. All this time the loading boom 7 and the forklift attachment 9 are held lifted above the floor of the container. The pallet now approaches the rear, closed end of the container. Finally the pallet strikes the end wall, and its movement is halted. Via the stop beam 64, one or both of the sensors 60,61 is triggered, thus halting the boom 7.The fork is lowered, the positioning hooks 67 are moved forwards so that they release the pallet, whereafter the boom 7 is pulled backwards by reversing the hydraulic motor 24. Even during the return movement with the fork lowered, the boom 7 and the fork lift attachment pass freely over the floor of the container. The boom 7 is now drawn back at normal speed until the sensor 50 senses the flag 48. This causes the control appratus 74 to shift the hydraulic motor 24 to lower speed in reverse so that the boom 7 inches backwards.When the sensor 49 senses the flag 48, the boom 7 is halted, During the loading movement when the boom 7 was inserted into the container 2, the transport cart 5 was moved back to its position in front of the roller conveyor 4 and a new pallet 1 was rolled onto the cart So The cart 5 is now moved with the new pallet up to the loading station, and the loading boom 7 then advances, lifts the new pallet and carries it into the container in the manner described above. The advancing movement of the boom 7 is now slowed down to inching with the aid of a flag 56 located further forward than that used for the first pallet.The second pallet will now not strike the end wall of the container but rather the first pallet which has already been loaded. The result is however the same the rubber springs 65 are compressed so that the sensors 60,61 send a signal to the control appratus 74 which stops the loading boom 7 and sets down the second pallet. By virtue of the fact that it is advanced to abutment with the first pallet, the pallets will stand in close contact without any dead space in the container. The risk of dead space is further reduced by the fact that the pallet, when carried by the fork, is inclined somewhat backwards when it strikes the previously loaded pallet. This prevents forwardly tilting pallets which could be set down at a distance from a previously loaded pallet.After the second pallet has been set down, the boom 7 is retracted to its rear position, and the transport cart 5 advances a third pallet, and the sequence is repeated for this pallet and for the fourth pallet on the conveyor 4. Different flags 56 are used to slow down the boom movement to inching speed just before the lifted pallet strikes the previously loaded pallet. The flags 56 can be placed in such positions that the operator can program the control apparatus 74 for loading the container 2 with pallets 1 of various predetermined widths. It is thus possible to load the container 2 automatically with pallets of the same or different widths0 If desired it is possible with the aid of the loading boom 7 to check that the container 2 is actually empty before the loading sequence is initiated, For this purpose the loading boom 7 is inserted with an empty fork 10 into the container. If there is a pallet in the container, this is sensed by the sensor 57, and it can be lifted out if so desired. If there is no pallet in the container, the flag 48 will pass over the sensor 53, thus making the boom inch forward. The flag 48 then reaches the sensor 54, whereupon the boom 7 is halted and then retracted to its rear end position. Unloading of a loaded container proceeds in the following manner. The operator sets the control apparatus for unloading, whereupon the boom 7 is extended forwards from its rear position at normal speed. The boom 7 passes over the empty loading station, and the fork 10 extends into the container 2. When the sensor 57 senses a pallet 1, the control apparatus 74 shifts the boom movement to inching0When either of the sensors 58,59 senses the beam 62 of the pallet, the boom movement is halted. With the aid of the positioning hooks 67, the pallet is pulled into parallel position, which is indicated by both of the sensors 58,59 giving off signals.The fork 10 can now be lifted, whereafter the boom 7 is pulled backwards out of the container 2O The hooks 67 hold the pallet 1 on the fork 10. When the flag 48 passes over the sensor 52, the control apparatus 74 shifts down the hydraulic motor 24 to inching speed for the boom 7. When the sensor 51 senses the flag 48, the boom 7 stops0 The fork lift attachment 9 is at this point over the loading station where the empty cart 5 now stands. Under the control of the control apparatus 74 the fork 10 is lowered, the positioning hooks 67 are moved forward and released, and the boom 7 is drawn back to its rear position where it is slowed and finally stopped with the aid of sensors 50 and 49, respectively. The cart 5 is now driven to the roller conveyor 3 and the pallet is transferred to the same.Both the cart 5 and its conveyor rollers as well as the roller conveyors 3 and 4 are suitably controlled both for unloading and loading with the aid of the control apparatus 74. When the cart 5 has left the loading station, the boom 7 can again be advanced into the container 2, where the next pallet is sensed by the sensor 57 and a new pick up sequence is carried out analogous with that described above. There has been described above an installation for loading of a special type of covered pallets into an enclosed container. The floor, walls and ceiling of the container can be protected against contact during the loading and unloading processes by the fact that the fork boom can steer the movements of the goods with great precision laterally as well as longitudinally. The installation can also be used for other freight units than those described, for example boxes or conventional pallets with or without shrink film packaged goods. The container can also be one without a roof or. walls, for example an open flat bed. If the container is arranged movable laterally and or vertically during the loading and unloading operations, it is also possible to arrange the freight units beside each other or stacked vertically in the containerThe movements of the container can also be controlled by the control apparatus 74, coordinating them with the movements of the boom 7 and the cart 5.
