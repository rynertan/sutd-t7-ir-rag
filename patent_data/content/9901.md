# Alarm system.

## Abstract
An alarm system includes at least one detecting device 10 which provides an analogue output signal 12 , means 18 to monitor the rate of change of the analogue output signal and provide an alarm signal 50 when the rate of change exceeds a preset limit, and means 20 to compare the analogue output signal to a first reference level 20A and provide a pre maintenance warning signal when the analogue output signal reaches the first reference level. The rate monitoring means 18 comprises a sample and hold circuit 40 , a difference amplifier 42 and a com parator 50 . Circuit 40 holds the signal 12 for a pre determined time and amplifier 42 substracts a predeter mined small voltage 46 . If in the holding time the signal 12 changes by more than voltage 46 , comparator 44 produces signal 50 indicative of the rate of change exceeding the preset limit. Drift of signal 12 to a level 20A indicates the need for maintenance and reaching upper limit 22A or lower limit 24A indicates that detec tor 10 is inoperative.
