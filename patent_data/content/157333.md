## Description
FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a. badge and to a method of making the same.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION U.S. Patent 4,338,737 dated July 13, 1982 to Roger W.Lehmann describes a badge made of a body layer of foam plastic and covered at its front and back faces with a sheet of plastic materialwhichare heat sealed together at their marginal edges.This construction is relatively expensive, since the foam plastic material has first to be cut out to the desired contour.Then the wall sheets have to be cut out to a slightly greater size and then assembled with the body layer and, finally, the resulting assembly subjected to a heat sealing operationOBJECTS OF THE INVENTION The general object of the present invention in to provide a badge and a method of making the same, which is much less expensive than in the above mentioned Patent. Another object of the invention is to provide a badge which has the appeararre df and which imitates, two a certain extent, the standard metal badges with a tapered contour. Another object of the present invention is to provide a badge of very light weight construction and which will resist wear and tear. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The badge of the invention comprises a layer of synthetic foam material of the type having no memory when compressed, an image bearing layer adhering to the front face of said body layer, fastening means carried by the back face of said body layer to attach the body layer to the wearer s clothing, the foam material being exposed all around the peripheral edge of said body layer, the marginal portion of said badge having a smaller thickness than the central portion of said badge.The method of the invention comprises providing a laminate formed of the above noted layers, positioning said laminate on a flat surface and applying a cutting blade against the front surface of said laminate, which not only cuts out the badge from the laminate but also compresses the laminatematerial in the area of the cutting blade. Consequentlu the resulting badge remains with its marginal portion in permanent compressed condition, due to the fact that the foam material used has no memory and will not come back to its original non compressed condition. From the foregoing, it is seen that the badge can be made in one single operation once the various layers of the laminate have been assembled.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 is a perspective view of an example of the badge in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is a side elevation Figure 3 is e side elevation of a badge with a different type of fastening means Figure 4 is an exploded cross sectional view showing the various layers composing one embodiment of the laminate used to make the badge in accordance with the invention Figure 5 is a view similar to that of Figure 4 but showing another embodiment of the laminate Figure 6 is a cross sectional view of the cutting and compressing die used to make the badge of the invention Figure 7 is e plan view of the laminate with the badge cut out Figure 8 is a cross sectional view of the laminate, also taken along line 8 8 of Figure 7 but also showing the compressing and cutting die at the end of its compressing and cutting stroke. In the drawings, like reference characters indicate like elements throughout.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The badge 1 of Figures 1 and 2 is shown in its completed condition ready to be used. It has at its front face 2 a central area 3 delimited by the dotted line 4 and a marginal pottioa 5 outside the dotted line. The edge of the badge is shown at 6. The back face 7 of the badge is flat and, as shown in Figure 2, the marginal portion 5 tapers towards the edge 6, so that the marginal portion 5 has a smaller thickness than that of the central area 3 of the badge 1. Figure 4 shows one embodiment of the laminate to make the badge 1. The laminar consists of a body layer 8, which Is made of a synthetic foam material, indicated at 9, of the type having no memory when compressed so that, once compressed, it stays in this compressed condition. A typical example of such a foam material is expanded polystyrene, preferably such a foam material sandwiched between two paper layers, indicated at 10.Such a body layer may, for instance, have a thickness of two tenths of an iweh. Such a body layer is made by Monsanto Inc. and marketed under the registered trade mark FOME COR. An image bearing layer 11 is adhered to the front face of the body layer 8 and a transparent film 12 is in turn adhered to the image bearlag layer 11. At the back face of the body layer, a sheet of paper l ss or of plastic, coated on both sides with a pressure adhesive, is adhered to the body layer 8 and a pealable protecting film 14 its adhered to the exposed face of the pressure adhesive to complete the laminate. Figure 5 shows an alternative embodiment of the laminate. The same body layer 8 is used, together with the image bearing layer 11 and the protective transparent film 12 at the front face.The image bearing paper is glued onto the paper layer 10 of the body layer 8 by means of liquid glue, indicated at 15. In this embodiment, the sheet of double coated pressure adhesive 13 is replaced by a single layer of pressure adhesive 16 applied in liquid form to the back of the body layer 8. Once the pealable film 14 at the back of the badge is removed, the badge can be adhered to one s clothing by the exposed pressure adhesive of strip 13, or of layer 16. This exposed pressure adhesive constitutes the fastening means for the badge. However, this fastening means can be replaced by a metal safety clip, of conventional con struction, as shown at 17 in Figure 3. The assembled laminate is cut out to form the badge in a single operation. For this purpose the cutting and compressing die, shown in cross section in Figures 6 and 8, is used. This die, generally inaicated at 18, includes a rigid backing block 19, a cutting blade 20 and a layer of compressible material 21. The cutting blade 26 is fixed to and protrudes from one face of the block 19, having an exposed cutting edge 22. This cutting blade 20 normally extends to the top surface of block 19 and is longitudinally shaped in accordance with the desired final contour of the badge 1 to be made.The layer 21 of compressible material is adhered to block 19 on the same face from which the cutting blade 20 protrudes. The layer 21 may be made of rubber and it extends on the outside as well as on the inside of the closed figure formed by the cutting blade 20, with a suitable slot 23 formed in the layer 21 in which the cutting blade freely extends. In its non compressed condition, the layer 21 protrudes at its outer face from the cutting edge 22 of blade 20, as shown in Figure 6. The above described 1aminate of qither Pigtirei or 5 is supported on a flat supporting surface 24, as shown inFigure 8, and the die 18 is pressed against the laminate. The top face of the laminate is engaged by the compressible layer 21 and is pressed in place while the cutting blade 20 cuts through the laminate in accordance with the desired contour of the badge 1. Due to the pressing action of the cutting blade, the foam core 9 of the body layer 8 is compressed on each side of the blade 20, and since this foam 9 has no memory, it remains in compressed condition, therfore defining the compressed marginal portion 5 of the finished badge 1. After the die cutting operation, the badge is already in its completed condition, with the foam layer 8. being exposed at the edge 6 of the badge. However, since the badge has a much reduced thickness at its marginal portion, the exposed foam is hardly visible and will not detract from the general appearance of the badge. Obviously, several badges can be cut out simultaneously from a single sheet of laminate, with the images properly spaced at the top face of the laminate, in which case the die would include several cutting blades 20 adapted to register with the respective images.
