## Description
AN IMPROVED CABLE SUPPORT SYSTEM This invention relates to electric cable and or service pipe supports in which protection is provided against the effects of external fires. According to the invention an improved electric cable and or seryice pipe support comprises metal means for supporting at least one electric cable and or at least one service pipe an elongate metal duct housing said support means and divided transversely of its length into at least two separately formed parts that are detachably secured together, at least one of said separately formed parts having at spaced positions along its length, for cooling purposes, a ventilation hole or ventilation holes for passage of air into or out of the duct and, mounted in the duct, means for closing said ventilation holes automatically when the temperature outside the duct reaches or exceeds a predetermined value. The predetermined temperature near the outer surface of the duct at which the ventilation hole closure means will automatically operate can be arranged to ensure transversely of the duct and towards said wall to close the ventilation holes, In the latter arrangement, air entering the duct through ventilation holes will flow between adjacent closure plates and around the electric cables and or service pipes but, for improved air circulation in the duct, preferably each closure plate itself has a plurality of apertures which are not in direct alignment with the associated ventilation holes and which, when the closure plate is automatically operated to close the ventilation holes, will themselves be closed by the wall of the duct. Any convenient form of mechanism may be used to hold the closure plate in the open position and, when automatically operated, to move it into the closed position but, preferably, when the closure plate has been moved into the closed position, e.g. by a spring or springs, the arrangement is such that the closure plate is locked in this position, e.g. by a toggle mechanism, by a cam or by a lever following a specially shaped slot.One simple form of toggle mechanism that may be employed to lock the closure plate in the closed position is at least one lever which b at one of its ends is pivoted above the closure plate and which, at the other of its ends, bears against the closure plate, the lever being so spring loaded that it is urged towards a position in which it will lie with its axis substantially normal to the that in the event of an external fire the maximum safe temperature that the sheath of an electric cable and or a service pipe can withstand will not be exceeded, closing of the ventilation holes preventing the ingress into the duct of flames or hot gas. Preferably, the electric cable and or service pipe support has a plurality of separately operable ventilation hole closure devices arranged at spaced positions along the length of the duct, each adapted to close a group of ventilation holes. Each ventilation hole closure device preferably comprises a substantially flat plate or sheet, preferably a metal plate or sheet having a layer or coating of thermal insulating material and or heat absorbing material, the closure device being normally supported in such a position with respect to the ventilation holes it is arranged to close that air can flow into and out of the duct but which, when automatically operated, moves with respect to the duct in such a direction and to such an extent as to close said ventilation holes. The closure plate may be arranged to move lengthwise with respect to the duct to close the ven tilation holes but, with a view to reducing the risk that efficient operation of the ventilation hole closure device may be prevented by distortion of the duct under external fire conditions, preferably the closure plate is spaced from the wall of the duct in which the ventilation holes are present, and when automatically operated, is moved In all cases, each ventilation hole may be of any suitable shape, for example a circular hole or a rectangular slot. To provide further protection against the eifects of external fire at least one periorated pipe or other elongate perforated chamber may be housed in the duct for the purpose of introducing a non flannnable cooling fluid, e.g. water, into the duct on to the internal surface of the duct walls and or on to electric cables and or service pipes supported in the duct. Alternatively, or additionally, at least part of the length of the duct may be lined with a continuous wall of thermal insulating material and or thermal absorbing material, provided that the ventilation holes are not obstructed and that the efficiency of operaton of the ventilation hole closure devices is not reduced. One form of such lining may be built up ouija plurality of separate containers shaped to fit against the walls of the duct and containing water or other non flammable cooling fluid. Such containers may be closed flexible envelopes or metal enclosures preferably housing closed it exile envelopes. The invention will be further illustrated by a description, by way of example, of three preferred forms of cable support with reference to the acFompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a fragmental side view of the first form of cable support with the operating mechanism of the closure plates omitted Figure 2 is a transverse cross sectional view of the cable support taken on the line II II in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a plan view of a closure plate Figure 4 is a side view of the operating mechanism of a closure plate Figure 5 is a fragmental view of the release device of the operating mechanism when in the open position during automatic actuation Figure 6 is a fragmental side view of the operating mechanism of a closure plate of a second form of cable support, and Figure 7 is a transverse cross sectional view of the third form of cable support. Referring to the drawings, the first form of electric cable and or service pipe support shown inFigures 1 to 5 comprises an elongate metal duct 1 comprising a part 3 of substantially channel shaped cross section, a. separately formed cover 6 and, extending transversely of the duct at spaced positions along its length, a plurality of elongate metal members 2 on which electric cables C can be supported. The bottom wall 5 of the channel shaped part 3 has, at spaced positions along its length, ventilation holes 11. At each of a plurality of spaced positions along the length of the duct 1 is a closure plate 4 made partly of thermal insulating material which is supported from transversely extending members 2 by a spring loaded toggle mechanism 8 Figure 4 . The toggle mechanism 8 is pivotally connected to the centre of a metal framework 7 which is secured to the upper surface of the closure plate 4 and which transmits the centrally applied force to the four corners of the plate, the arrangement being such that the plate 4 is urged towards the bottom wall 5 by the spring of the toggle mechanism. The plate 4 has apertures 12 for flow of air, the apertures not being in direct alignment with the associated ventilation holes 11. Movement of the closure plate 4 is normally prevented by a release device 10 Figures 4 and 5 which comprises two sheet metal components rigidly held together by solder which melts at a temperature of about 700C, the release device being positioned so that shoulders 13 at each side of the device, rest on the bottom wall 5 on diametrically opposite sides of one of the ventilation holes 11 and an upper part of the device supports the closure plate to prevent it moving to the closed position until the solder melts. A lower part of the release device 10 projects through the hole 11 so that it will sense the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere. To ensure quick response to external heat, the sheet metal components of the release device 10 may be of high conductivity metal, e.g. copper. Holes may be included in the components to facilitate soldering or the use of solder or plugs or rivets of plastics material. In order to provide satisfactory bearing surfaces, the shoulders 13 of the release device 10 which rest on the bottom wall 5 and the part of the release device on which the closure plate 4 is supported may be thickened or flanged. In the event of an external fire of such intensity that the temperature outside the duct rises to above the predetermined value of 700C, the solder rigidly holding together the components of the release device 10 melts, the components are ejected through the ventilation hole 11 Figure 5 under the action of the spring of the toggle mechanism 8 and the closure plate 4 is moved into the closed position to close the ventilation holes 11, the closure plate being locked in the closed position by the toggle mechanism, which has previously been suitably adjusted by means of the screw 9. The second form of cable support is substantially identical to the cable support shown in Figures 1 to 5 except for the operating mechanism of each closure plate and, in Figure 6 where component parts are identical to those of the cable support shown in Figures 1 to 5, the same numerical references have been employed. Referring to Figure 6, a closure plate 24 is supported above and spaced from the bottom wall 5 of the duct by release devices 10 so that, in normal use, air can flow through the ventilation holes 11 to cool the interior of the duct. Urging the closure plate 24 downwardly towards the bottom wall 5 are pairs of spring loaded levers 26, 27 which are pivoted from a member 21 supported from transversely extending members not shown and whose lower ends are curved and bear against raised lands 25 on the closure plate. The springs not shown of the levers 26, 27 are of such a form and are so mounted as to urge the levers towards a position in which they lie with their axes normal to the plane of the closure plate. In the event of an external fire of an intensity sufficient to melt the solder rigidly holding together the components of the release devices 10 the components are ejected through the ventilation holes 11 as shown in the Figure under the action of the spring loaded pivoted levers 26, 27, pivotal movement of the levers beyond the position at which their axes lie normal to the plane of the closure plate being prevented by stops 28 depending from the member 21. As will be seen, lever 27 of each pair is slightly longer than lever 26 or it could be of the same length but with its pivotal axis closer to the closure plate than that of lever 26 so that it continues to urge the closure plate towards the bottom wall 5 after the lever 26 has reached its full limit of pivotal movement and is holding the closure plate against the bottom wall.This provides a closing force on the closure plate should some distortion of the bottom wall 5 of the duct have taken place due to the external fire. The space between the raised lands 25 on the upper surface of the plate 24 is usually filled with thermally insulating material. In the cable support shown in Figure 7, each of a plurality of separately operable ventilation holeclosure devices 18 comprises a strip 19 having a layer of intumescent material 20 on the side facing the bottom wall of the duct. Each strip 19 is supported at each of its ends not shown in Figure 7 and can be readily removed and replaced. In this arrangement there are no moving parts and in the event of an external fire which will cause heat and or flames to enter the ventilation holes 11, the intumescent material 20 on the strips 19 will rapidly expand and block the ventilation holes thereby restricting the extent to which heat and or flames can reach the cables supported in the duct. Although in the description of the three forms of cable support illustrated in the drawings, it is implied that the cable ducts lie in a substantially horizontal plane, it is to be understood that the or any cable duct of a cable support acdording to the present invention can be arranged at any angle to the horizontal provided that appropriate minor modifications are made to the operation of the ventilation hole closure devices.
