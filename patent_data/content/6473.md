# Gap measurement method.

## Abstract
This invention concerns a method for measuring the gap 10 between the bottom surface 12 of a component 14 and the top surface 16 of a substrate 18 on which the component is mounted. The gap 10 between a component 14 and its as sociated substrate 18 is measured by casting shadow edge 26 in a spot of light 28 directly below and edge 29 of the component 14 . A viewing means 32 is fixed at a predetermined angle 34 to the vertical from the sub strate 18 . The viewing means reticle 35 is first adjusted to coincide with either the shadow edge 26 of the com ponent 14 in the light spot 28 or the bottom edge 29 of the component 14 . The distance 44 that the viewing means 32 is moved horizontally from one edge to the other is measured. This measured horizontal distance 44 forms one side of a right triangle, the other side of which is the vertical distance 30 between the shadow edge 26 in the light spot 28 on the substrate 18 and the bottom edge 29 of the component 14 . The distance 30 can be calculated from the measured length 44 and the angle 34 which is the fixed angle the viewing means 32 makes with the vertical from the substrate 18 .
