# A METHOD OF HEAT BONDING INTERIOR MATERIAL

## Abstract
A heat bonding method for interior material includes heating one electrode of a high frequency welder. The temperature to which the elctrode is heated is generally about 100 C less than the melting point of the outermost interior finishing material. The increased temperature raises the susceptibility of the cushioning material to dielectric heating due to a high frequency oscillating voltage from the high frequency welder. There is also disclosed a method for selecting a urethane foam as a cushioning material which is optimal for use with the disclosed heat bonding method, by determining the specific gravity and the air permeability rate of the urethane foam.
