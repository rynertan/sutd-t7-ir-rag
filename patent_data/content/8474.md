Pairs of leaves were removed from broad bean plants and placed ventral side uppermost on filter paper inside petri dishes.The leaves were sprayed with the test solution using a logarithmic spraying machine and a dosage equivalent to 400 litres hectare, and allowed to dry for r 1 hour, Each leaf pair was infested with 10 aphids Temperature was held constant at 230C 2 C, and humidity and light fluctuated. The number of dead and moribund insects was counted after 24 hours. From the results, the LC the lethal dosage in percentage by weight required to kill 50 of the test insects was calculated. Toxicity indices were then calculated using the following formula LC50 of standard Toxicity Index bC5o of standard x 100 of of compound or mixture The standard used was ethyl parathion, The joint action of the two active components of a mixture was analysed by the method of Yun Pei Sun and E, R, Johnson,Journal of Economic Entomology, 1960, Vol, 53 no, 5, pp 887 892,A coefficient of co toxicity of a mixture is given by coefficient of actual toxicity index of mixture x 100 co toxicity of mixture theoretical toxicity index of mixture The ffieoretical toxicity index of a mixture is equal to the sum over both components of the percentage of each individual compound present in the mixture multiplied by its respective toxicity index A coefficient of co toxicity of a mixture near 100 indicates the probability of similar action by the two compounds independent action usually gives a coefficient less than 100 and a coefficient significantly above 100 strongly indicates synergism.
