# A pipelined analog to digital conversion system.

## Abstract
A pipelined analog to digital A D conversion system enhances the effective data rate of the converter in direct proportion to the number of stages in the pipeline 9 . The pipelined A D converter operates in conjunction with a charge coupled device CCD multilevel storage MLS 9 in a three bit eight level implementation. Three comparators AA, BB, CC are used in the three bit system arranged in a sequential successive approximation configuration with control circuits and a CCD shift register 8 .
