# Apparatus for applying marks to a product, e.g. a coil of rolled steel.

## Abstract
Marking apparatus especially for applying identifying marks to large coils, has a base 26 which is reciprocatingly moved along a track past the surface to be marked. Mounted on the base, so as to be movable transversely with respect to the base s movement, is a marking carriage 30 carrying marking means 36,37. In order to increase the area which can be marked and in particular to apply two lines of text, the carriage is mounted on the base by means of at least two spaced apart swiveling arms 29 which form an articulated quadrilateral such that the carriage is movable transversely between two limit positions with respect to the path of movement of the base.
