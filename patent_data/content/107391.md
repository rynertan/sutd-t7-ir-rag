# WIPER DEVICE FOR STRIPPING FLUID FROM WELL PIPE

## Abstract
A wiper device is provided comprising a container 1 having a central opening 4 through which the well string may pass. A pair of opposed wiper pads 9 disposed in a horizontal attitude are mounted in spaced vertical relationship within the container 1 for longitudinal movement toward each other, to engage the vertical string. A double acting pneumatic cylinder 25 actuates each pad. Each cylinder 25 is mounted in the plane of the pad 9 , said cylinder being connected at its front end with the rear portion of the wiper pad and being pivotally connected at its rear end with a support member. The front end of the cylinder 25 is thus adapted to rotate in a horizontal plane about its pivot connection, to accommodate transverse movement of the at tached wiper pad 9 . The container side walls 3 are spaced from the wiper pad edges to permit such transverse movement to take place. Arrays of anti friction rollers 8 support each of the pads. The spacing of the walls 3 , pivoting capability of the cylinder 25 in a horizontal plane, and provision of the anti friction means 8 combine to permit transverse movement of the wiper pads 9 . The head ends of the cylinders 25 are interconnected by a line to enable air, displaced from one cylinder, to move to the other, to permit of longitudinal movement of the pads. The head ends of the cylinders 25 are also connected with a pulsation tank, so that if both cylinders are simultaneously contracted by passage of an enlargement through the pads 9 , there is little change in wiping pressure. Thus the pads 9 can free float with the well string, while maintaining a substantially constant wiping pressure.
