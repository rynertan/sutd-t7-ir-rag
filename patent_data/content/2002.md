# Method of making uniform glass fiber mats by the wet laid process from an aqueous dispersion.

## Abstract
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided herein improved glass fiber dispersions for making uniform glass fiber mats by the wet laid process. The well dispersed glass fiber compositions of this invention usually are prepared by mixing chopped glass fibers in water with a small amount of an amine oxide surfactant. As a feature of the invention, the dispersions may be formed at relatively high glass fiber consistencies. The resultant dispersions then are used to make very high quality glass fiber mats at high rates of production.
