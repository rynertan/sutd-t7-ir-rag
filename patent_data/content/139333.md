# Method and apparatus for processing stuffed sausage casing.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for processing stuffed sausage casing to form individual sausages of uniform length is disclosed. The apparatus has a series of pairs of forming arms 34 mounted on a circular plate 32 . The arms 34 have on them stabilizers 70 . The arms 34 are moved into contact with the sausage casing 58 at sequentially spaced points along the length of the casing 58 . As a pair of forming arms 34 contact the casing 58 from opposite sides thereof, they force the food emulsion within the casing 58 away from the point of contact. As the forming arms 34 move further towards one another the stabilizers 70 contact the casing 58 to prevent the casing 58 from moving out of alignment with a slot 56 in each forming arm 34 and to assist in pushing the filling material within the casing 58 in a longitudinal direction away from the forming arms 34 .
