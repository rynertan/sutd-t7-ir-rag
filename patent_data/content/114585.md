# PORTABLE FUEL TANK STRUCTURE FOR OUTBOARD MOTORS

## Abstract
A portable fuel tank structure 1 for outboard motors having a transport handle 8 located on a smaller side wall 6 thereof, a tank filler 12 and a fuel supply pipe 14 , wherein the tank filler 12 is positioned close to said transport handle 8 so as to permit the fuel tank 1 , when it is in a full condition, to be transported in a vertical position without fuel leakage. The filler 12 is arranged in an inclined position with respect to the longitudinal axis of the fuel tank 1 . Also the fuel supply pipe 14 is positioned close to the tank filler 12 and arranged in an inclined position. The filler 12 and the fuel supply pipe 14 can be integrally molded in a single molding operation so as to form an assembly 20 to be secured to the fuel tank 1 as a single piece. The tank structure also provides means 16 for securing the fuel tank to the hull of a motor boat and means 38 39 for preventing it from moving on the hull.
