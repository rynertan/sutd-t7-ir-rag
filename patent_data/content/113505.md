# Water soluble polyesters.

## Abstract
Water soluble polyesters useful in the preparation of bioerodible hydrogels are described. The polyesters are formed by condensing three monomers a first monomer which is either an unsaturated aliphatic or cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acid or an unsaturated aliphatic or cycloaliphatic diol a second monomer which is a water soluble polyglycol and a third monomer which is a dicarboxylic acid having an electron withdrawing group placed vicinally to a carbonyl group of the acid. Water soluble polyesters with molecular weights ranging from about 5000 to about 30,000 are disclosed.
