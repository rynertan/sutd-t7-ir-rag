# Expression, processing and secretion of heterologous protein by yeast.

## Abstract
A yeast host organism is genetically altered via recom binant DNA technology so as to be directed to express, process and secrete a polypetide ordinarily heterologous to the host which is recoverable in discrate form, free from unwantad poly peptide presequences or other artifact of expression.
