# Device for analyzing and correcting wavefront surfaces in real time.

## Abstract
An optical system for analyzing and correcting distorted wavefronts comprising a deformable mirror for correcting said wavefronts a system for analyzing and detecting phase distorsions an interferometer with lateral shearing consti tuting the analysis and detecting system, receiving the distorted wavefront for analysis and duplicating it and deducing from two neighbouring points of the wavefront thus obtained signals for controlling deformation of said deformable mirror, wherein the interferometer with lateral shearing is formed of two 90 reflecting dihedrons, the bisecting lines of which cross at the center of the interfero meter, and one of the dihedrons can be moved through a predetermined distance parallel to the bisecting plane of the other and the other dihedron is vibrated cyclically parallel with its own bisecting plane.
