# Cooling system for automotive engine or the like.

## Abstract
In an internal combustion engine cooling system where in the coolant is boiled and the vapor produced condensed in a radiator in a manner that the rate of condensation under light engine load is maintained at a level sufficiently low to raise the pressure within the system and thus raise the boiling point of the coolant while under heavy load increased to the point of lowering the pressure in the system and thus lower the coolant boiling point, a reservoir valve arrange ment is provided which permits additional coolant to be inducted into the system, in the event that an excessively low or negative pressure occurs due to uncontrollable external influences , under the influence of the pressure differential which is established between the ambient atmosphere and the interior of the system. The coolant thus inducted is permitted to be displaced back out to the reservoir only when the temperature and pressure in the system is restored to the desired level.
