## Description
This invention relates to a tool for use in operating caravan stabilisers. Caravans are, for many people, a most useful form of holiday accommodation combining the comforts of a holiday apartment with the portability of a tent. While being towed between sites a caravan is supported at the front by the towing car and by the set of wheels provided on the caravan. Once the caravan is on site and has been unhitched from the car additional support is required to stabilise the caravan. This support is provided by four stabilisers each situated at a corner of the caravan. The stabilisers are moved from their storage position, adjacent the caravan body, to their in use position, where they bear against the ground, by the rotation of a screw situated on the stabiliser mounting. The screw is normally provided with a bolt head which the user must turn, by means of a socket spanner, to lower or raise the stabiliser. Many caravan bodies overhang the stabiliser mounting making the lowering and raising of the stabilisers a difficult and awkward operation, especially for older persons who form the majority of caravan owners.
