# SELF ADJUSTING SENSING MECHANISM

## Abstract
A sensing mechanism has a retainer ring 20 which is secured in an aperture 40 formed in a housing 12 in which a sensor 18 is to operate. The retainer ring has a plurality of tabs 44 which cooperate with axial and circumferential slots 46,48 on the sensor to permit removal and replace ment of the sensor without the need for adjustment. On original installation of the sensing mechanism, the retainer ring is positioned in the housing aperture by radially extending tines 36 co operating with the surface of the aperture. A resilient member 22 permits the mechanism to be installed to a depth deeper than the operating depth, whereupon the resilient member urges the sensor axially, as permitted by a gap 50 between the retainer ring and the circumferential slot, to achieve the proper operating depth.
