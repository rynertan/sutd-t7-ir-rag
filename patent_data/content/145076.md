# TELEVISION RECEIVER INPUT CIRCUIT

## Abstract
A television receiver of the type capable of displaying standard VHF and UHF television signals is provided with a single coaxial antenna input terminal. A passive input circuit within the receiver includes two filter sections for separating the VHF and UHF components of a combined VHF UHF signal applied to the input terminal for application to separate VHF and UHF tuning sections of the receiver. The first filter section, which is located within the UHF tuning section, includes a UHF tuning line for coupling the UHF component to the UHF tuning section. The second filter section, which is located in the VHF filter section, and incorporates elements of the first filter section, enhances the response of the receiver over transition frequencies between the VHF and UHF bands.
