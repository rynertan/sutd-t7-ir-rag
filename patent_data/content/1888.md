## Description
Sterilising composition and methods for its nunufacturc anal use Contact lenses composed of plastics material have been adopted increasingly for general usc. Such adoption and use have required the use of cleaning, sterilizing and or storing solutions. After removal from the cyc, the lens should he cleaned physically to remove forcign matter such as tear stain deposits and other accumulated foreign matter. In addition, such lenses should be sterilized against microorganisms prior to use. Typically, the uscr periodically removes the contact lens from the eye and effects clceming, sterilizing and storing in a solution for a period of time, e.g. overnight. Contact lenses have been composed of herd and soft plastics material. Hard plastic type contact lenses composed, for example, of conventional hard polymethacrylate polymers, have long been in use.Soft contact lenses, which may be of the hydrophilic or hydrophobic type, have been developed and adopted more recently. Such soft lenses may be composed either of hydrophobic type polymers or hydrophilic type polymers. The hydrophobic contact lenses often are based upon a polysiluxane polymer, such as cross linked dimethyl polysiloxane. The soft hydrophilic type contact lenses generally are composed of a polyhydroxylated polymer like, alkyl methacrylate, which has been crosslinked sparingly to form a polymeric hydrogel type structure. Such lenses are elastic, soft, transparent hydrogels containing, and permitting the lenses to absorb, a substantial mount of water. While the soft, hydrophilic, hydrogel type contact lenses are particularly useful, they have created difficult cleaning, sterilizing and storing problems, due in part to the hydrogel type structure of such soft contact lenses, at the ability of such structures to absorb and even to concentrate ingredients from the cleaning, sterilizing and storing solutions. Such soft contact lenses typically are composed of a three dimensional hydrophylic polymer, for example polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate. A wide variety of cleaning, sterilizing and or storing solutions slave been suggested for use with contact lenses, and particularly with the hydrogel type soft contact lenses. Some solutions have contained quaternary anslonium compounds or otller antimicrobial agents, such as chlorhexidene see US Patent No 3,689,673 . Some sterilizing solutions for contact lenses have included specific alcollols, such as phenylethyl alcohol see US Patent No 3,954,965 and polyvinyl alcohol see USPatent Nos 3,183,152 3,549,747 and 3,639,576 . Other contact lens treating solutions have employed various active ingredients, such as oxygen releasing salts see US Patent 3,873,696 , phosphates see US Patents 3,240,709 and 2,547,653 , ccllulosic components, such as methyl cellulose see US Patent 3,171,752 , and various block copolymers of polyethylene or polypropylene glycols see US Patents 3,954,644 and 3,882,036 . Such cornpsitions typically contain small amounts of a saline solution, together with the active ingredients, in order to provide an isotonic aqueous cleaning and sterilizing solution. Such contact lens treating solutions have not proven to be wholly satisfactory in use, and typically vary in effectiveness against a wide range of micro orOanislas often found particularly with the soft contact lenses, or contain rather exotic, potentially toxic or irritating ingredients which may limit their use. It is, therefore, desirable to provide a sinple, safe and effective aqueous sterilizing solution containing non irritating and non toxic substances which would be effective against the variety of mixed micro organisms typically found on contact lenses, with a rapid sterilizing effectiveness such that the sterilization could be accomplished easily overnight for example, 8 hours and preferably even in shorter periods of time. According to the invention there is provided an aqueous mixture of a sterilising proportion of two or more of a physiologically acceptable salt, a physiologically acceptable alcohol and a physiologically acceptable protein solubilizing agent. According to the invention there is also provided a method for the disinfection and storage of an object, for example medical apparatus, notably contact lenses, and in particular soft contact lenses, WhiClI method comprises contacting the object with an aqueous composition containing a sterilizing proportion of at least two of a physiologically acceptable salt, a physiologically acceptable alcohol and a physiologically acceptable protein solubilizing agent for a time sufficient to sterilize the object. The composition may consist essentially of water, sodium chloride and ethanol. In particular the invention concerns an aqueous sterilizing solution which comprises in combination a saturated or substantially saturated saline solution with ethyl alcohol, and preferably aml optionally a protein denaturing agent, such as urea, and to a method of employing such a solution in the sterilizing of soft, hydrophilic contact lenses. If desired the sterilizing solution may contain more than one compound selected from each group of compounds which go to make up the composition. Thus the composition may contain two or more physiologically acceptable salts, two or nore physiologically acceptable alcohols, and or two or more physiologically acceptable proteinsolubilizing agents. It has now surprisingly been found that, while a saturated or substantially saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution at about 33t weight volume sodium chloride is an effective antimicrohial solution, and that, while both urea and ethyl alcohol at 8 molar and 20 by volume, respectively, are effective bacterial killing agents alone, binary combinations of alcohol and saturated or substantially saturated halide salts, such as sodium chloride and ternary combinations thereof containing urea are surprisingly and synergistically effective against a wide range of micro organisms.Such binary and ternary combinations containing alcohol, saturated sodium clllorirle and optionally urea have been djscovcred to he simple e and rapid decontamminating and sterilizing solutions for medical apparatus and particulary for soft contacts lenses. Such compositions also have the advantage that they only contain materials endogenous to the human body. Bynary and ternary aqueons solutions according to the invention permit the effective and rapide sterilization for example, typically in less than 12 Iiours, and more particularly in 8 hours, and as low as 4 or less hours for example, 30 to 120 minutes, against the mixed micro organisms nornvllly associated with an l which contaminate contact lenses. Once sterilization has been effected, the apparatus may be rinsed, c.ç. in tap water, and, if desired. dried.The sterilizing solution nay be used without damange to the lens or injury to the eye of the uscr. The invention permits the contacting of the contact lens with the solution containing as an active ingredient an alcohol in combination with a saturated or hight concentration salt solution for decontamination and sterilization purposes. Tile sterilizing solution is employed easily by contacting, such as by soaking overnight or for a short period of time for example, 1 hour, or by washing, the lens to be sterilized with the aqueous sterilizing solution. The sterilizing solution has been tested and has been found to be effective particularly against the five indicator organisms recommended by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States of America the FDA for evaluation of lens sterilizing and decontaminating solutions. In its simplest embodiment, the seterilizing solution comprises binary combinations of a saturated or substantially saturated sodium chlorhide solution in combination with ethyl alcohol, and, optionally, where additional possible cleaning and some protein denaturization is required, urea may be added. The psihologically acceptable salt is preferably an inorganic salt and may be, for example, an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal halide or sulphate. Thus the salt may be a sodium, potassium, lithium, calcium, magnesium or solution chloride or bromide. The salt should, of course, have a reasonahle degree of water solubility in the presence of the other component or com rnents. Time preferred salt is sodium chloride. Tiie salt is preferably present in a concentration which is hypertonic wit l respect to tlle various organisms, for example, bacteria and fuingi, which it is desired to kill.Thus the salt for example, sodium cloride, may be represent from absut 2 to 33 , preferably from 5 to 33t, more preferably from 10 to 33 , and most preferably from 20 to 33 by weight of the composition. The sterilizing solution includes, as the preferred embodiment, saturated solutions of sodium chloride. However, it is recognized that other non toxic salts, such as those of alkali, including ammonium, halides, may be employed. However, sodium chloride is the preferred salt, due to its high sterilizing activity and wide acceptance, non toxic nature and low cost. The physiologically acceptable alcohol nay he a lover, and preferably a lower monohydric alkanol for example containing up to 6 carbon atoms, e.g. methanol, isopropanol, butanol or preferably ethanol. The alcohol may represent from about 5 to 70 , preferably 104 to 50 and more preferably from 10 to 30 by volume of the composition. The preferred alcohol is ethyl alcohol. Ilsever, other alcohol or alcohol containing materials also may be employed, particularly the lower molecular weight non toxic alcohols, c.g, polyhydroxy alcohols, such as polyethylene glycol or a polyvinyl alcohol. The physiologically acceptable protein solubilizing agent is preferably such that it will split and denature the proteins likely to contaminate the object to be treated. Thus in the case of contact lenses, it is preferred to use an agent capahle of denaturing and solubilizing the mucous protein associated with the eye. A particular example of a suitable solubilizing agent is urea. The solubilizing agent may be present in the composition at a concentration of from 2 to 8, and preferably fran 5 to 8, molar. The water used in the composition may be hard or soft and is preferably sterile distilled or deionized water. Preferred sterilizing solutions of the invention comprise the binary combinations of 25.8 weight volume sodium chloride and 10 by volume ethyl alcohol and 26.4 weight volume sodium chloride and 20 by volume ethyl alcohol. Effective ternary solutions comprise 7.655 weight volume sodium chloride, 20 by volume ethyl alcohol, and about 2.90 molar urea and 8.291 weight volune sodium chloride, 2.90 molar urea and 10t by volume ethyl alcohol. The most particularly preferred sterilizing solution comprise saturated sodium chloride, 7,90 molar urea and 20 by volume ethyl alcohol. As will seen from the above description, the compositions according to the invention fall into four general groups 1. Aqueous mixtures of salt and the alcohol 2. Aqueous mixtures of salt and the solubilizing agent 3. Aqueous mixtures of alcohol and the solubilizing agent and 4. Aqueous mixtures of alcohol, the solubilizing agent and the salt. Of these groups 1 and 4 are preferred. Particulary preferred are aqueous mixtures of ethanol and sodium chloride especially aqueous ethanolic solutions whitch are substantially satured with sodium chloride. Specific compositions from such groups include, but are not limited to 16.6 w v NaCl 10 v v Ethanol 20.4 20 8.33 10 11.1 10 16.6 20 11.1 6.67 v v 20.2 6.67 25.8 10 v v In group 4 preferred compositions comprise a mixture of sodium chloride, ethanol and urea. Particulary preferred are compositions saturated with sodium chloride.Specific compositions from group 4 include, but are not limited to Urea Molar NaCl w v Ethanol v v 2.67 11 6.67 2.9 7.65 20 2.67 11.1 10 2 11.1 6.67 2 8.33 6.67 2.67 8.33 10 2 8.33 10 2.67 8.33 6.67 2 11.1 10 2.9 8.2 9 10 2 7 6.67 2 8.3 20 2.67 11.1 20 2.67 8.3 20 In addition to the components set out above, the comnositions of the invention may contain other physiologically acceptable ingredients for example, compositions for use with contact lenses may contain ingredients which are acceptaltle or useful in the eye for example, ophthalmic topical medications that are compatible with for example, do not precipitate in the chosen solution. The concentration of the ingredients in the sterilizing solution nay vary depending on the object to be treated and the particular organisms to be removed. Thus the amount of salt employed is preferably sufficient to provide a saturated or substantially saturated solution, which amount of salt by weight will vary, depending upon the amount of alcohol present, with, of course, some variations based on the temperature.Typical concentrations of salts in the sterilizing solutions range from as high as 33toe by weight sodium chloride for a fully saturated solution, alone, and typically to as low as about 5b, depending upon the amount of alcohol present, with typically the alcohol varying in amount by volume from See to 70 , preferably 10 to 504 and more typically between 10t to 254. The amount of urea may vary as desired, ranging up to 8 molar, but more typically ranging from about 1 molar to about 3 molar. The sterilizing solutions are easily prepared merely hy admixing the ingredients to form a sterile, aqueous, clear solution. A preferred process is to mix ethanol and a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride. Of course, if desired and optionally, and apart from the active ingredients specified above, other components may be added, such as other microbial agents, buffers, lubricants, quaternary ammonium carrpunds, viscosity control agents, surfactants, wetting agents and similar active ingredients, provided that such ingredients do not alter or affect the sterilizing functions of the active ingredients. The sterilizing solutions may be used in the treatment of soft contact lenses containing or contaminated with mixed microbial agents, and, therefore, the term sterilization as used herein is directed to the sterilization of those five indicating organisms recommended by the FDA and as tested herein for evaluation of lens decontaminating solutions. Effective sterilization times by the solutions are measured by the hours required for total kill of the organisms, i.e.the number of hours required to obtain no survivors where the sensitivity of tlie assay is 10 cells per ml or less. The sterilizing solution may be used for 12 hours, e.g. overnight storage of a lens in the solution and more particularly for 6 hours and even more particularly for 60 minutes. The method of use of the sterilizing solution is simple in that the wearer of the lens merely removes the lens from his eye and places it in a container with a sufficient amount of the sterilizing composition. The lens is allowed to soak for a period of at least about 30 minutes, and preferably 1 to 8 hours. This contacting of the lens may also be used to inhibit the formation of proteinaceous deposits and accumulations on the lens in use. Typically, the method of use is carried out at ambient temperatures, or at slightly elevated temperatures, if desired for example, 200C to 400C. Ilard contact lenses and other medical apparatus may be sterilized by washing or immersing the apparatus in the sterilizing solution. Such other medical apparatus may include, but not be limited to catheters, tubes, surgical instruments and the like. The sterilizing solution may be used on medical apparatus and materials which, like the soft contact lenses, do not tolerate readily existing or harsh sterilizing methods, such as boiling, and more particularly wherein the medical apparatus and material easily exchange any liquid contained thercin with a sterilizing solution. The invention is illustrated, but in no way limited by the following Examples in which EtOH represents ethanol.Example 1 Tests were carried out to determine tlle sterilizing effects of selected solutions of salt and or urea and or ethyl alcohol on micro organisms. For these experiments, the final mix ccll suspension plus test solution was designed to contain approximately 1 x 106 cells per ml. Test systems were incubated at room teinperature 220C to 250C . Aliquots were withdrawn at designated intervals of time, as shown in the Tables, and were serially diluted in sterile 0.9 saline solution. Duplicate pour plates were made at dilutions of 10 1, 10 and 10 5 for each sample, adding about 15 nll of cooled 45 C Trypticase Soy Agar to 1 ml of dilutecl san ple in a sterilePetri dish.Colonies were counted after 48 hours incubation at 370C. Seven combinations were selected for study of their killing capacity against each of the five organisms recomended by the FDA for the evaluation of decontaminating solutions for contact lenses.The results of such experiments are shown in Table I.

Nonetheless, all thrce combinations resulted ill total elimination of viable micro organisms within one hour.Example 3 Tests were carried out to evaluate the efficacy of the selected sterilizing solution on soft contact hydrogel type lenses seeded with known levels of bacteria. Inoculation of lenses A series of sterile, flexible, soft contact lenses Corncal Sciences Inc decontaminated by boiling in physiological salinc was drailled using sterile cotton swabs for handling and seeded on the inner concave surface with 5 l of a suspension of the organisms set out in Table II 1 x 106 cells , and was allowed to dry at room temperature in a covcred sterilePetri dish or covered multi well slates for 0, 5, 10, 15 and 30 minutes. At the end of each of these time periods, a seeded lens was transferred with sterile forceps to a tube of sterile nutrient brotll which was incubated at 370C for 6 hours.Growth in the broth culture was estimated by optical density every 2 hours. The maximum drying time which allows the best growth, equal to the zero drying time control, was selected as a drying time to use in subsequent studies. Optimally, the time chosen should be adequate to load the lens with micro organisms, but not so long that the inoculun is killed by the drying. Decontamillation of seeded lenses A series of lenses flexible soft contact lenses, Corncal Sciences Inc was seeded with bacterial suspensions 1 x 106 cells in 1 ml, same five species as in Example 2 and was allowed to dry for 10 minutes. Single lenses, contained in the well of a multi well plate, were filled with 1.0 ml of the test decontaminating solutions. At 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours, lenses were drained and transferred to a tube containing 5 ml of sterile physiological saline. After thorough agitation, the saline was serially diluted and bacterial counts were determined by the pour plate method. The lenses were transferred to a broth tube and were incubated for 48 hours as a further stcrility check.The spent decontaminating solutions were serially diluted from a starting dilution of 1 5, and pour plates were made to determine actual numbers of survivors in the solutions.
