# Combline filter.

## Abstract
A comb line type dielectric filter in which a plurality of resonator holes are made in a dielectric block at predetermined intervals and a coupling adjustment hole is made between the resonator holes, the interior sur faces of the resonator holes and the surface of the dielectric block being entirely or partly covered with a conductor film. The coupling adjustment hole is disposed apart from the line joining the centers of the resonator holes, and a coupling adjusting member made of metal or dielectric material is inserted into the coupling ad justment hole.
