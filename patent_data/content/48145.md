# Heat resistant expandable plastic particles and moulded products made therefrom.

## Abstract
Heat resistant expandable plastic particles made from a polymer and a volatile blowing agent in which the polymer comprises 15 to 55 by weight α alkylstyrene units and 85 to 45 by weight units of other polymerizable monomer. The polymer can be made by emulsion polymerization and the pelleted and impregnated with blowing agent. Foamed mould products are made by thermal prefoaming at a gauge pressure of more than 0.1 kg cm² 9.8kPa and subsequent thermal moulding. The products have superior heat resist ance as compared with conventional foamed moulded polystyrene foams.
