# Precision TW electroerosion with superimposed multiple opening guides.

## Abstract
A traveling wire TW electroerosion apparatus in which at least one of wire guides which are disposed at opposite sides of the cutting zone comprises a plurality of guide elements with respective circular wire receptive guide openings each of which is of a diameter substantially larger than a nominal diam eter of the electrode wire and which are arranged to be mutual ly eccentric to make up a composite guide opening such that the diameter of an immaginary cylinder which can be inscribed therein is substantially equal to the nominal wire diameter. Preferably, the guide elements are arranged to be displaceable relative to one another and in their respective planes to change the eccentricity of these guide openings and thus to change the diameter of the imaginary cylinder.
