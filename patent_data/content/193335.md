# Detection of abnormality for rotational speed sensor.

## Abstract
In an apparatus for detecting the abnormality of a rotational speed sensor adapted for, for example, an anti skid control system, a time period within which a subsequent pulse will be generated by the rotational speed sensor in response to the rotation of a body of revolution such as wheel is estimated on the basis of the latest pulse interval of the pulses previously generated therefrom and a value corresponding to the force of inertia of the wheel developed on the braking operation thereof. The determination of abnormality of the rotational speed sensor is made when the subsequent pulse is not produced within the estimated time period. This is arranged based on the fact that the pulse interval depends upon the inertial force of the wheel. With the above arrangement, the abnormality detection of the speed sensor can be quickly made, so that a fail safe control in a braking system can be speedily performed in response to the occurrence of abnormality of the speed sensor.
