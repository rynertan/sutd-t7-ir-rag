# METHOD FOR DEVELOPING MAGNETIC LATENT IMAGES

## Abstract
A method of developing latent magnetic images uses a magnetic toner which is flash fused onto the copy medium. The toner particles are deposited to a pile height of 3 30 Âµm, and the toner comprises a mixture of magnetic material and a resin comprising a polymeric esterification product of a dicarboxylic acid and a diol comprising a diphenol having a specified formula.
