# VERTICAL DRAWING CURTAIN COATING METHOD AND APPARATUS

## Abstract
This invention develops a new kind of vertical drawing curtain coating method and apparatus, which contains three main parts a higher uniform equal flow distributing coater, a vertical drawing short curtain, a parallel rotated coating roller and moving webs. This coating method can simul taneously coat one or more than one layer with high uniformity, and is suitable for silver salt or non silver salt photo sensitive materials production. It can use a liqud viscosity from 2 to 1,000 mPas at a coating velocity 30 to 300 mm in to get a coating weight from 20 to 240 ml mÂ² and can avoid coating defects such as those usually found in the bead coating and vertical free falling curtain coating methods.
