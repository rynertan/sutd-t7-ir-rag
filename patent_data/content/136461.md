# Level sensitive scan design testable latch circuit apparatus.

## Abstract
A level sensitive scan design testable latch circuit apparatus is disclosed which has systems operational and testing operational modes. The apparatus is arranged with first and second groups of three flip flops 1, 2, 3 6, 7, 8 each. Control means 4, 5 allow for selective operation of the first group of flip flops 1, 2, 3 as a D type edge triggered latch during the systems operational mode, and of the first and second groups of flip flops 1, 2, 3 6, 7, 8 as a three stage shift register during the testing operational mode. The control means 4, 5 also allows the D type edge triggered latch to have override asychronously set and or reset control.
