## Description
HIGH IMPACT COPOLYMERS This invention relates to high impact polymers of styrenic monomers. Styrene has been used for a long period of time in the manufacture of polymers and polystyrene has attained a large market for many purposes. The nuclear slkyl substituted styrenes have also been used in various applications. The monomer which has been principally used is known as vinyltoluene. This is a mixture which consists mainly of meta and para methyl styrenes vinyl toluenes produced by the catalytic dehydrogenation of a mixture of the corresponding m and p ethyltoluenes.The ethyltoluene mixture is itself obtained by the fractional distillation of a mixture of the o , m and pethyltoluenes. The ratio of the m and p isomers in the monomer mixture is approximately 65 35 m p . A convenient summary of the preparation and properties of the monomer mixture and of copolymers produced from it is given in Styrene Its Polymers Copolymers and Derivatives Ed.R. H. Boundy, R. F. Boyer, ACS Monograph Series, 1952,Hafner Publishing Company, Pages 1232 to 1245. High impact copolymers are also known. These materials are generally prepared by a grafting technique in which styrene is polymerized in the presence of a rubbery backbone polymer. Techniques for preparing such polymers are well known and are described, for example, in U.S. 2694692 and GB 1054301. We have now found that high impact copolymers having advantageous properties may be made from a mixture of isomexic methyl ethenylbenzenes having a particular isomeric distribution. The polymerizable isoneric mixture consists essentially of the m and p isomers of methyl ethenyl benzene. The mixture is substantially devoid of the o isomer when the o isomer is present, the amount of it is less than 0.1t based on the total weight of the isomer mixture. The ratio of the isomers in the mixture is as follows Isomer RJt. Percent 1 methyl 2 ethenyl benzene Less than 0.1 preferably less than 0.05.1 methyl 3 ethenyl benzene Less than 15, preferably less than 10. 1 methyl 4 ethenyl benzene 85 99 preferably at least 90. Generally, the proportion of the p isomer 1 nethyl 4 ethenyl benzene will be at least 95 weight percent with the m isom.er 1 methyl 3 ethenyl benzene constituting less than 5 weight percent of the mixture. Particularly preferred mixtures contain 97 to 99 weight percent of the p isomer and 1 to 3 weight percent of the m isomer. The isoner mixture may contain impurities and adventitious materials in addition to the methyl ethenyl benzenes. Generally, these other materials will not constitute more than 1 percent by weight of the total mixture These dither materials derive essentially from the process used to make the methyl ethenyl benzenes. A typical isomer mixture has the following analysis, by weight, determined by gas chronatography Wt. percent Total vinyl benzenes 99.41 Residue Ethyl toluene 0.10 Mesitylenes etc. 0.15 Non vinylic higher boilers 0.34 0.59 0.59 100.00 Vinyl benzenes 1 methyl 2 ethenyl benzene C.05 1 methyl 3 ethenyl benzene 2.6 1 methyl 4 ethenyl benzene 97.4 The mixture of the isoneric methyl ethenyl benzenes may be obtained by the catalytic dehydrogenation of a mixture of the corresponding ethy toluenes, as described in our co pending Dutch PatentApplication No. 78 04960 Mobil Case F 96SS , equivalent to German Patent Application No. 2,819,304, British PatentApplication No. 19817 78, and Belgian Patent No. 865,880. The ethyl toluene precursor is produced by the alkylation of toluene with ethylene in the presence of certain crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite catalysts.The catalyst has a silica to alumina ratio of at least 12 and a constraint index within the range of 1 to 12.The process produces an extremely high proportion of the 1 methyl 4 ethyl .benzene isomer, with only a minor proportion of the l nethyl 3 ethyl benzene isomer and negligible amounts of the 1 methyl 2 ethyl benzene isomer. The almost ccmplete absence of the 1 methyl 2 ethyl isomer is highly advantageous because this isomer tends to produce undesired by products during the dehydrogenation step indanes and indenes which adversely affect the properties of the resultant polymers and which cannot be easily separated from the methyl ethenyl benzenes . The mixture of isoneric ethyl toluenes may be subjected to distillation prior to the dehydrogenation step in order to separate out various by products and after the hydrogenation has been completed, a further distillation may be carried out to separate the methyl ethenyl benzenes from their saturated precursors. Since the propbrtion of the 1 methyl 4 ethenyl benzene in the mixture is so high, usually at least 95 by weight, the mixture can be regarded essentially as the para 1,4 isomer. For convenience in this specification, therefore, the mixture may be referred to as the para isomer monomer . The high impact copolymers are generally graft copolymers produced by graftin units derived from the polymerizable methyl ethenyl benzene monomer mixture onto a backbone polymer which is generally of a rubbery nature. Suitable backbone polymers include polybutadiene, poly dimethyl butadiene , polyisoprene, polychloroprene and other synthetic rubbers such as the styrene butadiene rubbers SBP. , ethylene propylene rubbers EPR , ethylene propylene diene elastomers, polyacrylates, nitrile rubbers and copolymers with other aromatic monomers including vinyl toluene. The backbone will generally comprise 2 to 25 percent by weight of the high impact copolymer, preferably 3 to 10 percent by weight.Normal techniques, e.g. grafting, comparable to those used for making high impact polystyrenes are useful they are well known in the art and referred to, for example, in U.S. Patent 2694692 and BritishPatent 1054301. Thus, the polymerization is preferably carried out by the bulk polymerization technique with the rubbery backbone polymer dissolved in the monomer mixture, although, if desired other techniques may be used e.g. bulk polymerization followed by emulsion polymerization or emulsion polymerization alone. A preferred technique consists in making an initial bulk polymerization with the backbone polymer dissolved in the monomer mixture. then the polymerization has proceeded partly, this mixture is dispersed in a suitable suspending medium e.g. water and the polymerization continued as an emulsion. The normal types of polymerization catalyst may be used e.g. free radical initiators such as di tertiary butyl peroxide, azobis iso butyronitrile , di benzoyl peroxide, tertiary butyl perbenzoate, di cumyl peroxide or potassiun persulfate. If an emulsion or suspension polymerization technique is use, stabilizers may be added to stabilize the systen while the polymerization continues. These stabilizers are generally surfactants but other materials such as polyvinyl alcohols may be used also. Molecular weight modifying agents may be added in the course of the polymerization in order to improve the properties of the final impact polymer. The mercaptans, particularly alkyl mercaptans are suitable molecular weight control agents. Dodecyl mercaptan is preferred. The mercaptans are preferably used in an amount from 0.005 to 0.5 , generally 0.05 to 0.257a, by weight, as is conventional. The high impact copolymers derived from ethylene propylene diene elastomers are particularly advantageous in their high temperature stability and weatherability. The copolymers produced from polyisoprene have exceptionally high impact strengths as shown by their Izod impacts. Furthermore, the high impact copolymers according to the present invention are more translucent in thin sections than similar high impact polystyrenes. This is probably because the refractive index of the present polymers is closer to that of the backbone polymers than that of polystyrene.A typical comparison of properties is given in Table 1 below. The samples were high impact materials containing 4.89 phm parts per hundred monomer of cis polybutadiene.

If such other monomers are used they are preferably used in proportions of less than 50 for economic reasons. However, their use does enable the properties of the final polymer to be varied and if desired, the amount of monomer may be increased above 50 .

Into a clean, dry, nitrogen purged, three liter, four neck, round bottom flask was charged 272.7g of polybutadiene latex Polysar PL 662 trademark 55 polybutadiene . The flask was fitted with a stirrer, thernometer, reflux condenser and 1000 ml addition funnel. A solution was prepared by mixing 12.0 g sodium stearate, 0.9 g sodium bicarbonate, 1.5 g sodium hydroxide, 3.0 g potassium persulfate and 1322 g deionized water. The mixture was heated to 600C while stirring until a clear, homogeneous solution was obtained. This solution was then charged into the reaction flask to dilute the stirred polybutadiene latex. A solution containing 435.6 g of the mixture o Example 1, 164.4 g acrylonitrile and 2.7 g tert dodecyr mercaptan was prepared and placed in the addition funnel.With stirring and the charge temperature controlled at 600C., monomer addition was started and maintained at 0.5 min. After all the monomer had been added, polymerization was allowed to proceed for one additional hour. The latex was sampled to determine conversion by measuring total solids content. Antioxidant was added to the latex in the form of 42 g of an 18 emulsion containing 2 1 TNPP Irganox 1076 trademark . The final copolymer was recovered by pouring the hot, filtered latex into four volumes of rapidly stirred, 1.5 aqueous Cacl2 solution at 1000C. The crumb was filtered and hot water washed. The crumb was vacuum dried for 40 hours at 85 C with a slow nitrogen sweep through the oven. Conversion was over 95 . Precoagulum present in the latex was less than one percent, based on total resin. The yield of resin was about 740 g. injection molded samples, prepared by direct mold of the dried resin crumb, had notched Izod Impact Strength of 6.3 ft.Ib in. The product is suitable for extrusion or injection molding to form hard, tough, impact resistant articles such as drain pipe or appliance housings. Example 6 A number of high impact copolymers were prepared by the method described in Example 2. These copolymers were made using styrene, vinyl toluene and 2 methyl ethenyl benzene mixture as the graft comonomers. The vinyl toluene was a commercial material containin meta methyl styrene and para methyl styrene in a ratio of about 65 35. The methyl ethenyl benzene isomer mixture contained about 972 by weight of para methyl styrene and less than 0.1,0 by weight ortho methyl styrene, with the balance being essentially the meta isomer. Compression molded samples of the impact copolymers produced were then tested. The results are shown below in Table 2 with the results of a commercial impact polystyrene given for comparison.
