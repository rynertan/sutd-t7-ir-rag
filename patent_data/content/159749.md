## Description
ACTIVATED HBsAg PRODUCTVazcines against hepatitis are known for instance from British patent specification 1 282 984.The invention provides a vaccine contains hepatitis B surface antigen HBsAg isolated from human HBsAg containing blood plasma, prepared synthetically or by DNA recombinant techniques which vaccine is 10 100 times more immunogenic than the commercially available hepatitis B vaccines.A vaccine according to the invention contains an activated HBs antigen product as mentioned above and 0.1 99.5 human and or animal protein material based on its total protein content not being anti HBs antibodies, in which the HBsAg particles are aggregated to agglomerates having a thickness of 18 22 nanometers and a length of 36 nanometers at a minimum or in which vaccine the single HBsAg particles are complexed with plasma proteins of human or animal origin.Such a vaccine can be prepared by mixing human HBsAg positive blood plasma with an aqueous polyethylene glycol solution PEG to a final concentration of 5 weight volume . After removal of the precipitate containing the bulk of infectious Dane particles, the HBsAg containing supernatant is subjected to purification steps in which HBsAg is partly purified.Suitable purification methods are 1. precipitation with 6 PEG at pH 3.5, followed by ultracentrifugation of the resuspendate at 200,000 x g for 24 3 hours.2. lmmuneadsorption on a human, animal or monoclonal anti HBs conjugated cqlumn, desorption with 3 molar sodium thiocyanate NaCNS and dialysis againstPhosphate Buffer Saline PBS .Such HBsAg preparations contain single 18 22 nm particles, which are about 10 times more immunogenic in aqueous solution in mice potency tests than highly purified liBsAg particles, probably because of the presence of plasma proteins complexed to HBsAg, playing an important role in contracting immunity in vivo.Such an HBsAg protein mixture containing 0.1 99.5 HBsAg based on the total amount of proteins is 0 subjected to heat treatment in the range of 60 400 C, preferably in the range of 80 1200C Generally the heat treatment is carried out at a temperature in the range of 85.110 0C. In consequence of this heating procedure the single HBsAg particles are aggregated to agglomerates and the immunogenicity is significantly increased.A vaccine containing such an activated HBs antigen product according to the invention may contain only 0.1 10 by weight of HBsAg proteins based on the total amount of proteins.However, it is also possible to subject a more purified HBsAg product to the heat treatment mentioned above, provided that purification methods leading to highly purified HBsAg particles and removing of associated proteins from the surface antigen, such as equilibrium centrifugation in CsCl or KBr gradients, are avoided.Example 1Human blood plasma which contained Hepatitis B surface antigen HBsAg was mixed with Freon 113 Du Pont deNemours Int. S.A., Switzerland in a volume ratio of 2 1 at room temperature for half an hour. After centrifugation three layers were formed consisting of a solution of extracted lipoid material, a layer of clear plasma and thereinbetween a precipitate. 10 Parts of the clear plasma protein solution Vo were mixed with 25 parts of an 0.15 molar phosphate buffered saline PBS solution pH 7.4 and 5 parts of a 40 by weight s aqueous polyethylene glycol solution PEG 6000, final concentration 5 weights bu volume . The precipitate formed after an incubation of 1 night at 40C was centrifuged off and removed and to the supernatant a 40 by weight s aqueous PEG 6000 solution was added to a final concentration of 6 weight volume . By addition of a 2.5 molar hydrochloric acid solution the pH thereof was adjusted to 3.5. After an incubation during 1 night the precipitate formed was centrifuged off and the supernatant was removed. The precipitate was suspended in 1 5 of the original volume Vo by addition of a PBS solution pH 7.4 . By addition of a 2.5 molar sodium hydroxyde the pH was adjusted to 7.4. By ultracentrifuging this solution at 200,000 x g for 3.5 hours a sediment was obtained. This sediment which consists of HBsAg proteins only for a small portion and consists of human plasma proteins for the remainder, was suspended by addition of 1 10 of the original volume Vo phosphate buffered saline PBS solution pH 7.4 .For 90 seconds this protein mixture was heated to 101.5 104 QC in a closed continuous flow system.Because of the overpressure in the system, the solution did not boil. Under these circumstances the non heatresistant plasma proteins precipitated, but the major part of the RBsAg protein remained in solution.After removal of the insoluble proteins by ultracentrifuging for 1 hour at 48,000 x g and addition of Tween 80 to a final concentration of 50 mg l the aqueous protein solution of the vaccire, consisting for at least of 0.5 by weight of specific tEsAc proteins, was filtered in a sterile way and collected in a presterilized suspension of aluminium phosphate inPBS pH 7.4 . The final suspension contained 3 pg HBsAg and 25 millimol aluminium phosphate per ml. Glass ampoules were filled with doses of 1 ml. The ampoule was heated to 650C for a further 10 hours the so called pasteurisation .When comparing a vaccine, as described above, with currently available HB vaccines consisting of highly purified HBsAg particles and which were not heated at 101.5 1040C, it appeared that when tested in mice and humans the above vaccine was 10 100 times more immunogenic.In accordance therewith it turned out that in humans with a normal immune reactivity the above vaccine could be administered in a 10 100 times lower specific antigen dose than HB vaccines which were not prepared according to the invention. Example 2 10 Parts of human plasma which contained hepatitis B surface antigen HBsAg were mixed with 25 parts of 0.15 molar phosphate buffer Saline PBS solution pH 7.4 and 5 parts of a 40 by weight s aqueous polyethylene glycol solution PEG 6000, final concentration 5 weight volume . The precipitate formed after incubation overnight at 40C was centrifuged off and removed. The obtained 5 PEG supernatant was incubated for 2 16 hours with a column conjugated with human polyclonal or monoclonal anti HBs. Per international unit anti HBs conjugated to the sepharose 100 1000 nanograms of HBsAg in the 5 PEG supernatant were incubated with the column. Not specifically bound proteins were washed away from the column with PBS 4 6 times column volume .The specifically bound HBsAg particles and associated plasma proteins are eluted from the column with 2 4 times column volume of a 3 molar sodium thiocyanate NaSCN solution inPBS pH 7.4 followed by 2 4 times column volume PBS.The EBsAg protein mixture in the NaCNS eluate is concentrated and the NaCNS is removed by dialysis against PBS.To the thus formed HBsAg concentrate, containing also plasma proteins tredominantly human albumin and immunoglobulins in a range of 0.5 to 10 of the total protein content in the preparation, was added Tween 80 to a final concentration of 50 mg l.Figure 1 shows an electron microscopy picture of a thus obtained preparation in which single 18 22 nmHBsAg particles can be seen.For 90 seconds this protein mixture containing 40 400 krg HBsAg was heated to 101.5 104 C in a closed system. Because ofoverpressure in the system the solution did not boil. Under these circumstances the nonheat resistant plasma proteins, including possible residual heat inactivated Dane particles, precipitated but the major part of the HBsAg proteins remained in solution. After removal of the insoluble material by centrifugation for 1 hour at 48,000 x g the clarified aqueous solution of the vaccine was filtered in a sterile way through a membrane filter. Figure 2 shows an electron microscopy picture of a thus obtained preparation after heat treatment, in which longitudinal aggregates of HBsAg particles can be seen.Finally the aqueous vaccine solution is pasteurized for 10 hours at 650C either before or after coupling the vaccine to 25 millimolar aluminium phosphate.When comparing the aqueous solution of the vaccine obtained according to example 2 it appeared in mice potency tests that the vaccine after heat treatment was a factor 10 100 times more immunogenic than an aqueous solution of highly purified HBsAg in which the remaining plasma proteins albumin and immunoglobulins were removed by CsCl gradient centrifugation at 200,000 xg for 40 hours.
