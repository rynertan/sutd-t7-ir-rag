# Buffer amplifier circuit and address buffer circuit using such buffer amplifier circuit.

## Abstract
A high speed buffer amplifier circuit comprising a first inverter including a driver transistor Q13 , a second inverter which receives the output signal B from the first inverter, and a control transistor Q17 which is driven by the output signal C from the second inverter and which operates so as to enlarge upon a change in the potential difference between the gate and the source electrode of the driver transistor Q13 of the first inverter, when the level of input signal A is changed.
