# Optical disc drive apparatus.

## Abstract
An optical disc drive apparatus has a remarkably improved track accessing ability in comparison with conventional like ap paratus. On a base are provided an optical system having a light emitting element and a light sensing element, as well as an opti cal path deflecting element which performs a precision track ing. Further, an objective lens and a light guide element are provided on a rotating element which performs track seek and rough tracking. The light guide element comprises two reflect ing members which are opposed in parallel with each other.
