# Suds suppressing compositions and detergents containing them.

## Abstract
Storage stable, particulate suds suppressing composi tions containing a liquid hydrocarbon, a nonionic ethoxylate and a compatibilizing agent capable of forming inclusion compounds are disclosed. In addition to the liquid hydrocar bon, the suds suppressing compositions frequently comprise additional suds suppressing agents such as silica and or solid waxes. Granular detergents containing the particulate suds suppressing compositions and a method of enhancing the efficacy of liquid hydrocarbon suds regulants are also dis closed.
