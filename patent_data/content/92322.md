# Selectively light transmitting panel.

## Abstract
A one panel 41 which transmits rays of light incident at a range of angles of incidence while reflecting rays of light incident within a narrow range of angles of incidence, com prising a plurality of adjacent triangular prisms 43 , the prisms having one right angle, the other two angles being such as to result in the double total internal reflection of rays 44 incident within the narrow range of angles of in cidence. In addition, a substantially transparent panel which se lectively transmits rays of light within a range of angles of incidence while reflecting rays of light incident within a nar row range of angles of incidence, comprising at least one pair of complementary one layer sheets 122, 124 , each comprising a plurality of adjacent right triangular prisms, the prisms having two other angles such as to result in the double total internal reflection of rays incident within the narrow range of angles of incidence, the prisms of the two sheets fitting together in a complementary relationship and being separated by an air gap 123 .
