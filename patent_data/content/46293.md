# Rotary fluid pressure device and valve seating mechanism therefor.

## Abstract
A rotary fluid pressure device 11 is disclosed of the type including an internal gear set 17 defining expanding and contracting volume chambers 29 . The device further includes a stationary valve member 19 and a rotary valve member 55 having engaging valve surfaces 71, 73 . A valve seating mechanism 75 in cludes an annular balancing ring member 77 having a valve confronting surface 78 engaging an opposite surface 68 of the rotary valve. In accordance with the present invention, it has now been recognized that stalling of the device is normally caused by separation of the balancing ring from the rotary valve, rather than lift off of the rotary valve from the stationary valve. There is disclosed several ways of modifying the valve seating mechanism to prevent substantial flow of leak age fluid through the balancing passages 107 which, in turn, causes a substantial pressure differential across the balancing ring, and separation of the balancing ring from the rotary valve. In one embodiment, the balancing ring includes an annular groove 105 which is sufficient to communicate substantially all leakage flow to a drain passage 66 defined by the rotary valve to prevent a build up of pressure acting on the valve confronting surface 78 .
