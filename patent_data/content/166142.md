# Metal silicide channel stoppers for integrated circuits and method for making the same.

## Abstract
Disclosed is the use of metal silicide e.g. Pt Si con tacts in boron lightly doped P type silicon between two contiguous but not adjacent N type regions instead of employing the usual P implanted or diffused channel stop pers. The invention finds a particularly interesting applica tion in polyimide filled deep trench isolated integrated cir cuits. The trench sidewalls are coated with an insulating ma terial which is removed from the trench bottom at the all contact etch step. The Pt Si is formed at the bottom of the trenches at the same time that the device contacts are made.
