Standard ASTM 6.35 cm x 1.27 cm x 0.32 cm 2 1 2 X 1 2 X1 8 flexural test samples were injection molded from PGA on an Arburg molding machine using various mold temperatures from 30.56 C 87 F up to 90.0 C 194 F . Green strength and flexural 3 point bending properties were measured, that is parts immediately removed from the machine. Flexural 3 point bending properties as well as mold shrinkage were measured on as molded parts after room temperature cooling. Shrinkage during annealing was determined from linear dimensional measurements taken both before and after annealing. Flexural 3 point bending properties were also determined on the annealed samples. Specific details on the test procedures and results may be found in the tables. The following terms are used in Tables 1 to 6 The green properties of ultimate strength and flexural modulus increased with mold temperature, reaching a peak value at a mold temperature of 46.67 C 116 F after which they dropped somewhat. Ultimate strain increased uniformly with increasing mold temperature. The linear shrinkage reached a minimum value at a mold temperature of approximately 46.67 C 116 F . Since the Tg of PGA is around 40.0 C 104 F these observations are somewhat related to glass transition behaviour. The flexural and ultimate properties of as molded parts did not show any change until the mold temperature was increased above approximately 82.78 C 181 F . When the higher mold temperature samples were annealed, these properties did not change appreciably. However, the shrinkage during annealing of parts molded with mold temperatures higher than 70.0 C 158 F was very low and within the range of the experimental error. These results are caused by a complex interaction of rates of cooling and crystallization at temperatures higher and lower than the glass temperature which is around 40.0 C 104 F for PGA. Additional differential scanning colorimeter work may give more insight into the mechanism of these changes. However, these changes indicate that higher mold temperatures will yield devices with a negligible degree of shrinkage during annealing. Therefore, higher mold temperatures are recommended to reduce shrinkage and possibly warpage of devices during annealing. The results of part I are shown in the following Tables 1 to 6. Injection molded polyglycolic acid PGA ligating clips were characterized for dimensional stability. The results indicate much improved dimensional stability utilizing a higher mold temperature. An unacceptable breakage rate upon closure approximately 30 persisted despite the mold modifications to eliminate interference. In reducing the overall interference, sacrifices were made in initial clip clamping force to an unacceptable level of about 22.24N 5 lbs . Recommendations to improve the breakage rate and the clamping force are to structurally change the clip design and to utilize a higher mold temperature to minimize dimensional changes during subsequent annealing. A higher mold temperature also allows the clips to be annealed with minimal fixturing. Approximately 300 samples of a ligating clip were injection molded from PGA using the conditions listed in Table 7. While sinking was not apparent, flash problems persisted. The flash problem can be minimized by using a hydraulic molding machine with the proper control on the injection profile. The samples were zylene washed and overnight vacuum dried at room temperature. They were then annealed free standing for 3 hours at 110 C under vacuum, degated, deflashed and packaged for sterilization. Prior to annealing, the overall length of twenty clips was measured and each clip was uniquely identified. The lengths were taken again after annealing. The dimensional changes in overall length for the above procedure are shown in Tables 8 to 10 with the higher mold temperature to limit the dimensional changes during annealing, an overall consistent shrinkage of approximately 0.003048 cm 0.0012 inch from the original 0.9373 cm 0.369 inch length was observed during the annealing process. This result may be contrasted to a 0.0254 cm 0.010 inch shrinkage on cold molded samples. An approximately 90 improvement in shrinkage is obtained by utilizing the higher mold temperature. Radiation sterilization of 2.5 Mrads created no detectable dimensional changes while ETO sterilization resulted in an average overall shrinkage of 0.001778 cm 0.0007 inch , but not with consistency. Within the standard deviation of the data, the shrinkage during ETO sterilization was insignificant. The
