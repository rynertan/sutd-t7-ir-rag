# A disposable feeding bottle.

## Abstract
A disposable feeding bottle comprising a body 1 made from laminar material, flexible or not, which incorporates a teat 7 and is provided with a sealable opening 2 for the inlet of the milk, the teat 7 being incorporated to or moulded with the body 1 , and the inlet opening 2 being optionally sealed by the teat 7 itself, by a closure flap 3 , or by a folding of a body part and in that conventional means 4, 5 for fixing the means which close the opening 2 are provided.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. A disposable feeding bottle characterized in that it comprises a body I made from a laminar material, flexible or not, which incorporates a teat 7 and is provided with a sealable opening 2 for the inlet of the milk, the teat 7 being incorporated to or moulded with the body I , and the inlet opening 2 being optionally sealed by the teat 7 itself, by a closure flap 3 , or by a folding of a body part and in that conventional means 4,5 for fixing the means which close the opening 2 are provided.

## Description
This invention relates to a disposable feeding bottle. A feeding bottle according to the invention is made from a semi rigid laminar material, preferably of the multi layer type having an inert thermoplastic interior and a cellulose exterior, such as a carton, or completely made of a flexible thermoplastic material and the feeding bottle securely incorporates a teat for dispensing the contents and has an opening for the introduction of the liquid which can readily be sealed. As is known, maternalized milk, which constitutes the basis for preparing bottle feed, ferment readily wherefore the bottle should be thoroughly cleaned and sterilized prior to its re use. However, these basic and necessary rules cannot always be fulfilled with the required scrupulousness, presenting a clear risk for the infant. The problem becomes more acute when the infant should be fed outside his normal environment and suitable means for preparing the bottle are not at hand the alternative of having various bottles to overcome the problem of cleaning same is in turn uncomfortable since it implies the carriage of a sufficient number of bottles. Thus, the problem is more acute during the first months of the life of the infant when it should be bottle fed every three hours. The main object of the invention is precisely to overcome the mentioned problems, putting within the reach of the market a disposable feeding bottle which is always ready for use, in perfect hygienic conditions and with a minimal storage volume. This requirement is met by the feeding bottle of the present invention, since due to the nature thereof, it can be folded and packed in a case which guarantees the sterility thereof. The price of the assembly is sufficiently reduced that the acquisition and subsequent disposal thereof does not unfavourably affect the domestic economy, and the possibilities of use thereof are not decreased. According to a practical embodiment of the invention, the disposable feeding bottle comprises a teat securely fixed to the body of the feeding bottle which, made from a semi rigid thermoweldable laminar material, incorporates an inlet opening which can be sealed by means of a flap which closes the opening, thereby ensuring the sealing of an adhesive. According to another practical embodiment of the invention, the bottle comprises a flexible thermoplastic body in which the teat is moulded to the body, the body being provided with an inlet opening which is closed by flattening and then clamping. According to a third embodiment of the invention, the body of the feeding bottle is semi rigid being made from a multi layer material, or is flexible, being made from thermoplastic bag, the liquid inlet opening of the body being sealed by the teat itself. No relevant prior art is known and, therefore, we are faced with a novel arrangement which, due to the practical and advantageous characteristics thereof, constitutes an effective and cheap solution which solves the aforementioned problems simply and advantageously. The described characteristics are represented in the accompanying drawings wherein examples of practical embodiments, which do not limit the scope of the invention, are illustrated. Figures 1 and 2 of the drawings represent a perspective view and a detail of the practical embodiment wherein the teat is securely fixed to the body Figures 3, 4 and 5 illustrate an embodiment in which the teat is moulded to the body Figures 6 and 7 illustrate an embodiment in which the inlet opening is sealed by the teat itself The embodiments represented in Figures 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 can be made from a flexible sheet. A semi rigid sheet is more suitable for the embodiment illustrated in Figures 6 and 7 but not withstanding this the essential characteristics are maintained. Referring to the drawings, it can be seen that the feeding bottle comprises a body I, made from a conventional thermoplastic material or from a semi rigid, multi layer laminar material, for example, of the type used in the packaging of milk. The body 1 is provided with an inlet opening 2 through which the liquid feed is introduced into the interior of the body. Various closure means can be used, as can be seen in Figures 1, 4, 6 and 7. Figure I illustrates a flap 3 which can be retained by a permanent adhesive 4, whileFigure 4 illustrates a clip 5 which determines the closure under pressure of a fold 6, while in accordance with the embodiment illustrated in Figures 6 and 7, the teat 7 itself acts as the seal of the opening. The teat 7, in accordance with the embodiment illustrated in the example of Figure 1, is securely joined to the body 1 while, as can be seen in Figures 3, 4 and 5, the body itself forms the teat 7. It is clear from the drawings and from the references identifying the different parts thereof, that the examples here represented correspond to a single criterion determining the essential constitution of a disposable assembly which is packed under the suitable conditions for its optional use, occupying a minimal space.
