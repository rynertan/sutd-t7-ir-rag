## Description
The present invention relates to novel 2 phenylquinoline derivatives having antitumour and antibacterial activity, to methods of preparing the novel compounds, and to their use as antibacterial and antitumour agents. The present invention also relates to novel compounds useful as intermediates in the preparation of the 2 phenylquinoline derivatives of the invention. In one aspect the present invention relates to the novel class of substituted quinolines represented by the general formula I where each of R₁ and R₂ separately represents H or one of the groups lower alkyl, halogen, CF₃, CN, SO₂CH₃, NO₂, OH, NH₂, NHSO₂R₃,NHCOR₃, NHCOOR₃, OR₃, SR₃, NHR₃ or NR₃R₃ where R₃ is lower alkyl optionally substituted with hydroxy, lower alkoxy or an amino function , or may represent the substitution of an aza N group for one of the methine CH groups in the respective carbocyclic ring, or R₁ may represent, at positions 2 , 3 or 4 only, a phenyl ring optionally further substituted with one of the groups lower alkyl, halogen, CF₃, CN, SO₂CH₃, NO₂, OH, NH₂, NHCOR₃, NHCOOR₃, OR₃, SR₃, NHR₃ or NR₃R₃ where R₃ is lower alkyl optionally substituted with hydroxy, lower alkoxy or an amino function An amino function as substituent of a lower alkyl radical represented by R₃, R₄ and or R₅ may be unsubstituted or, for example, substituted by one or two lower alkyl groups where lower alkyl has the meaning given below , especially by one or two methyl groups. Thus, for example, an amino substituent of a lower alkyl radical represented by R₃, R₄ and or R₅ may be NH₂, NHCH₃ or N CH₃ ₂. A lower alkoxy group as substituent of a lower alkyl radical reprsented by R₃, R₄ and or R₅ has 1 to 5 carbon atoms, and is especially a methoxy group. A heterocyclic radical represented by R₄ and R₅ and the nitrogen atom to which they are attached may, if desired, contain an additional hetero atom and is 5 or 6 membered. An example is a morpholino group. When R₁ R₂, R₃, R₄ or R₅ represent or contain as substituent lower alkyl, the group contains from 1 to 5 carbon atoms. Examples of lower alkyl optionally substituted with hydroxy, lower alkoxy or an amino function include lower alkyl optionally substituted with hydroxy, amino, methylamino, dimethylamino and O methyl. In a NR₃R₃ group the two R₃ substituents may be the same or different, but are preferably the same. A preferred class of compound of the above formula I is that where R₁ represents one of aza, halogen, NO₂, or OCH₃, R₂ represents H, Y represents N CH₃ ₂ and n is 2. The compounds of formula I have antibacterial and antitumour activity, and are useful as antibacterial and antitumour agents. The compounds of formula I form pharmaceutically acceptable addition salts with both organic and inorganic acids. Examples of suitable acids for salt formation are hydrochloric, sulphuric phosphoric, acetic, citric, oxalic, malonic, salicylic, malic, fumaric, succinic, ascorbic, maleic, methanesulphonic.

The compounds of the present invention of general formula I and the acid addition salts and 1 N oxides thereof may be prepared for example by a process which comprises coupling a substituted quinoline of the general formula II where R₁ and R₂ are as defined above and R₆ represents Cl, Br, OC₆H₄ p NO₂, O 1 N benzotriazole , 1 N imidazole, or an O 2 N methylpyridinium salt or the 1 N oxide thereof, with a primary alkyl amine of the general formula III The coupling reaction is desirably performed in an anhydrous solvent e.g. chloroform, dimethylsulphoxide or N methylpyrrolidone, but preferably dichloromethane or dimethylformamide preferably buffered with a tertiary amine e.g. triethylamine . The reaction is conveniently performed at temperatures in the range of from 0 C to 50 C, with the preferred temperature being 20 C. The acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I are prepared by contacting the free base form with an equivalent amount of the desired acid in the conventional manner. The free base forms may be regenerated by treating the salt form with a base. For example, dilute aqueous base solutions may be utilized. Dilute aqueous potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, ammonia, and sodium bicarbonate solutions are suitable for this purpose. The free base forms differ from their respective salt forms somewhat in certain physical properties such as solubility in polar solvents but the salts are otherwise equivalent to their respective free base forms for the purposes of the invention. The primary alkyl amines of the general formula III are known compounds and are commercially available or preparable by methods described in the literature. Examples of such compounds include N,N dimethyl 1,2 ethanediamine N,N dimethylethylenediamine , N,N diethyl 1,2 ethanediamine, N,N dimethyl 1,3 propanediamine, N,N dimethyl 1, 4 butanediamine, N,N dimethyl 1,5 pentanediamine, N 2 hydroxyethyl 1,2 ethanediamine, 2 2 aminoethylamino ethanol , N methyl N 2 hydroxyethyl 1,2 ethanediamine, 2 aminoethylguanidine NH₂ CH₂ ₂NHC NH NH₂, and 3 aminopropionamidine NH₂ CH₂ ₂C NH NH₂. The two last mentioned compounds may be prepared according to P.L. Barker, P.L. Gendler and H.

The compounds of general formula I , and particularly the Examples listed in Tables I and II, have antitumour activity in both The following Table VI gives biological data for the compounds whose physical data has been given in Tables I and II. The abbreviations used in Table VI are Both of these tumour lines were obtained as frozen cell stocks from Mason Research Inc., USA and are passaged intraperitoneally in DBA 25 mice of either sex P388 or subcutaneously in C57BL 65 mice of either sex LL according to the standard methods Groups of six mice Fl hybrids of DBA 2J male x C57BL 6J female were injected intraperitoneally P388 or intravenously tail vein, LL with 10⁶ tumour cells on day 0. When given in this manner, P388 cells grow diffusely in the peritoneal cavity, whereas the Lewis lung cells form distinct solid tumour nodules in the lungs. Antitumour activity is determined by published methods It is clear from the data of Table VI that the 2 phenylquinoline derivatives of general formula I include compounds which are active antitumour agents, giving significant levels of life extension when tested against the P388 leukemia or Lewis lung carcinoma systems when given by intraperitoneal or intravenous injection, respectively, and or significant inhibition of cultured L1210 leukemia cells The compounds also show antibacterial activity specifically compounds The present invention therefore also further provides a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable addition salt or 1 N oxide thereof, for use in the treatment of tumours, and in particular cancers. The present invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions having antitumour activity and comprising at least one compound of general formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt or 1 N oxide thereof, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or diluents. The active compounds may be orally administered, for example, with an inert diluent or with an assimilable edible carrier, or they may be enclosed in hard or soft shell gelatin capsules, or they may be compressed into tablets, or they may be incorporated directly with the food of the diet. For oral therapeutic administration, the active compounds may be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tablets, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers and the like. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1 of active compound. The percentage of the compositions and preparations may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 and about 60 of the weight of the unit. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained. Preferred compositions or preparations according to the present invention are prepared so that an oral dosage unit form contains between about 5 and about 200 milligrams of active compound. The tablets, troches, pills, capsules and the like may also contain the following a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin excipients such as dicalcium phosphate a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and the like a lubricant such as magnesium stearate and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin may be added or a flavouring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen or cherry flavouring. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets, pills or capsules may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavouring such as cherry or orange flavour. Of course, any material used in preparing any dosage unit form should be pharmaceutically pure and substantially non toxic in the amounts employed. In addition, the active compounds may be incorporated into sustained release preparations and formulations. The active compounds may also be administered parenterally or intraperitoneally. Solutions of the active compound as a free base or pharmaceutically acceptable salt can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like , suitable mixtures thereof and vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminium monostearate and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compound in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze drying technique which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile filtered solution thereof. As used herein, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions. It is especially advantageous to formulate parenteral compositions in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for the mammalian subjects to be treated each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. The specification for the novel dosage unit forms of the invention are dictated by and directly dependent on a the unique characteristics of the active material and the particular therapeutic effect to be achieved, and b the limitations inherent in the art of compounding such an active material for the treatment of disease in living subjects having a diseased condition in which bodily health is impaired as herein disclosed in detail. The principal active ingredient is compounded for convenient and effective administration in effective amounts with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in dosage unit form as hereinbefore disclosed. A unit dosage form can, for example, contain the principal active compound in amounts ranging from about 0.1 to about 400 mg with from about one to about 30 mg being preferred. Expressed in proportions, the active compound is generally present in from about 0.1 to about 400 mg ml of carrier. In the case of compositions containing supplementary active ingredients, the dosages are determined by reference to the usual dose and manner of administration of the said ingredients.
