# High efficiency catalyst containing titanium and zirconium and process for polymerizing olefins.

## Abstract
Olefins are polymerized in the presence of a catalyst prepared by reacting trivalent or tetravalent titanium com pounds such as a titanium trichloride or a titanium tetraalk oxide, zirconium compounds such as tri n butoxy zirconium chloride, an organomagnesium component such as di n hexyl magnesium, a halogen source such as ethyl aluminum dichloride and an organo aluminum compound if the halide source or magnesium component does not contain sufficient quantities of aluminum. Polymerization processes em ploying these catalyst compositions do not require conven tional catalyst removal steps in order to provide polymers having suitable color and other physical characteristics and these catalysts produce polymers having broader molecular weight distributions and, at higher zirconium amounts, lower melt indices than do corresponding catalysts without the zirconium compound.

## Description
HIGH EFFICIENCY CATALYST CONTAINING TITANIUM AND ZIRCONIUM AND PROCESS FOR POLYMERIZING OLEFINS This invention relates to a new catalyst composition useful for initiating and promoting polymerization of a olefins and to a polymerization process employing such a catalyst composition. It is well known that olefins such as ethylene, propylene and l butene in the presence of metallic catalysts, particularly the reaction products of organometallic compounds and transition metal compounds, can be polymerized to form substantially unbranched polymers of relatively high molecular weight. Typically such polymerizations are carried out at relatively low temperatures and pressures. Among the methods for producing such linear olefin polymers, some of the most widely utilized are those described by Professor Karl Ziegler in U.S. Patents 3,113,115 and 3,257,332. In these methods, the catalyst employed is obtained by admixing a compound of a transition metal of Groups IVB, VB, VIB and VIII ofMendeleev s Periodic Table of Elements with an organometallic compound. Generally, the halides, oxyhalides and alkoxides or esters of titanium, vanadium and zirconium are the most widely used transition metal compounds. Common examples of the organometallic compounds include the hydrides, alkyls and haloalkyls of aluminum, alkylaluminum halides, Grignard reagents, alkali metal aluminum hydrides, alkali metal borohydrides, alkali metal hydrides, alkaline earth metal hydrides and the like. Usually, polymerization is carried out in a reaction medium comprising an inert organic liquid, e.g., an aliphatic hydrocarbon and the aforementioned catalyst.One or more olefins may be brought into contact with the reaction medium in any suitable manner. A molecular weight regulator, which is normally hydrogen, is usually present in the reaction vessel in order to suppress the formation of undesirably high molecular weight polymers. Following polymerization, it is common to remove catalyst residues from the polymer by repeatedly treating the polymer with alcohol or other deactivating agents such as aqueous base. Such catalyst deactivation and or removal procedures are expensive both in time and material consumed as well as the equipment required to carry out such treatment. Furthermore, most of the aforementioned known catalyst systems are more efficient in preparing polyolefins in slurry i.e., wherein the polymer is not dissolved in the carrier than in solution i.e., wherein the temperature is high enough to solubilize the polymer in the carrier . The lower efficiencies of such catalysts in solution polymerization is believed to be caused by the general tendency of such catalysts to become rapidly depleted or deactivated by the significantly higher temperatures that are normally employed in solution processes. In addition, processes involving the copolymerization of ethylene with higher a olefins exhibit catalyst efficiencies significantly lower than ethylene homopolymerization processes. Recently, catalysts having higher efficiencies have been disclosed, e.g., U.S. Patent 3,392,159,U.S. Patent 3,737,393, West German Patent Application 2,231,982 and British Patents 1,305,610, and 1,358,437.While the increased efficiencies achieved by using these recent catalysts are significant, even higher efficiencies are desirable, particularly in copolymerization processes. These high efficiency catalysts generally produce polymers of relatively narrow molecular weight distribution. It is therefore desirable to have, for some applications such as injection molding, high efficiency catalysts which produce polymers and copolymers having a broader molecular weight distribution and are sufficiently active at solution polymerization temperatures above 1400C to produce high yields of olefin homopolymers or copolymers per unit of catalyst without the necessity of further treatment to remove catalyst residue to obtain a polymer of desired purity. The present invention, in one aspect, is a process for polymerizing olefins under conditions characteristic of Ziegler polymerization in the presence of a catalyst prepared by reacting trivalent or tetravalent titanium compounds such as a titanium trichloride or a titanium tetraalkoxide, zirconium compounds such as tri n butoxy zirconium chloride, an organomagnesium component such as di n hexyl magnesium, a halogen source such as ethyl aluminum dichloride and an organoaluminum compound if the halide source or magnesium component does not contain sufficient quantities of aluminum. More specifically, the catalyst is the catalytic reaction product of A a trivalent or tetravalent titanium compound or mixture of such compounds, B a zirconium compound or mixture of such compounds, C an organomagnesium component and D a halide source. If components C and or D do not contain sufficient quantities of an aluminum compound, then additional quantities of an organoaluminum compound should be added. The magnesium component is 1 a complex of an organomagnesium compound and an organometallic compound which solubilizes the organomagnesium compound or 2 a hydrocarbon soluble organomagnesium compound. The halide source is a non metallic halide corresponding to the empirical formula R X where in R is hydrogen or an active monovalent organic radical and X is halogen.Alternatively, the halide source is a metallic halide corresponding to the empirical formula MR, a wherein M is a metal of Group IIIA or IVA of Mendeleev s PeriodicTable of the Elements, R is a monovalent organic radical, usually hydrocarbyl or hydrocarbyloxy, X is halogen, y is a number corresponding to valence of M and a is a number from 1 to y.The proportions of the foregoing components of said catalytic reaction products are such that the atomic ratios of the elements are Mg Zr is from about 1 1 to about 100 1 preferably from about 2.5 1 to about 50 1 most preferably from about 5 1 to about 25 1 Al Zr is from about 0.1 1 to about 100 1 preferably from about 0.5 1 to about 50 1 most preferably from about 1 1 to about 25 1 Zr Ti is from about 0.1 1 to about 50 1 preferably from about 0.5 1 to about 40 1 most preferably from about 1 1 to about 20 1 excess X A1 is from about 0.0005 1 to about 10 1 preferably from about 0.002 1 to about 2 1 most preferably from about 0.01 1 to about 1.4 1. The excess X is excess halide above that which would be theoretically required to convert the magnesium compound to the dihalide. In view of the reduced activity of conventional Ziegler catalysts in the copolymerization of a olefins, particularly at solution polymerization temperatures, it is indeed surprising that the aforementioned catalytic reaction product is a high efficiency catalyst capable of producing more than a million parts by weight of olefin polymer or copolymer per part of transition metal under such polymerization conditions. Accordingly, olefin polymers produced by this process generally contain lower amounts of catalyst residues than polymers produced in the presence of conventional catalyst even after subjecting such conventionally produced polymers to catalyst removal treatments.Further, these catalytic reaction products provide polymers produced therefrom with a relatively broader molecular weight distribution and, at higher zirconium amounts, a lower melt index than do corresponding catalysts without the zirconium compounds. The catalyst formulations of the present invention are usually a dilute dark brown slurry of very fine particles. The MgCl2 present is a fine, whitish precipitate with a surface area of about 250 m2 gm. The ZrCl4 exhibits a wide range of particle size. If an alcohol is present, the solid ZrCl4 dissolves, presumably to a compound of the general formula Zr OR xCly, with 0 x 4 and 0 y c 4. The exact structure of the Zr Ti catalyst complex is not known. The present invention is most advantageously practiced in polymerization of an a olefin, generally in the presence of hydrogen as a molecular weight control agent, in a polymerization zone containing an inert diluent and the described catalytic reaction product. Especially advantageous is the copolymerization of ethylene and higher a olefins using the catalytic reaction product of this invention. This process is most beneficially carried out under inert atmosphere and relatively low pressure, although very high pressures are optionally employed. Olefins which are suitably homopolymerized or copolymerized in the practice of this invention are generally the aliphatic a monoolefins or non conjugated a diolefins having from 2 to 18 carbon atoms. Illustratively, such a olefins can include ethylene, propylene, butene l, pentene l, 3 methylbutene 1, 4 methylpentene 1, hexene l, octene l, dodecene l, octadecene l, 1, 4 hexadiene, and 1,7 octadiene. It is understood that a olefins may be copolymerized with other a olefins and or with small amounts, i.e., up to about 25 weight percent based on the polymer, of other ethylenically unsaturated monomers such as styrene, a methylstyrene and similar ethylenically unsaturated monomers which do not destroy conventionalZiegler catalysts.Most benefits are realized in the polymerization of aliphatic a monoolefins, particularly ethylene and mixtures of ethylene with up to 50, especially from about 0.1 to about 40, weight percent of propylene, butene l, hexene l, octene l, 4 methylpentene l, 1,4 hexadiene, 1,7 octadiene or similar a olefin or non conjugated a diolefin based on total monomer. As used herein, hydrocarbyl and hydrocarbyloxy are monovalent hydrocarbon radicals. Preferably, hydrocarbyl is alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkenyl and similar hydrocarbon radicals having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, with alkyl having 1 to 10 carbon atoms being especially preferred. Likewise, preferably, hydrocarbyloxy is alkoxy, cycloalkyloxy, aryloxy, aralkyloxy, alkenyloxy and similar oxyhydrocarbon radicals having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, with alkyloxy having 1 to 10 carbon atoms being preferred. Advantageously, the tetravalent titanium compound has the formula TiXn OR 4n n t wherein X is a halogen, particulary chlorine or bromine, R is a hydrocarbyl group having from 1 to 20, preferably from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and n has a value of 0 to 4. Such titanium compounds are preferably derived from the titanium halides wherein one or more of the halogen atoms are replaced by an alkoxy or aryloxy group.Exemplary of such compounds include tetra n butoxy titanium, tetra isopropoxy titanium, di n butoxy titanium dichloride, monoethoxy titanium trichloride, and tetraphenoxy titanium. Suitable trivalent titanium compounds include a and y TiCl3 and the trivalent titanium complexes represented by the empirical formula TiZ3 L X whereinZ is halide, and L is an electron donating compound such as water or an organic electron donor, e.g., alcohol, ether, ketone, amine, or olefin, and x is a whole number from 1 to 6. Usually, the organic electron donor has from 1 to 12 carbon atoms and donates an unshared pair of electrons to the complex. Exemplary electron donating compounds suitably employed include aliphatic alcohols, e.g., isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, n propyl alcohol, butanol and others having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms ethers ketones aldehydes amines olefins, and the like having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms and water.In preferred complexes, Z is chloride or bromide, most preferably chloride, and L is alcohol, especially an aliphatic alcohol having 2 to 8 carbon atoms and most preferably 3 to 6 carbon atoms, such as isopropyl alcohol, n propyl alcohol, n butyl alcohol and isobutyl alcohol. While the exact structure of the complex is not known, it is believed to contain 3 valence bonds to the halide ions and 1 to 6, preferably 2 to 4, coordination bonds to the electron donating compound. In addition to a TiC13, the A, y and ss crystalline forms of titanium trichloride are advantageously employed in the preparation of the complex.Also suitable are titanium tribromide, titanium fluoride and the like. Of the foregoing, the y and a forms of titanium trichloride are preferred. These complexes and their preparation are more fully described byBirkelbach in U.S. Patent 4,120,820. Suitable zirconium compounds are those having the formula ZrXn OR 4 n wherein each R is independently a hydrocarbyl group having from 1 to 20, preferably 1 to 10, carbon atoms, each X is independently a halogen atom, preferably chlorine or bromine, and n has a value from zero to 4. Particularly suitable zirconium compounds include, for example, ZrCl4, ZrBr4, Zr OnBu 4, Zr OnPr 4, Zr OEt 2Cl2, Zr OEt 2Br2, Zr OnPr 2C12, Zr OnPr 2Br2, Zr OiPr 2C12, Zr OiPr 2Br2, Zr OnBu 2Cl2, Zr OnBu 2Br2, mixtures thereof and the like. In the above formulae,Et ethyl, iPr isopropyl, nPr normal propyl, and nBu normal butyl. The zirconium compounds represented by the empirical formula Zr OR xXy wherein 0 x 4 can be prepared in situ by adding a zirconium tetrahalide and an aliphatic alcohol having from 1 to about 20, preferably 1 to about 10, carbon atoms to the catalytic reaction mixture as the zirconium component. The mole ratio of alcohol to zirconium halide is from about 0.01 to about 10, preferably from about 0.25 to about 4. A preferred organomagnesium component is a hydrocarbon soluble complex illustrated by the empirical formula MgR 2 xMR y wherein R is independently hydrocarbyl or hydrocarbyloxy, M is aluminum, zinc, boron, silicon, tin, phosphorous or mixtures thereof, x is about zero to 10, especially from about zero to about 0.25, and y denotes the number of hydrocarbyl groups which corresponds to the valence of M. In order to obtain maximum catalyst efficiency at polymerization temperatures above 180 C, it is desirable to minimize the amount of aluminum in the complex as well as in the total catalyst. Accordingly, for catalysts havingAl Ti atomic ratios less than 120 1, it is desirable to have a Mg Al atomic ratio more than 0.3 1, preferably from about 0.5 1 to 10 1. Preferably the organomagnesium compound is a hydrocarbon soluble dihydrocarbylmagnesium such as the magnesium dialkyls and the magnesium diaryls. Exemplary suitable magnesium dialkyls include particularly n butyl sec butyl magnesium, diisopropyl magnesium, di n hexyl magnesium, isopropyl n butyl magnesium, ethyl n hexyl magnesium, ethyl n butyl magnesium, di n octyl magnesium and others wherein each alkyl has from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Exemplary suitable magnesium diaryls include diphenylmagnesium, dibenzylmagnesium and ditolylmagnesium. Suitable organomagnesium compounds include alkyl and aryl magnesium alkoxides and aryloxides, and aryl and alkyl magnesium halides with the halogen free organomagnesium compounds being more desirable. The preferred halide sources are the active non metallic halides of the formula set forth hereinbefore including hydrogen halides and active organic halides such as t alkyl halides, allyl halides, benzyl halides and other active hydrocarbyl halides wherein hydrocarbyl is as defined hereinbefore. By an active organic halide is meant a hydrocarbyl halide that contains a labile halogen at least as active, i.e., as easily lost to another compound, as the halogen of sec butyl chloride, preferably as active as t butyl chloride. In addition to the organic monohalides, it is understood that organic dihalides, trihalides and other polyhalides that are active as defined hereinbefore are also suitably employed.Examples of preferred active non metallic halides include hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, t butyl chloride, t amyl bromide, allyl chloride, benzyl chloride, crotyl chloride, methylvinyl carbinyl chloride, a phenylethyl bromide, and diphenyl methyl chloride. Suitable metallic halides as set forth by formula hereinbefore are organometallic halides and metal halides wherein the metal is in Group IIIA or IVA of Mendeleev s Periodic Table of Elements. Preferred metallic halides are aluminum halides of the empirical formula A1R3 a wherein each R is independently hydro carbyl as hereinbefore defined such as alkyl, X is a halogen and a is a number from 1 to 3. Most preferred are alkylaluminum halides such as ethyl aluminum sesquichloride, diethylaluminum chloride, ethylaluminum dichloride, and diethylaluminum bromide, with ethylaluminum dichloride being especially preferred. Alternatively, a metal halide such as aluminum trichloride or a combination of aluminum trichloride with an alkyl aluminum halide or a trialkyl aluminum compound may be suitably employed. It is understood that the organic moieties of the organomagnesium compound, e.g., R , and the organic moieties of the halide source, e.g., R and R , are suitably any other organic radical provided that they do not contain functional groups that poison conventionalZiegler catalysts. Preferably such organic moieties do not contain active hydrogen, i.e., those sufficiently active to react with the Zerewitinoff reagent. For ease of catalyst preparation the catalyst is prepared by mixing the components of the catalyst in an inert liquid diluent in the following order 1 the halide source D , 2 the aluminum compound E if necessary, 3 the titanium compound A , 4 the zirconium compound B and 5 the organomagnesium component C . It is understood, however, that any suitable order of addition can be employed as long as the titanium and or zirconium compound is not over reduced by the other catalyst components over reduction is evidenced by a drastic drop in catalyst efficiency or total inactivity of the catalyst . These catalyst components are combined in proportions sufficient to provide atomic ratios as indicated. In cases wherein neither the organomagnesium component nor the halide source contains aluminum, it is necessary to include in the total catalyst an aluminum compound such as an alkyl aluminum compound, e.g., a trialkyl aluminum, an alkyl aluminum halide or an aluminum halide. If polymerization temperatures below 1800C are employed, the atomic ratios of Al Ti may be from about 0.1 1 to about 2000 1, preferably from 1 1 to 200 1.However, when polymerization temperatures above 1800C are employed, the aluminum compound is used in proportions such that the Mg Al ratio is more than 0.3 1, preferably from 0.5 1 to 10 1, and Al Tl ratio is less than 120 1, preferably less than 50 1. The use of very low amounts of aluminum necessitates the use of high purity solvents or diluents and the other components should be essentially free of impurities which react with aluminum alkyls. Otherwise, additional quantities of an organometallic compound as previously described, preferably an organoaluminum compound, must be used to react with such impurities. Moreover in the catalyst the aluminum compound should be in the form of trialkyl aluminum or an alkyl aluminum halide substantially free of alkyl aluminum dihalide. Preparation of the catalyst is preferably carried out in the presence of an inert diluent. The concentrations of catalyst components are preferably such that when the essential components of the catalytic reaction product are combined, the resultant slurry is from about 0.0005 to about 1.0 molar moles liter with respect to magnesium.Suitable inert organic diluents include liquefied ethane, propane, isobutane, n butane, n hexane, the various isomeric hexanes, isooctane, paraffinic mixtures of alkanes having from 8 to 12 carbon atoms, cyclohexane, methylcyclopentane, dimethylcyclohexane, dodecane, industrial solvents composed of saturated or aromatic hydrocarbons such as kerosene, naphthas, etc., especially when freed of any olefin compounds and other impurities, and especially those having boiling points in the range from about 50 to 2000C. Also included as suitable inert diluents are benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, cumene, and decalin. Mixing of the catalyst components to provide the desired catalytic reaction product is advantageously carried out under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen, argon or other inert gas at temperatures in the range from about 1000 to about 2000C, preferably from about 0 to about 1000C. The period of mixing is not critical as formation of the catalyst composition most often occurs within 1 minute or less. In the preparation of the catalytic reaction product, it is not necessary to separate hydrocarbon soluble components from hydrocarbon insoluble components of the reaction product. In the polymerization process employing the aforementioned catalytic reaction product, polymerization is effected by adding a catalytic amount of the above catalyst composition to a polymerization zone containing a olefin monomer, or vice versa. The polymerization zone is maintained at temperatures in the range from about 0 to 3000C, preferably at solution polymerization temperatures, e.g., from about 1300 to 250 C, for a residence time of a few seconds to several days, preferably 15 seconds to 2 hours. It is generally desirable to carry out the polymerization in the absence of moisture and oxygen with a catalytic amount of the catalytic reaction product being within the range from about 0.0001 to about 0.1 millimoles titanium per liter of diluent.The most advantageous catalyst concentration will depend upon polymerization conditions such as temperature, pressure, solvent and presence of catalyst poisons. However, the foregoing range will generally give maximum catalyst yields in terms of weight of polymer per unit weight of titanium. Generally in the polymerization process, a carrier is employed which may be an inert organic diluent or solvent of excess monomer. In order to realize the full benefit of the high efficiency catalyst of the present invention, care must be taken to avoid oversaturation of the solvent with polymer. If such saturation occurs before the catalyst becomes depleted, the full efficiency of the catalyst is not realized.For best results, it is preferred that the amount of polymer in the carrier not exceed about 50 weight percent based on the total weight of the reaction mixture. The polymerization pressures preferably employed are relatively low, e.g., from about 50 to 1000 psig 345 6890 kPa , especially from 100 to 700 psig 689 4820 kPa . However, polymerization within the scope of the present invention can occur at pressures from atmospheric up to pressures determined by the capabilities of the polymerization equipment.During polymerization it is desirable to stir the polymerization recipe to obtain better temperature control and to maintain uniform polymerization mixtures throughout the polymerization zone. In order to optimize catalyst yields in the polymerization of ethylene, it is preferable to maintain an ethylene concentration in the solvent in the range of from about 1 to about 10 weight percent, most advantageously from about 1.2 to about 2 weight percent. To achieve this, when an excess of ethylene is fed into the system, a portion of the ethylene can be vented. Hydrogen can be employed in the practice of this invention to lower the molecular weight of the resultant polymer. For the purpose of this invention, it is beneficial to employ hydrogen in concentrations ranging from about 0.001 to about 1 mole per mole of monomer. The larger amounts of hydrogen within this range are found to produce generally lower molecular weight polymers. It is understood that hydrogen can be added with a monomer stream to the polymerization vessel or seperately added to the vessel before, during or after addition of the monomer to the polymerization vessel, but during or before the addition of the catalyst. The monomer or mixture of monomers is contacted with the catalytic reaction product in any conventional manner, preferably by bringing the catalytic reaction product and monomer together with intimate agitation provided by suitable stirring or other means. Agitation can be continued during polymerization, or in some instances, the polymerization mixture can be allowed to remain unstirred while the polymerization takes place.In the case of more rapid reactions with more active catalysts, means can be provided for refluxing monomer s and solvent, if any of the latter is present, thus removing the heat of reaction. In any event, adequate means should be provided for dissipating the exothermic heat of polymerization. If desired, the monomer s can be brought in the vapor phase into contact with the catalytic reaction product, in the presence or absence of liquid material. The polymerization can be effected in the batch manner, or in a continuous manner, such as, for example, by passing the reaction mixture through an elongated reaction tube which is contacted externally with suitable cooling medium to maintain the desired reaction temperature, or by passing the reaction mixture through an equilibrium overflow reactor or a series of the same. The polymer is readily recovered from the polymerization mixture by driving off unreacted monomer or solvent if employed. No further removal of impurities is required. Thus, a significant advantage of the present invention is the elimination of the catalyst residue removal steps. In some instances, however, it may be desirable to add a small amount of a catalyst deactivating reagent of the types conventionally employed for deactivating Ziegler catalysts. The resultant polymer is found to contain insignificant amounts of catalyst residue and to possess a relatively broad molecular weight distribution. The following examples are given to illustrate the invention. All parts are by molar ratio and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated. The melt index values I2 and Ilo were determined by ASTM D 1238 70 and the density values were determined by ASTMD 1248. The following abbreviations are employed in the examples.

Polymerization Polymerization conditions were identical to those for examples 1 3. Catalyst efficiencies can be found in Table I and polymer properties are listed inTable II. As can be seen in Table II in Examples 1 through 6 and Comparative Experiment A, increasing the level of the zirconium compound in the catalyst while holding all other factors constant leads to a lowering of the melt index from 16.4 gm 10 min. for a catalyst with no zirconium to 4.3 gm 10 min. for a catalyst containing 16 zirconiums. This is unexpected and provides a method of controlling the polymer s molecular weight melt index without adjusting the amount of the normal chain terminator H2 . Examples 7 and 8 again show this unexpected property of melt index lowering when compared toComparative Experiment C. Example 9 and ComparativeExperiment D also show melt index lowering because of the zirconium compound present, but Example 9 has a narrower molecular weight distribution, as evidenced by the I10 I2 ratio, because of the presence of n butyl alcohol in the mixture.
