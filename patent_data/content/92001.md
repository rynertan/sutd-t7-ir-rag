# Method for shaping and finishing a workpiece.

## Abstract
A process of shaping a workpiece comprises applying the surface of the workpiece 18 masking material 22 adapted to protect the surface from etchant. A template 14 having a surface contour comprising a negative image of the surface contour to be formed in the workpiece, and com prised of material adapted to remove masking material 22 is pressed against the surface 18 and then withdrawn to remove masking material 22 from surface portions con tacted by the template. Etchant is then applied and the steps are repeated until the surface contour of the workpiece conforms to the surface contour of the model.
