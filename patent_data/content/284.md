# Process and apparatus for reflowing solder of solder plated substrates and substrates formed thereby.

## Abstract
A process and machine are disclosed for reflowing solder plated continuous flexible circuit webs. During reflow in a vapour environment, the flexible web is maintained in a planar orientation to produce a relatively uniform distribution of solder. Between the chamber 130 containing the vapour 142 and a further chamber 131 containing a liquid 140 exists a liquid vapour interface 137 which provides a seal. Virtually all of the heat transfer fluid used in producing the vapour is recovered and retained.
