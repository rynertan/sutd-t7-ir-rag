## Description
BULK MATERIAL CONTAINERS The present invention pertains to bulk material containers. More particularly, but not exclusively, the invention relates to bulk material containers fabricated from reinforced kraft paper or the like, for transporting and storing bulk materials and having means for dispensing bulk material from the bottom thereof. Paper and paperboard containers are desirably used for transporting and storing materials due to their light weight and low cost as well as their capability of being stored in minimal space in a compact, folded, knockeddown state. For transporting and storing bulk materials, however, the structure of the containers must be sufficiently strong to hold extremely large weights, often of the order of a tonne. Due to the large size and weight of the bulk material placed in the container, it has also been found desirable to construct such containers to permit dispensing of the contents from the bottom, thereby obviating the necessity of tipping the containers to remove the contents. One such bulk material container is known as a sling bin and is manufactured by the St. Regis Paper Company of Nyack, New York. A sling bin is a large open mouthed bag which can be shipped and stored flat, and which can be erected and filled with bulk material while suspended so that the total bin capacity can be utilized.The bin is provided with opposed loops extending upwardly from opposed portions of the bag mouth which are folded back upon themselves and secured to the bag sidewalls to form a pair of slings for suspending the bin from a pair of horizontal supports or the like provided in conjunction with a support frame. Spring clamps attached to the support frame are used to hold the bag or bin mouth open during filling of the bin with bulk material. After filling, the bin can be transported to a storage or unloading site by the insertion of a pair of fork lifts of a forklift truck through the slings. The bin bottom was equipped with a solid paperboard one way slide put in place during the bin construction. Access from one side only was possible and no handle was included. Complete removal of the slide valve or gate is necessary to initiate product withdrawal through a circular opening or hole centered in the bottom of the bin. However, no means were available to vary or stop the flow or removal of the product once the slide valve or gate was removed. According to the invention there is provided a bulk material container characterised by a sidewall, a looped sling extension connected to opposite portions of the sidewall for forming a sling for supporting and transporting the container, at least a double ply bottom wall closing one end of the sidewall, each of the plies of the bottom wall including a dispensing opening therethrough, the dispensing openings being in registration with each other, and slide valve means between the plies of the bottom wall for controlling the rate of flow of bulk material dispensed from the container through the dispensing openings, the slide valve means including a push pull plate having an opening extending therethrough and being capable of being placed in and out of or in partial registration with the registered openings in the plies of the bottom wall, and handle means on each end of the push pull plate for gripping and pushing and pulling the push pull plate from opposite sides thereof. In order to provide control over the rate of flow or discharge of the bulk material from a preferred bulk material container or bin embodying the present invention and described hereinbelow, the bin bottom is provided with a double wall including aligned dispensing openings. The push pull slide valve plate is inserted between the plies or panels of the double wall of the bin bottom and its opening, which is preferably off center, can be placed in registration with the openings in the double wall to dispense the bulk contains of the bin. The flow of material from the bin can be controlled by partial in lieu of full registration of the dispensing openings in the bin bottom and plate.However, if the bin is opened with the slide valve plate too far to one side or with insufficient extension from both sides of the bin bottom wall, the slide valve plate may be inoperable for its intended purpose either because it will be pinched or incapable of being slid axially along the bottom of the bin from one side thereof against the downward force of the great weight and bulk of material housed in the bin, or the slide valve cannot be gripped to be pushed and simultaneously pulled from opposed sides of the bin. Accordingly, the slide valve is provided with handles on both opposite, lateral ends thereof, which are accessible from both sides of the bin when the hole in the slide valve is in registration with the holes in the bin walls.The handles may be cut openings in the slide valve plate or the valve may be doubled back upon itself at its opposite ends and fastened and a dowel inserted through the looped back portion to serve as a handle member. The invention will now be further described, by way of illustrative and non limiting example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein FIGURE 1 is a perspective view of a bulk material container embodying the present invention FIGURE 2 is a perspective view of a slide valve used with the container of FIGURE 1 to dispense bulk material from the container FIGURE 3 is a cross sectional view taken substantially along the plane indicated by line 3 3 of FIGURE 1 FIGURE 4 is a cross sectional view taken substantially along the plane indicated by line 4 4 in FIGURE 3 FIGURE 5 is a perspective view of the container of FIGURE 1 being filled FIGURE 6 is a perspective view illustrating the manner of transporting and dispensing bulk material from the container of FIGIRE 1 FIGURE 7 is a partial perspective view of the bottom of the container of FIGIRE 6, further illustrating the manner in which material is dispensed from the container FIGURE 8 is a partial perspective view of the bottom of the container of FIGURE 1 equipped with an alternative type of slide valve FIGURE 9 is a partial top plan view of the slide valve shown inFIGURE 8 FIGURE 10 is a perspective view of a reinforcing girdle for use with the bulk material container and FIGURE 11 is a perspective view of the bulk material container having the girdle of FIGURE 10 installed thereon. Referring now to the drawings in detail, wherein like numerals indicate like elements throughout the several views, a bulk container or sling bin 10 embodying the present invention can include a bag member 11 having a sidewall 12 provided with looped extensions or slings 14, 16 formed by bending each of the ends of auxiliary sidewalls 13, 14, and bottom wall 18 secured to opposed portions of sidewall 12 and bottom wall 17 of bag 11 respectively, in a loop back upon itself and adhesively securing the loops or slings to the adjacent auxiliary sidewall member. Bag 11 can be constructed of kraft paper, polyethylene, aluminum foil paper laminates, or other materials such as woven fabrics of polypropylene, polyethylene, or other synthetic or natural products. Additionally, a polyethylene liner not shown can be inserted into bag 11 for product protection.The auxiliary sidewalls 13, 15 and bottom wall 18 each contain an inner and outer ply of stiff paper material or woven synthetic fabric, the inner plies being designated 13a, 15a and 18a, while the outer plies are designated 13b, 15b and 18b, respectively. Typical materials which can be used for auxiliary sidewalls 13, 15 and bottom wall 18 are fiber reinforced kraft paper and woven polypropylene. The auxiliary sidewall plies 13a, 13b and 15a, 15b are adhesively bonded to each other, except along bottom wall portions 18a, 18b for a purpose to be described hereinafter. As shown in FIGURE 5, the bin 10 can be supported on a frame 22 by inserting looped extensions or slings 14, 16 on a pair of bars or pipe supports 24, 26, respectively, on frame 22. The bin mouth 25 is opened and spring clamps 28 are all connected between the mouth and frame 22 to hold the mouth 25 open. The combined bottom wall 17, 18 can be supported on a dolly D. The bin 10 can then be filled with bulk material from a tube T and after filling, the bin 10 can be closed and transported to storage or an unloading site by the insertion of a pair of fork lifts 27, 29 of a forklift truck through the slings 14, 16. FIGURE 6 . The bin bottom wall panels 17 and 18a, 18b are provided with registered openings 30, 32, and 41 respectively. Received between unsecured, spaced plies 18a, 18b of auxiliary bin bottom 18 is a slide valve plate 34 having a coating of silicone or polyethylene to reduce sliding friction. In general, slide valve plate 34 can be constructed of any thin material strong enough to hold the bulk material M contained in bag 11 while closed, and to be opened and closed under load. A low coefficient of friction is desired in order to facilitate sliding the valve. Typical materials include heavy duty kraft paper, liner board, synthetic plastic sheets of polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon or polycarbonate, or a laminate or sandwich of any of these materials.The slide valve 34 is provided with openings or handles 36, 38 on both opposite, lateral ends thereof, along with off center opening 40 extending therethrough, which is arranged to be placed into and out of full or partial registration with openings 30, 32 and 41 in bottom wall 17 and plies 18a, 18b to control the flow rate and dispensing of bulk material M from bin 10, as shown in FIGURE 7, from the interior of bin 10, through openings 30, 32, 40 and 41. The handle openings 36, 38, because of the off set nature of opening 40, are accessible from both sides of the bin 10 when the opening 40 in the slide valve 34 is in partial or full registration with the holes or openings 30, 32, and 41 of the bin walls 17 and 18a, 18b. As shown in FIGURES 8 and 9 the handles may be formed by doubling back upon itself the slide valve 34 at its opposite ends and fastening the valve to itself by staples or the like as shown at 42. A dowel 44 inserted through the looped back portion of slide valve 34 aids in gripping slide valve 34 through openings 46 cut in each looped end portion of slide valve 34. Circumferential structural support can be added to bin 10 by providing a girdle 50 around bag 11 and auxiliary sidewalls 13, 15, as shown in FIGURES 10 and 11.Girdle 50 can be constructed of laminated, fiber reinforced kraft paper, or the like and in the form of a sleeve which is installed around the periphery of bag 11 and auxiliary sidewalls 13, 15. Girdle 50 is secured to bag 11 by adhesive means, such as glue spots located at various points on the interior surface of girdle 50. Girdle 50 includes a seam 52 which is adhesively sealed along its length. It has been found that a girdle is useful when bag 11 and auxiliary sidewalls 13, 15 are constructed of paper materials, to add necessary strength to the overall bin assembly. Such a girdle has been found to be unnecessary when bag 11 and auxiliary sidewalls 13, 15 are fabricated from stronger, woven synthetic fabric materials.
