# Process and machine for disintegrating materials.

## Abstract
A process and machine for disintegrating materials wherein the material is delivered to a disintegrating ele ment which receives a reciprocating movement whose path is substantially parallel to the surface to be comminuted wherein the disintegrating element comprises at least one rotary cutter 10 whose axis of rotation 9 is substantially parallel to the surface to be comminuted with a blade 28 having a cutting edge 29 substantially parallel to and di rected transversely to the axis of rotation 9 whereby com minution takes place on simultaneous reciprocation of the disintegrating element and rotation of the cutter 10 .
