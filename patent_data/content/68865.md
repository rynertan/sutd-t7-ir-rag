# Processor facilities for integrated packet and voice switching.

## Abstract
A signal transfer arrangement and method for use in a communication system in which voice and data signals are communicated through the system by a program controlled switching processor 100 . The switching processor reads these signals from an input memory 114 where they were transferred from telephone stations 108, 109 and data termi nals 110, 111, 124, 125 by a scanner 112 . The voice and data signals are transmitted to telephone stations and data termi nals by the switching processor storing these signals in an output memory 116 from which they are retransmitted by a distributor 113 to the telephone stations and data terminals. The intelligent processor 117 reads data signals from the in put memory and assembles these signals into data packets which are temporarily stored in the data memory 119 . Subse quently, the intelligent processor transmits these data packets by storing the data signals in the output memory. The intelli gent processor is controlled by program instructions from its program memory 118 and data stored in the data memory 119 by a parameter processor 122 which has associated program 121 and data 123 memories.
