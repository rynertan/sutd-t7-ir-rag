# Process and intermediates for the preparation of 17alpha hydroxyprogesterones and corticoids from an enol steroid.

## Abstract
17 Substituted 21 hydroxy or 21 acylated steroids are prepared from 20 enol steroids in two steps, the first com prising reaction with peroxymonosulfate ion in a biphasic phase transfer catalysed medium which can give novel 20,21 epoxy corticosteroids , and the second comprising reaction with acid, e.g. acetic acid.
