## Description
INDIPENDENT WHEEL SUSPENSION FOR MOTORVEHICLES. The present invention relates to an indipendent wheel rear suspension for motorvehicles of the kind comprising . A wishbone for each wheel with a substantially transversal oscillation axis, . A torsion bar springing medium for each wishbone, every wishbone being made up of a longitudinal and a diagonal member connected one to the other in proximity of wheel spindle and with their opposite ends hinged to vehiche body. Wheel suspension of this kind are known and largely adopted on the modern motorvehicles. They give the advantage to occupy a limi ted space making easier the installation of fuel tank and spare wheel, and to enable the vehicle rear floor to be lowered. On the other side they bring to rather costly solutions, essentially because of the torsion bar, for its attachments to the wishbone and to the body, and because of the wishbone itself which has to transmit the vertical loads to the bar as twisting moments and has to withstand the torsion given by the moment of the side forces, exerted by the ground against the wheel, with respect of the centroid of the sections of the same wishbone.In addition,the bars of the two wheels must generally be longer than the half track in order to give the flexibility required for the suspension with acceptable stresses and therefore the problem exists of their reciprocal interference, so that it is often necessa ry to adopt different wheelbases between one and the other side of the vehicle. In order to solve these problems, torsion bars have been some times adopted consisting of a leaf spring with rectangular cross section, more often a plurality of leaves, which enable to obtain a sufficient spring rate with a length lower than the half track such solutions also simplify the attachment of the torsion bars to the body and wishbone respectively. A particular solution is proposed by the Swiss Patent n0336703, where a plurality of vertical leaves has sirnultaneously the function of torsion bar and of complete wishbone, able to anchor the wheel in all directions. To obtain this result, a horizontal leaf, suita bly shaped, is added, which is sufficiently rigid to bear the lateral forces. Such solutions, with one or more leaves, are still more expen sive than those with cylindrical torsion bars and therefore they do not have any significant applications on mass production vehicles. The object of the present invention is to avoid these problems and to realize a suspension which gives the same above mentioned advantage of space requirements but without the cost problems invol ved with the bars of traditional kind. The obiect is attained through the invention in that the torsion bar of each wheel consists of a spring leaf with a substantially rec tangular cross section, whose higher side is vertically disposed, said leaf being bent in such a way as to form two branches, one of which is located in a substantially transversal. directionand works as tor sion bar, and the other branch is substantially longitudinal and is connected,directly or through an intermediate member, to the wheel spindle and to the diagonal member of the wishbone, the transversal branch being hingedly connected to the body near its junction with the longitudinal branch, and thus the longitudinal branch, with or without the intermediate member, working as longitudinal mernber of the wishbone, longitudinally anchoring the wheel and transmitting to the leaf transversal branch the twisting moments given by the verti cal loads acting on the wheel, and the wheel being transversally ancho red only by the diagonal member. A further simplification is obtained, with a consequent cost and weight reduction, by eliminating at all the intermediate member and clamping the leaf longitudinal branch directly on the diagonal member and this to the wheel spindle. The invention will now be described with reference to the accom panying figures, of which . Fig.l shows a suspension viewed in plan with a box trailing arm to which the leaf and wheel spindle are fastened, Fig.2 is a transversal view of the same suspension, . Fig.3 shows a variation of the same suspension, with the diagonal member clamped on the longitudinal member, . Fig.4 shows a solution without intermediate member and with the spindle fixed on the diagonal member, . Figs.5, 6 show in detail the central attachment of diagonal member and leaf, Fig.7 shows a possible lateral connection of the leaf to the body. With reference to Fig.1, the transversal leaf, having a rectangu lar cross section with the higer side of the rectangle vertically disposed, is clamped in the vehicle middle through mounting 2 and is bent on both sides in such a way as to form transversal branches 3a, 3b and longitudinal branches 4a, 4b. These latter are clamped by means of bolts 5a, 5b and plates 6a, 6b, on longitudinal members 7a, 7b, which are connected to the body by bubber bushing 8a, 8b and bear, on their opposite ends, wheel spindles 9a, 9b. To the same longitudinal members 7a, 7b, through rubber elements lOa, lOb, two diagonal members lla, llb are connected which, on their opposite ends, are hingedly connected to the body through rubber elements 12a, 12b. The suspension works as follows.The whole of the swinging arm of a wheel, for examlpe the right one, constituted by longitudinal member 7a, longitudinal branch 4a of the leaf, and diegonal member lla, swings about the axis extending through joints 8a, 12a. The vertical loads acting on the wheels are trans mitted to the bodi via longitudinal member 7a, leaf longitudinal branch 4a and therefrom, as twisting moments, to transversal branch 3a.The braking torque is borne by longitudinal member 7a, by vertical reactions of bushing 8a. Ground lateral forces are borne in cooperation by longitudinal member 7a and diagonal member lla. The moments of the same lateral forces with respect to the centroid of member 7a section, that are twisting moments for said member, are transmitted by it to leaf tran sversal branch 3a, which is therefore bending stressed in the vertical plane. Because its rectangular cross section with a high ratio between the two sides, the leaf can easily bear this bending moment while, by suitably fixing the dimensions of its section, the requi red ride rate of the suspension can be obtained with length of trans versal branches comprised within the half width of the vehicle, even with accepteble strains. Fig.2 shows the same suspension in transversal view. In Fig.3, on the contrary, a suspension of the same kind is illu strated wherein the diagonal members are clampedly instead of hingedly connected to the longitudinal members. Thiswaytheresult is obtained of making said diagonal members to bear part of the twisting moments of the lateral forces on the longitudinal members, and consequently the dimensions of these latter can be reduced and hence the total suspension weight. Fig.4 shows the right side of a suspension of the same kind where the longitudinal member is missing. Diagonal member 13 is hingedly connected to the body through bushing 14 and is provided, on the opposite end, with a welded flange 15, to which the wheel spindle and the extremity of leaf longitudunal branch 16 are clamped.Transversal branch 17 is clamped in vehicle middle and resiliently collected to the body in proximity of its junction with longitudinal branch 16, through rubber mounting 18. Under these conditions the suspension operates as follows.The suspension wishbone is practically made up of longitudinal branch 16 of the leaf and diagonal member 13. The wishbone swings by rotating about the axis extending through bushing 14 and mounting 18. The vertical load is transmitted by longitudinal branch 16 to transversal branch 17 as twisting moment. The moment of the lateral loads with respect to the wheel center is absorbed in cooperation by diagonal member 13 and longitudinal branch 16. The braking torque is born directly by longitudinal branch 16. Figs . 5, 6 are two sections of a possible embodiment of the cen tral mounting of the leaf and of two bushings 14, 19 connecting the diagonal mernbers to the body. Plate 20, locked by bolts 21, clamps leaf 22 against braket 23 fastened to the vehicle floor.Outer rings 24, 25 of bushings 26, 27 are welded to the same plate, and bushings inner tubes 28, 29 are fixed to extensions 30a, 30b, 31a, 31b welded to the diagonal members. Fig.7 shows a possible embodiment of lateral resilient mounting of leaf transversal branch. The mounting is made up of a metallic structure 32 xhich contains block 33, bearing the vertical loads transmitted by leaf 22, and two blocks 34a, 34b bearing the horizon tal longitudinal loads. During the suspension deflections the leaf rotates approximately about its section centre, as indicated in plot ted line on the same Fig.7. Of course, the invention, which has been described by way of nonlimitative example, can be varied and modified for increasing the efficiency and reducing the cost of the suspension, without thereby departing from the scope of the present invention.
