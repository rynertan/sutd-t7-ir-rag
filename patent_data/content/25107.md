# Lock valve with variable length piston and hydraulic system for a work implement using the same.

## Abstract
A lock valve 10 for use in a hydraulic system 90 for positioning the work implement of an earth working machine which includes first and second check valves 28, 30 and a piston section 60, 70, 62, 72 for each operable by pilot fluid. In a first mode, the piston sections 60, 70, 62, 72 permit seating of both check valves, while in a second mode, the piston sections interlock so that only one check valve can seat. The lock valve 10 operates in a hydraulic system 90 to lock a work implement, such as a blade for a motor grader, in a fixed position during a first operating mode, while providing a connection from one end of an implement actuator to vent during a second operating mode to insure that a shock absorbing means for the implement hydraulic system main tains a full shock absorbing capacity.
