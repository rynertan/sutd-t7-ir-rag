# Process for preparing butyl p benzoylbenzoates.

## Abstract
Butyl p benzoylbenzoates are prepared by reacting a 4 trichloromethyl benzophenone with a butanol in the presence of an acid catalyst. These butyl p benzoylbenzoates are valuable photoinitiators for the polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers.
