# Method and apparatus for measuring flow.

## Abstract
Flow, and in particular nonuniform flow, as in a vascular system, is measured by applying a stochastic excitation signal to a system inlet which results in a measurable output signal at a downstream system outlet. Flow rate may be extracted by cross correlating the excitation signal and the output signal. Calibration may be effected by conservation of mass principles whereby quantity type parameters are related to concentration type parameters. The stochastic signal has the characteristics of white noise, such that simplified spread spectral detection and signal extraction techniques may be employed to recover the desired intelli gence.
