## Abstract
A method of xerographic reproduction is disclosed wherein a charged translucent imaging member 11 is selectively discharged in the pattern of information bearing indicia on the surface of a document 25 in contact with the imaging member by radiation passing through the member before falling on the document to establish a periodic charge pattern which is subsequently developed with toner parti cles.
