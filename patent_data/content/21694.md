## Description
ADHESIVE COMPOSITIONS PREPARED FROM COPOLYMERS OF MALEIC MONOMERS. The search tor new adhesives having improved performance characteristics, including particularly higher bond strength, is never ending. Another important pursuit is the discovery of new adhesives which do not require use of an organic solvent such as those employed in typical contact cements, e.g., toluene, xylene, benzene, heptane and chlorinated hydrocarbons, which present problems of atmospheric pollution, safety e.g. flamability and recovery costs in commercial uses. Some adhesive studies have investigated combinations of copolymers of maleic anhydride and or maleic acid and a plasticizer. However, such normally solid copolymers have commonly required heating to at least their melting points generally from about 1500 to about 250 C. to render them soluble in the plasticizer, e.g. as disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,077,935 issuedMarch 7, 1978 to W. R. Wszolek. Major disadvantages of the need for such high temperatures include higher energy requirements and unsuitability for home use or economical water based adhesive systems. Accordingly, there is a need for improved adhesive compositions which do not require the use of such high temperatures, and it is an object of this invention to provide such compositions. Another object is new adhesive compositions which do not require the use of organic solvents. Another object is a broad class of new adhesives characterized by unusually high bond strengths. Other objects include adhesive compositions having long shelf life, end use versatility and other desirable characteristics including convenient open times, degree of tack, etc. These and other objects of the invention will be more apparent from the following disclosure and claims in which all parts and percentages are by weight except where noted otherwise. Summary of the Invention In accordance with this invention, the foregoing objects are achieved and novel, att rastive adhesive compositions are prepared by mixing A plasticizer, B normally solid copolymer of olefinically unsaturated monomers of which a substantial proportion are maleic monomers selected from maleic anhydride, derivatives thereof such as, e.g. maleic acid, maleic acid esters, etc. and combinations thereof and C compatibilizer selected from monofunctional compounds which react with at least a portion of the maleic monomers in the copolymer to render the copolymer soluble usually essentially completely in the resulting composition and substantially soluble in the plasticizer component of the mixture at a temperature below the melting point of the copolymer Variations 6f such compositions are conveniently useful as water based, hot melt and or pressure sensitive adhesives which do not require organic solvents and in many embodiments, provide surprisingly high bond strength. Detailed Description bf the Invention As used herein, the term copolymer of olefinically unsaturated monomers refers to polymers of taonomers which polymerize by addition through olefinic bonds, e.g. ethylene, propylene, the butylenes, butadiene, vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, the maleic monomers referred to herein, etc. Copolymers of that kind which are used in this invention are normally solid, preferably have a number average molecular weight MW between about 5,000 and about 100,000, and are typically employed in a finely divided form, e.g. as particles at least about 90 of which have a major diameter smaller than about 100 microns.Such copolymers contain maleic monomers in substantial proportion, preferably between about 30 and about 70 mole percent, although lower or higher mole percentages may be satisfactory in some instances. Even more preferred in many embodiments are copolymers. containing from about 40 to about 60 mole percent maleic monomers.Preferably the remainder of the unsaturated monomers the non maleic monomers in the copolymer are essentially unreactive with the compatibilizer used in this invention, although such reactivity is not intolerable provided it does not interfere to prevent substantial realization of objects of this invention In some pre feed embodiments, the non maleic monomers are essentially devoid of pendant acid e.g. carboxylic acid or anhydride radicals. Thus in many embodiments the non maleic monomers are desirably unsubstituted C1 C4 olefins such as ethylene or propylene, vinyl hydrocarbons such as styrene, vinyl lower C1 C4 alkyl ethers, etc. Combinations of such non maleic monomers may also be used in embodiments in which the copolymer is composed of at least two olefinically unsaturated monomers in addition to the maleic monomers. As used herein, the term maleic monomers includes maleic anhydride and derivatives thereof which do not render the copolymer substantially soluble in the plasticizer used in this invention at a temper ature below the melting point of that copolymer. Such derivatives include maleic acid and maleic acid esters usually half esters such as, e.g. methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, isobutyl and tert butyl esters of maleic acid. In the copolymers used in this invention, there may be present one of such maleic monomers or, in combination, two or more of such monomers. The invention can be carried out using any of various plasticizers in a plasticizing amount, i.e., an amount which provide s satisfactory plasticization of the adhesive composition prior to its end use and adequate flexibility of that composition during such end use. In many embodiments the plasticizer employed is normally liquid i.e., at room temperature although other embodiments are satisfactorily carried out with plasticizers which melt above room temperature but substantially below the melting point of the cbpolymer used in this invention. In each of such embodiments the plasticizer is liquid at the stage of preparation of the compositions of this invention at which the copolymer becomes substantially soluble therein. Although many different plasticizers are suitable, those preferably employed are esters, usually desirably containing at least two ester linkages per molecule.Commonly such plasticizers are selected from phosphates and polycarboxylates. For use in this invention, such esters are desirably aromatic compounds, even more preferably containing at least two aryl radicals per molecule. Polycarboxylate plasticizers useful in this invention include particularly dicarboxylates such as, e.g. phthalates, terephthalates, isophthalates, adipates, succinates, glutarates, sebacates, pimelates, azelates, etc. Preferred are alkyl aryl dicarboxylates, and particularly alkyl beryl dicarboxylates, in which the alkyl radical contains up to about 20 and preferably from about 4 to about 12 carbon atoms, e.g. the branched and normal butyl, amyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl and undecyl benzyl phthalates, adipates, glutarates, succinates, etc.Most preferred are the phthalates, including dialkyl phthalates in which the average carbon atom content per alkyl radical is from about 6 to about 12, e.g. diheptyl, dinonyl, dioctyl or didecyl phthalate and, generally most advantageously, alkyl benzyl phthalates in which the alkyl radical contains from about 4 to about 12 carbon atoms, and variations thereof such as, e.g. 7 2,6,6,8 tetramethyl 4 oxa 3 oxo nonyl benzyl phthalate. Butyl benzyl phthalate is most preferred in many embodiments. The phosphate plasticizers which can be used include triaryl phosphates such as, e.g. isopropylphenyl diphenyl, t butyl phenyl diphenyl, tricresyl, cresyl diphenyl or triphenyl phosphate alkyl diaryl phos phates such as, e.g. Cg Cll 11 alkyl diphenyl, isodecyl diphenyl, 2 ethyl hexyl diphenyl, isooctyl diphenyl, C7 Cg alkyl diphenyl or isononyl dicresyl phosphate dialkyl aryl phosphates such as, e.g. diisodecyl phenyl, di isododecyl t butyl phenyl or di undecyl cresyl phosphate trialkyl phosphates such as, e.g. tributyl, trioctyl or tri C7, 9, 11 alkyl phosphate and variations thereof such as, e.g. tributoxyethyl phosphate.In such phosphates, alkyl radicals directly attached to the phosphate radical each contain preferably from about 4 to about 20, and generally even more desirably from about 8 to about 12 carbon atoms. Aryl groups directly attached to the phosphate radical may be unsubstituted or substituted, e.g. with one or more alkyl substituents each normally containing from 1 to about 8, and usually most desirably about 3 or 4 carbon atoms.Preferred among those phosphates are alkyl diaryl phosphates, particularly t butylphenyl or isopropyl phenyl diphenyl phosphate. The plasticizing esters just described are believed to be essentially non reactive in preparation of the adhesive compositions of this invention. However, reactive plasticizers may also be used. Suitable examples include various monoalcohols such as cetyl alcohol and monoalkyl hydroxy ethers e.g. lower alkyl cellosolves and, usually even more desirably, aryl sulfonamides such as, e.g. ortho and para toluenesulfonamides which may be desirably N substituted with a lower alkyl group such as, e.g. ethyl.In fact, such sulfonamides and similarly reactive plasticizers are used in preferred embodiments of the invention in whichthey serve as at least a portion of the plasticizer as well as at least a portionvof the compatibilizer reactive with the aforedescribed maleic copolymer, the plasticizer in such embodiments of the invention thereby comprising at least a portion of the compatibilizer in those embodiments. An important cdmponent of this invention is the compatibilizer which reacts with at least a portion of the maleic monomers of the aforementioned copolymer to render it essentially completely soluble in the adhesive compositions of this invention and substantially soluble in the plasticizer component of those compositions. The former solubilization converts the copolymer from a solid form to a dissolved constituent of a liquid adhesive and thus makes possible its utility for adhesive applications at temperatures below the melting point of the copolymer.Solubilization of the copolymer in the plasticizer may be essentially complete, e.g. in some of the hot melt adhesive embodiments of the invention, but in other embodiments the copolymer is usually desirably incompletely soluble in the plasticizer such that the resulting adhesive composition is an emulsion, i.e., a liquid mixture having more than one phase. Such emulsions are usually particularly attractive in adhesive applications, and it is an important feature of this invention that adhesive emulsion compositions prepared as described herein are normally very stable, i.e. the phases of the emulsion resist separation on standing of the emulsion for extended periods of time, e.g. up to a week or even longer.This stability of the emulsion compositions of the invention means that such compositions are conveniently useful for many purposes in which they are not used immediately after mixing of their constituents. This feature contributes to a conveniently lengthy open time, i.e., the time after application of the adhesive to a substrate during which it essentially completely retains its adhesive character before contact with the surface to which that first substrate is to be adhered. On the other hand, it has been found that compositions of this invention also typically have or develop optimum tack within a convenient length of time after application to a substrate exposed to the atmosphere. The compatibilizer used in this invention is selected from monofunctional compounds which react with the aforementioned copolymer without resulting in substantial cross linking of the copolymer. Various monofunctional compounds are useful for this purpose, but those usually most suitably employed are selected from water, alcohols such as, e.g. C1 C6 monoalkanols including ethanol, isopropanol and most desirably butanols such as isobutanol, cyclohexanol, diethyl ethanolamine, etc. amides such as, e.g. methyl butyramide, and sulfonamides such as those described hereinbefore organic amines having at least one active hydrogen attached. to the amine nitrogen, e.g. dibutyl amines and propyl amine aldehydes such as, e.g.butyraldehydes enolizable ketones such as, e.g. methyl ethyl ketone and mercaptans such as, e.g. butyl mercaptan. Mixtures of such compounds may be used and in fact, in embodiments employing water and or an alcohol, it may be desirable or even necessary that there be present another compatibilizer compound to bring about the required solubilities of the maleic copolymer in the compositions of this invention.Although the invention is not to be limited in accordance with any theory of its reaction mechanism, it is believed that compatibilizer compounds such as sulfonamides may react differently with maleic monomers of the copolymer depending on whether or not more reactive monofunctional compounds such as, e.g. water, lower alkanols, etc. are present. Although other proportions of the afore described constituents are useful in many instances, the compositions of this invention are usually most satisfactorily prepared using from about 10 to about 30 parts of the copolymer, from about 20 to about 25 parts of the plasticizer and an amount of the compatibilizer sufficient to result in the desired solubilization of the copolymer without exceeding the desired level of its solubility in the plasticizer component. In even more preferred embodiments, from about 15 to about 25 parts of the copolymer are mixed with the proportions of plasticizer and compatibilizer just described.In many embodiments, the plasticizer preferably com prises at least about 10 parts ester of a kind described hereinbefore. When the plasticizer is at least partially of a reactive kind, e.g. an aryl sulfonamide, such a reactive plasticizer is desirably present in at least about 5 parts. In aqueous compositions, water may be present up to about 60 parts or more, and for water based adhesive compositions, the compatibilizer desirably contains at least about 1, and usually even more preferably between about 20 and about 40 parts water. When a lower alkanol or other alcohol is present, e.g. in a hot melt adhesive composition, it is preferably present in an amount between about 1 and about 5 parts.Although tack is generally enhanced by inclusion of plasticizer doubling as compatibilizer, the preferred proportion of reactive plasticzer may be limited in some instances by compatibility of the reacted copolymer with that plasticizer. When a mixture of essentially unreactive plasticizer e.g. alkyl benzyl phthalate and a reactive plasticizer e.g. an aryl sulfonamide is used, the ratio of the former to the latter usually should not substantially exceed about 1 1. On a calculated basis, it is preferred that excess mole equivalents of maleic acid and or anhydride are present in most cases. Using more than about 0.2 equivalents of such excess per 100 grams of copolymer and more than about 508 copolymer in the mixture, hot melt compositions are typically formed.Smaller amounts of excess acid e.g. from about 0.15 to about 0.2 equivalents per 100 grams of copolymer normally provide stable, suitably flowing adhesive compositions. In other embodiments, copolymer blends may be advantageously used. For example, blends of an ethylene maleic anhydride copolymer with a styrene maleic anhydride copolymer normally provide greater compatibility with the plasticizer than the ethylene maleic anhydride copolymer alone and, in some instances, require less plasticizer than the styrene maleic anhydride copolymer alone. Generally, large amounts of alcohol tend to decrease compatibility of the composition and result in a harder adhesive when cured, whereas large amounts of amide tend to favor a softer cured adhesive. Aqueous compositions typically provide good bonding to organic materials, e.g. cellulosics such as Masonite, wood, paper, cotton fabrics, etc.With reference to aqueous compositions containing from about 10 to about 30 parts copolymer, those containing less than about 20 parts water are normally of a gel variety, those containing from about 20 to about 40 parts water flow more readily, and those containing more than about 40 parts water are normally pourable or gunnable. Also generally, the compositions of this invention containing a mixture of reactive and essentially non reactive plasticizers, e.g. an aryl sulfonamide and an alkyl benzyl phthalate, are good hot melt adhesives which provide strong bonds to glass. In such compositions, larger amounts of alcohol usually provide a harder cured adhesive, while larger amounts of amide promote tackiness which makes those compositions suitable as pressure sensitive adhesives. Mixing of the compositions herein may be by F any suitable means including, e.g. Waring blender, air mixer, Cowles dissolver, Myers mixer, etc. The mixing is normally carried out at temperatures substantially below the melting point or range of the copolymer, and usually between room temperature and about l500C. In general, the mixing is satisfactorily carried out between room temperature and 990C. for water based compositions.Temperatures from about 50 to about 1500C. and preferably from about 60O to about 1300C. are typically used for the hot melt adhesive compositions to which little or no water is added. Generally, reaction of the compatibilizer and copolymer is essentially complete at the mixing temperature although if desired, the temperature can be raised following mixing to complete the reaction. Normally mixing times are between about 30 seconds and about two hours, although shorter or longer times may be satisfactory in somme embodiments. Various other conventional adhesive additives may be advantageously included in the compositions of this invention For example, oxides of multivalent metals such as, e.g. iron, zinc, aluminum, tin and particularly antimony provide the cured adhesive with greater adhesion and water resistance. Colorants, fillers, diluents, and various other constituents may also be included, although the plasticizer and reacted copolymer make up normally at least about 20 , and preferably at least about 50 of an adhesive composition of this invention. The following specific examples are for purposes of illustration only and do not imply any limitation on the scope of the invention. In these examples, the following adhesive composition constituents are used Copolymer A A finely divided, particulate 1 1 mole ratio copolymer of .styrene and maleic monomers 0 42 anhydride, 0.064 acid and 0.064 methyl half ester equivalents per 100 g copolymer having a number average MW of 50,000 90 having a major particle diameter smaller than 25 microns . Copolymer B A finely divided, particulate 1 1 mole ratio copolymer of ethylene and maleic anhydride 0.794 anhydride equivalents per 100 g copolymer having a number average MW of 31,000 90 having a major particle diameter smaller than 25 microns. Plasticizer A Butyl benzyl phthalate. Plasticizer B reactive Mixture of N ethyl o and p toluenesulfonamides. Fe2O3 Finely divided filler cross linker 90 having a major particle diameter smaller than 10 microns . Examples 1 15 Copolymers A and B, Plasticizers A and B, water, isobutanol and Fe203 are mixed in a 400 ml glass beaker in the proportions shown in Table I.Mixing is begun at room temperature and continued for 90 minutes, except for Examples 12 15 in which it is begun at 650C. and continued for 1 hour. In each example, the resulting wet composition has good, stable compatibility of constituents. Within 72 hours after mixing, the composition of each example is spread 1 mm thick on the rough side of a 5 cm long end portion of a 5 cm wide strip of 0.63 cm thick Masonite and then compressed with 0.2 kg cm2 force for 2 minutes at room temperature between that end portion and the rough side of a 5 cm long end portion of a parallel identical strip of Masonite.After allowing 24 72 hours more for curing of the adhesives, lap shear strengths are determined on an Instron device in accordance with ASTM Test Procedure D 1002. In the case ofExamples 12 15, duplicate determinations are run with fresh adhesive applied at a temperature between 120 and 1300C., and with adhesive aged one week at 1200C. and then similarly applied. In Examples 12 15, all cured compositions are rubbery and thermoplastic, while those in Examples 8 11 dry hard. Results of the lap shear tests are in Table I. In Examples 1 11, however, the adhesive bonds did not rupture and accordingly, the lap shear results represent breaking strengths of one of the two bonded Masonite strips rather than the ultimate bond strengths which are of greater magnitudes not precisely determined. In addition, the compositions prepared in Examples 12 15 exhibit high adhesion to glass.
