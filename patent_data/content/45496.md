# Flux treated solder powder composition.

## Abstract
Tin alloy solder powder compositions comprising finely divided particles of the alloy coated with a thin continuous layer of organic flux sufficient to lower the electrical conductivity and to obscure the eutectic domains on the surface of the alloy particles.
