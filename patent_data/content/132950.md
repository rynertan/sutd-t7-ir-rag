# Heat exchange tube repairs.

## Abstract
In a method of repairing a defective tube 2 in a tube in shell heat exchanger by inserting a tubular repair sleeve 1 within the defective tube 2 and sealingly bonding one end region of the sleeve to the tube 2 and the other end region of the sleeve to the tube sheet 4 in a manner such that the defect for example a defective tube tube sheet weld 3 is bridged, the improvement of providing a support 7 against which the said one end of the sleeve can be explosively welded to the tube. The support 7 comprises a mass of low melting point alloy cast around the tubes so as to provide support at the welding level for the defective tube 2 as well as surrounding tubes. The support 7 is removed after weld ing by remelting the alloy and causing the liquid alloy to run away. Inserts 8 of high melting point metal can be included in the mass as reinforcement, and the casting can be effected in a removable box 6 fo which the tube sheet 4 forms the base, the walls surrounding at least a part of the tube array which includes the defective tube 2 . Examples of suitable alloys are given.
