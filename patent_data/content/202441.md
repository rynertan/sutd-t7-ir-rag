PharmacologyThe compounds of the invention have been found to exhibit an unpredictably favourable and highly advantagenous degree of activity in the standard classical tst for determining the in vivo affinity for the benzodiazepine receptors, as well as in the standard test considered predictive for pharmaceutical activity against convulsions and anxiety states mediated through the benzodiazepine receptors.The following test has been performed on some compounds of the invention as well as on representative examples of prior art compounds. 1. 3In vivo inhibition of 3H flunitrazepam binding to mouse forebrain membranes by test substances administered intraperitoneally. Procedure 130 Principle. Twenty minutes after a dose of H flunitrazepam H FNM 200 Ci kg i.v. the amount of specific H FNM binding to brain benzodiazepine receptors has reached its maximal value. This specific binding of H FNM can be partly or completely prevented by simultaneous or prior administration of pharmacologically active benzodiazepines and by some benzodiazepine like agents Chang and Snyder, Eur.J.Pharmacol. 48, 212 218 1978 .Test procedure. Suspensions of test substances 2 mg ml are prepared in 58 Duphasol X TM Duphar castor oil ethylene oxide derivative for emulsifying and solubilizing oil and other water insoluble substances by sonification for 10 min.using a Branson B15 microtip ultrasonifier setting 7 .Groups of three mice female, NMR, 18 22 gram are injected with the test substance at 100 mg kg intraperitorially.Fifteen minutes after test substance administration the mice are challenged with 4 Ci intravenously of H FNM 70 90 Ci mole in 200 l physiological saline. Twenty minutes after H FNM administration mice are sacrificed by decapitation, the forebrain rapidly excised within 30 sec and homogenized in 12 ml of icecold 25 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.1, using an Ultra Turrax homogenizer fitted with an N 10 shaft. Two aliquots of 1 ml are immediately filtered throughWhatman GF C glassfibre filters and washed with 2 x 5 ml of the above mentioned buffer. The amounts of radioactivity on the filters are determined by conventional scintillation counting. One group of untreated mice serves as controls.One to three mice are injected with 25 mg kg clonazepam i.p. 30 minutes before 3H FNM to determine the amount of non specific 3H FNM binding, which should be between 8 15 of total binding.When doses of 100 mg kg inhibit more than 50 of specific H flunitrazepam binding test substances are administered in doses, which are factors of 3.16 times lower than 100 mg kg.The ED50 for a test substance is defined as the dose which inhibits 50 of specific H FNM binding. Specific binding is the amount of binding in controls minus the amount binding in clonazepam treated mice.Results. The ED50 value is determined from dose response curves. If only one dose of test substance is administered the ED50 value is calculated as follows, provided that the inhibition of specific binding is within the range of 25 75 1 x 1000ED50 administered dose x g kg Co 1 C where Co is specific binding in controls and Cx is specific binding in mice treated with test substance. II.Pentazol clonic conv. mice i.p. Procedure 400 Principle. Pentylenetetrazol induces clonic and tonic convulsions in mice at doses of 60 120 mg kg s.c. The mechanism is unknown but seems to be due to some effects through the GABA receptor benzodiazepine receptor chloride ionophore complex.Antagonism of convulsiosn induced by maximal doses of pentylenetetrazol is considered predictive for drugs effective against petit mal epilepsia and anxiety.Method. 150 mg kg pentylenetetrazol dissolved in 0.98 NaCl is given by the subcutaneous route in volumes of 15 ml kg to male or female NMRI mice weighing 20 25 g 30 min after an intraperitoneal injection of a test compound. Number of mice exhibiting clonic seizures is noted within the next 30 min. At least 3 doses of each test compound are used with 4 or 8 mice per dose, and with doses both above and below the ED50 value.Results. The ED50 value is calculated as the dose in pg kg at which seizures are inhibited in 50 of the animals using a computer program based on the method of Litchfield and Wilcoxon 1949 . III.Pentazol tonic conv. mice i.p. Procedure 401 Principle. Pentylenetetrazol induces clonic and tonic convulsions in mice at doses of 60 120 mg kg s.c. The meohanism is unknown but seem to be due to some effects through the GABA receptor benzodiazepine receptor chloride ionophore complex. Antagonism of convulsions induced by maximal doses of pentylenetetrazol is considered predictive for drugs effective against petit mal epilepsia and anxiety.Method. 150 mg kg pentylenetetrazol Pentazol, Sigma dissolved in 0.98 NaCl is given by the subcutaneous route in volumes of 15 mg kg to male or female NMRI mice weighing 20 25 g 30 min after an intraperitoneal injection of a test compound. Number of mice exhibiting tonic seizures is noted within the next 30 min. At least 3 doses of each test compound are used with 4 or 8 mice per dose, and with doses both above and below the ED50 value.Results. The ED50 value is calculated as the dose in pg kg where seizures are inhibied in 50 of the animals using a computer program based on the method of Litchfield and Wilcoxon 1949 .
