# Clamp circuit for use in video camera having image pick up device.

## Abstract
A clamp circuit is disclosed, which clamps the black level of output signal of an image pick up section 1 with an optical black detecting portion in the horizontal direction provided in an ineffective picture area corresponding to the horizontal blanking interval of the output signal of the section for each horizontal scanning interval. The pulse width W1 of at least one clamp pulse immediately after the vertical blanking interval is made greater than that W2 of the other clamp pulses, within the horizontal blanking interval.
