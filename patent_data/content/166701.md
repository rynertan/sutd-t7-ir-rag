## Description
An auxiliary safety systeA for tower slewing crane The invention relates to Pd auxiliary safety system for crane and Darticularly for tower crane with horizontal slewing jib, with or without an opposite jib for counter weight, that is to say a system the auxiliary function of which is to give the greatest safety either to both slewing jibs against yieldings of those mechanical members or elements which are provided to maintain them in their horizontal slewing state, and the upper section of the crane tower in its satisfactory slewing motion abort its own vertical axis, also when the component members and elernents are subjected to sudden, unexpected stresses which exceed the limits usually forecast. This upper slewing section of the crane tower is generally mounted on a thrust bearing and Drovid with gear flairs to carry out an efficient slewing motion about its vertical axis, such menbers as well as other component elements e.g. l ck bolts being however subjected to serious drawbacks when the crane structure cannot be main tained in its designed condition.It is certainly well known to the skilled in the art that, for example, in the building field wherein the use of these cranes is very enlarged, great or even fatal accidents are possible because of the limited safety actually reached by machines up to date suggested or applied in accordance with the prior art.Original defects may concern the casting, working, material of the components used to install a crane, e.g. thrust bearing, lock bolts, gear pairs for the slewing motion of the upper section of the crane tower, and relay give rise to accidents. To these original defects it is inportant to add, among other things, the possibility of unexpected, sudden stresses which exceec the limits usually forecast for a normal safe running of all the coponents, either stationary or lovable.in accordance with some statistical data, z more or less consi cerable number of accidents are possible which are due to dif ferent causes. For example during the assembly f a crane 25 by mechanical failures insufficient naintenance and surveillance 19 wind action 16 excessive weight deficiency of the load li,niting device 15, error of the crane operator 15 roadbed sag referred to track travel ling crane 10 On the ground of remarks of this kind, the safety rules relating to the cranes have really been improved, and consequent improvements concerns the materials, technological processes to produce suitable components, as well as the assembly, maintenance and operative features.In spite of these improvements, drawbacks and accidents, which are also very great and fatal, are still possible with cranes manufactured, assembled and operating in accordance with the prior art, particularly when the variations of load and stresses of the crane components are so remarkable and sudden, that wear and strains are possible also within a time course, and give rise to negative or even disastrous results.Those skilled in the art may thus understand that a Invention of possible sources of accidents and drawbacks is very important, because of their connection with the constructive and operative features of tile crane components.One source concerns mechanical failures u ia particularly the yielding of the orientation mechanism of the slewing jib. Such mechanism is generally formed by a horizontally operating crown gear anc one or two pinions driven by a geared motor whose axis is vertical. The coupled members of the mechanism are solid for the stationary and slewing section of the tower, resnectively and a person skilled in the art knows that the one and or the other of these embers are often so stressed by RTI ID 3.16 moments of dif ferent kind, that some deformations are provided which relate, ior example, to the teeth and or lock bolts.Referring to the lock bolts used to as ten component elements of the stationary and slewing tower sections, it is to recall here that they remain in a stressed state after the locking, because of the bending and twisting moments. The bolt shank is moreover iased by variations either of the load and direction of this latter with a slow but continuous deformation, particularly when remankable, sudden variations take place, so that the connecting efficiency of the bolts is actually reduce. It will be understood that in such a condition the verticality of the slewing section cannot be maintained, and the safety of the crane is consequently reduced.Sources of drawbacks and accidents are also the repeated vibrations and stresses during the operative phases of the crane.The invention as claimed is intended to remedy the drawbacks and disadvantages of cranes still now proposed and applied in accordance with the prior art. It solves the problem of how to provide an auxiliary safety system for tower crane with slewing jib jibs, which may also be applied on cranes of the tyDe usual ly used, not expensive modifications of its structure being on ly necessary which are neverthless suitable to give the maxi mal operative safety also for a long ti le. In substance, the claimed auxiliary safety system comprises an auxiliary nears mounted and operating to better Drotect the horizontal slewing jib of a tower crane, the aiai of which is to maybe voic or reduce to not cangereous levels the negative inflence of stresses on the projecting jib, e.g. because of sudden, remarkable variations of load, such auxiliary means providing for the use of ropes suitable to elastically oppose these negative influences an auxiliary means to maintain the slewing section of the cra ne toper in its central position to slew about its vertical axis, that is to say an auxiliary leans capable to allow angu lar deviations of the slewing axis only within tile tolerance limits provided by the designer anc in accordance with the laws such auxiliary mens being formed 5y a protecting cage solid for the stationary section of the crane around the area of a conventional thrust bearing, outwordly the slewing upper section of the tower and extended u to a desired height, a collar being provided at the top end of the cage and solid for same, against the inner perimetrical surface of which and rolling thereon being elastically pushed some rollers mounted on the slewing section of the tower. Dangereous stresses usually supported by the component members which carry out the angu lar motion of the slewing section of the crane tower are in this manner transferred to the stationary section of this latter. One way of carrying out the invention is described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings which illu strate only one sDecific embodiment. That is to say, descrip tion ant illustrations do not constitute a limitation for some other embodiments,and modifications and or changes are then possible within the ground Drinciples of the present invention as pointed out in the claims.In the drawings Fig.l is a schematic elevation view of a tower crane with horizontal slewing jib having an opposite jib to support a conterweight, wherein auxiliary safety means with tension ropes for said jibs any a cc ge for maintaining the central position of the slewing axis are provides in accordance with the invention Fig.2 is a schematic detail of the auxiliary safety means for the slewing jibs of the crane, according to Fig.l Fig.3 is a schematic, partially removed elevation view of the to auxiliary safety means relating the centrality of the slewing section axis, wherein the cage and its top collar are shown with rollers of said t er section in their leaning position on the inner periletrical surface of that collar Fig.4 is a top view of the protective cage and its top collar, the slewing section of the crane tower being illustrated enclosea therein in a cross section with respective rollers.Turning now to the drawings and first of all to Figs.l and 2, it is possible to see that crane 10 selected as an example of embodiment to describe the invention is provided with an o era tive jib 11 id an opposite jib 12 to support a counter eight, substantially as in a conventional tower crane of this tide. Stationary section 13 and slewing section 14 of a trestle tower crane 10 are also of a conventional tyre, ana this latter section 14 has solid for operative jib 11 and opposite counterweight jib 12.In Fig.l the skilled in the art may lso see a schematic show of a cage 16 as auxiliary safety eans in accordance with the invention, the features and function of which will be explained below. Such cage 16 is placed around stationary section 13 of crane tower 10, solid for this latter or forming a single piece with same, and is in any case extended from the area of the thrust bearing 15 of slewing section 14 up to a height considered sufficient to carry out its function in accordance with the inventio. The thrust bearing is not a part of the invention and is then not described here, but indicated only by that nume ral reference 15 between stationary section and slewing section 13 and 14, respectively of the crane tower.The structure of operative jib 11 and jib 12 to support a counter weight has been scbatically shown in Fig.l to evidence the solid connection of same with slewing section 14 of the crane tower, Conventional tension rods 17 and 18 are also shown to support the crane jibs, the features of which must obviously be suitable to ensure the strength against unexpected, sudden stresses for variations of load at the free end 19 of protruding jib 11. Such variations give rise to corresponding variations of moments and are obviously dependent on the distance from the central vertical axis of the slewing upper section 14.Tension rods 17, 18 may be replaced by ension ropes, if desi red, and that which relates to operative jib 11 is evidently much more subjected to additional stresses because of variations of load, the effects of which may be actually dangerous when sudden and remarkable, as said above. The auxiliary safety means for jibs 11 and 12 comprises ropes 20, 21, the function of which is that of elastic tension ropes as the, are connected to and operating through spiral springs to irove the strength condition of the jibs and particularly of the operative jib 11 during any sudden and remarkable variation at its free end 19.Tension ropes 20, 21 have like arranga ent, so that it is suffi ci ent to make reference to tension rope 20 only which concerns jib II, to explain the application anQ function. Referring to Figs.l and 2, at the top of slewing tower section 14 of crane 10 a plate 22 is provided to which one end of both ropes 20, 21 is fastened. On the trestle structure of jib 11, towards the free end of same, and idle rope pulley 23 is mounted, inile a second like pulley 94 is mounted on the upper central part o slewing section 14. A support 25 solid for the jib structure provided with a horizontal threaded through hole wherein a screw 26 is inserted and novable to allow the regulation of elastic tension rope 20 through a tension spiral spring 28.To one end of this latter is hooked the free end of rope 20, while the other end of spiral spring 28 is connected to the corresponding end of screw 26. A nut 27 is provided to define the right elastic tension of rope 20.A person skilled inthe art may easily understand that in this manner such auxiliary safety means for jibs 11 and 12 of a tower crane 10 may carry out an efficient function either through the own features of tension ropes 20, 21 and the selected features of springs 28, as each spring acts as an intermediate elastic means between top plate 22 and the structure of corresDonding jib 11 or 12. The other auxiliary safety means of the system according to the present invention is to be considered as very important rega ding the maintenance of the axis of slewing section 14 in its vertical central position. In accordance with the illustration of Fig.l, such slewing section 14 is still provided with a trestle structure. A more satisfactory application of this auxiliary safety p ans was found by providing for a slight lowering of the botto end of the slewing section 14 in respect to conventional cranes of this type, wherein the connection with stationary section 13 is provided through a thrust bearing 15.In this case such auxiliary safety eans is for led by a cage 16 of a cuadrangular shape like slewing section 14 and stationary section 13, if desired, which in any case must allow the free rotation of slewing section 14 inside sane.As stated above, the aim of this auxiliary safety means is to discharge on the stationary vertical structure of crane 10 those eventual stresses which could damage the co l o zent members said elements carrying out the angular motion of the slewing section about its central vertical axis, and particularly the gear toothings in thrust bearing area as well as the lock bolts provided in the slewing and stationary sections of the crane. By looking through Figs.l, 3 and 4 it is possible to see that cage 16 of this embodiment has a uadrangular shape like slewing section 14 and extends vertically at least from an upper stretch of stationary section 13 up to a height of slewing section 14 which is considered sufficient to reach the desired finality.A top collar 30 is solid for cage 16 and within the inner peri metriccll surface of same the slewing section 14 of crane 10 may freely rotate. As stated above, collar 30 is solid for cage 16 and then for the stationary structure of crane 10, so that it constitutes a very suitable component to discharge thereon tese eventual, unexDected stresses which have a negative effect as regards the safety features of crane 10, either for the operation and stability during a satisfactory period of time. To this end, slewing section 14 of crane 10 is provided with rollers 31 outside the trestle structure, which are rotating freely about vertical axses, for example as shown in Fig.4.To improve the meeting collar 30 rollers 31, each one of these rollers may, in its turn, be mounted on support which allows that radial shift which pushes the roller elastically against the inner perimetrical surface of collar 30 by rolling thereon, in order to continuously maintain ths axis of slewing section 14 and solidly connected jibs 11, 12 in its vertical Dosition, any eventual angular motion in respect to the vertical,referred to the supporting base,being only within the tolerance limits.
