# Tire press unloader.

## Abstract
A tire press unloader for a tire curing press of the up standing bladder type includes a pivoting tire platform 107 mounted for vertical movement on a horizontally movable unloader frame 51 . The platform includes a pivot control member 143 to keep the same from pivoting during initial upward movement and then require the same to pivot dur ing the final vertical movement, The control member also requires the platform to return to its horizontal position as it starts downwardly. Obstructions in the path of the control member require such pivotal movement. The tire platform 107 is mounted on a pivoting horizontal shaft 84 dis posed in vertical slots 80 in the unloader frame and the pivot control member is secured to the shaft for common pivotal movement. When the press is opened and the cured tire has been elevated by the bladder mechanism, the tire platform is positioned beneath the cured tire to support the tire as the bladder is stripped therefrom. The tire platform is then elevated thus vertically to lift the tire over the top of the upstanding bladder to cause the tire to slide down by gravity to a retractable two element centering tire stop. The tire stop is retracted and the tire rolls into a PCI or out of the press.
