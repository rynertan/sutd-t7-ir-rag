# METHOD AND DEVICE FOR SELECTING A CHARACTER SHAPE FOR EACH CHARACTER OF A TEXT, E.G. OF ARABIC, ACCORDING TO FOUR CLASSES

## Abstract
In a character shape selecting device, one of character shapes is selected to provide a character shape sequential expression for each character in 21 of a character sequential expression from a character shape table 18 at a predeter mined timing in each cycle by a combination of the character code in question and a backward linking characteristic in 22 and a forward linking characteristic in 23 of next forwardly and backwardly adjacent independent characters. The charac ter shapes are selected in effect by classifying the indepen dent characters of a character set into three classes in which event, the dependent characters are regarded to be in a fourth class. The independent characters are distinguished from the dependent characters with reference to a dependability stored in a character attribute table 17 together with the backward and the forward linking characteristics for each character of the set.
