# A coalescing device.

## Abstract
In a coalescing device 1 comprising a collecting space 11 for collecting and discharging therefrom sepa rated substances, and comprising a collecting space 6 for collecting and discharging therefrom a carrier medium the danger exists that, when discharging the carrier medium, also some substance to be separated is discharged, and vice versa. This danger can be strongly reduced by provid ing the collecting space 6 with an upper compartment 8 arranged above the coalescer and a lower compartment 7 arranged beneath the coalescer 3 , said compartments 7, 8 communicating 7 with one another through an ample passage 9, 10 whilst shortcircuiting the coalescer 3 .

## Claims

## Description
A coalescing device The invention relates to a coalescing device for coalescing a substance in a mixture of a carrier fluid and of insoluble, particulate substance contained therein comprising a holder, a coalescer arranged in said holder and provided with a coalescence medium and a grating, a mixture inlet for the mixture to coalesce above the coalescence medium in the coalescer, a first collecting space extending in the holder at least below the grating of the coalescer and having a low level carrier fluid outlet and an outlet for light, coalesced substances at a higher level than the carrier fluid outlet, a second collecting space for readily separable, light substances located in the coalescer above the coalescence medium, a flushing medium inlet opening out in the first collecting space, an outlet leading away from the second collecting space for conducting away at least substances from the flushed coalescence medium. Such Ã  coalescing device is known from British patent specification 1,455,692. In this known device the first collecting space located beneath the coalescer is employed for the evacuation of both the coalesced substance emerging from the coalescer and the carrier fluid. It is likely that a comparatively high amount of carrier medium is conducted away through the substance outlet and a comparatively high amount of light, coalesced substance is conducted away through the carrier medium outlet. Moreover, since the separated light substance will stick to the grating, the passage of the mixture through the coalescing medium is impeded so that the substance already coalesced may be readily refined and the efficacious operation of the coalescer is deteriorated. The invention provides a device in which the separation between the coalesced substance to be conducted away and the carrier medium is improved in that the first collecting space comprises an upper compartment arranged above the coalescer and a lower compartment arranged beneath the coalescer, said compartments communicating with one another through an ample passage whilst shortcircuiting the coalescer. When a flushing conduit opens out in the upper compartment provided with an oil sensor, the device is particularly suitable for use as a separator in ships. A ship separator may sometimes temporarily receive a mixture consisting of a very high percentage of oil. This oil can then be directly collected in the upper compartment, sensed and conducted away. For the same reason it is also very advantageous to provide a second oil sensor in the second collecting space. A very compact, preferred embodiment of the coalescing device according to the invention is characterized in that the holder comprises a vertical jacket and the passage is formed by a communication tube arranged centrally in the jacket, whilst the space between the communication tube and the jacket is occupied by the coalescer. The invention will be described more fully with reference to the drawing. The drawing shows schematically in Figure 1 a side elevation of a device in accordance with the invention, Figure 2 a sectional view taken on the line Il Il in Figure 1, Figure 3 a preferred embodiment of the device in accordance with the invention substantially as shown inFigure 1 in the operational phase, and Figure 4 the device of Figure 3 in the flushing phase. The coalescing device 1 for coalescing a substance in a mixture of a carrier fluid and the insoluble, particulate substance contained therein comprises a holder 2, accommodating a coalescer 3 enclosed in a vessel 31 and being filled with a coalescence medium 4, for example, sand and communicating on the bottom side through a grating 5 carrying the coalescence medium 4 with a first collecting space 6 arranged in the holder 2 and comprising a lower compartment 7 disposed beneath the coalescer 3 and an upper compartment 8 disposed above the coalescer 3. The compartments 7 and 8 communicate with one another through an ample passage, since they are interconnected beyond the coalescer 3 by wide tubes 9 and 10.The flow from compartment 7 towards compartment 8 or inversely does not pass thrugh the coalescence medium 4 of the coalescer 3 so that this coalescer 3 is considered to be shortcircuited by said flow. In the coalescer 3, above the coalescence medium 4, a second collecting space 11 is provided for readily separable, light substances. In the second collecting space 11 opens out the mixture feed 12 for introducing the mixture to be coalesced. This mixture feed 12 communicates via closing members 13 and 14 with a mixture supply 15 and an outlet 16 for dirty flushing water respectively. This second collecting space 11 has, moreover, an outlet 17 leading away therefrom for substances such as oil , including a closing member 18.A manometer 20 is connected with the second collecting space 11 for early signalisation of a rise in feed pressure so that a change over from the operational phase shown to a flushing phase can be carried out. With the lower compartment 7 communicates a carrier fluid outlet 24 provided with a closing member 25. In the upper compartment 8 of the first collecting space 6 opens out a flushing water feed 19. From said space leads away the substance outlet 21 provided with a closing member 23 at a level appreciably higher than the low level carrier fluid outlet 24 communicating with the lower compartment 7. The flushing water feed 19 can be connected through the closing member 22 with a flushing conduit or with a mixture feed 15 as shown. In order to remove the separated oil or the oil temporarily supplied in excess sensors 26 and 27 are provided to generate signals for changing over valves 23 and 18 via control members 28 and 29. When the feed pressure increases, the valves 25, 22, 13 and 14 can be changed over manually.Via the signal generator 31 and through the signalling lines 30 a signal may alternatively be given for an automatic change over of these valves from the operational position W as shown to the opposite flushing position S. The embodiment shown in Figures 3 and 4 differs from that shown in Figures 1 and 2 in that a concentric communication tube 32 connects the upper compartment 8 with the lower compartment 7 and in that, for example, the dirty flushing water outlet 16 is coupled through a valve 33 with the substance outlet 17. Figures 3 and 4 show the device in the operational phase and in the flushing phase respectively.A comparison between Figures 3 and 4 clearly shows that the volume 34 of the coalescence medium 4 is larger during the flushing phase than during the operational phase. During flushing the dirt left behind in the coalescence medium 4 during the operational phase and clogging the coalescer 3 is flushed away and fed through the valves 14 and 33 respectively to a post purifier not shown , for example, a plate separator or a settling tank.
