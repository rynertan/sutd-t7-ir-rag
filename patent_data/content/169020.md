## Description
A PROCESS FOR ION IMPLANTATION ACTIVATION IN A COMPOUND SEMICONDUCTOR CRYSTALThis invention relates to a process for ion implantation activation in a compound semiconductor crystal. Multielement compound semiconductor materials have electro optical and carrier transport properties useful in semiconductor devices.However, the multielement crystal responds to the effects of such processing operations as heating in ways that not only affect the location of impurities, but also the stoichiometry of the crystal.Where the crystal surface undergoing processing is a relatively broad area, such as is the case where an integrated circuit is being produced, the conditions must be uniform over the entire surface area in order to assure a yield of uniform devices. One technique of introducing semiconductor property imparting impurities into such multielement compound semiconductor crystals is known as ion implantation. This technique has the advantages of precision positioning, and in the vicinity of room temperature processing but the technique also requires a subsequent annealing step at high tempe ratures which is necessary to repair crystal damage and to activate the implanted impurities. With large scale integration of circuits, the surface area becomes larger and ion implantation activation annealing can result in non uniformity, the major reason being localized loss of the ingredients of the multielement compound semiconductor material. There have been some efforts to control the problem of maintaining uniformity over a multielement compound semiconductor surface when an ion implantation annealing step is employed. For instance, the tendency of the multielement compound semiconductor GaAs to decompose in processing has received some attention in the art. One technique which has been employed to preve decomposition is to apply a capping layer, such as SiO2 over the crystal surface. This technique is suggested in U.S A 4,226,667. Another technique suggested in U.S. A 3,969,164, involves the use of a native oxide of the GaAs. The art has been mainly directed to control of surface stoichiometry. For instance, in U.S. A 4,135,952 an effort is made to keep GaAs from decomposing during ion implantation annealing by placing the GaAs crystal surface in proximity with a GaAs crystal in a Ga solution. The desirability of having an excess of the more volatile element of the GaAs is suggested in U.S. A 4,312,681 wherein InAs is used as a source of excess arsenic to prevent decomposition. The processes suggested in U.S. A 4,135,952 and 4,312,681 require a standard long, about 30 minute, annealing step. In Apt1. Phys. Lett. 38, 815 April 1981, page 639, detrimental effects of diffusion of certain substrate impurities in the materialGaAs during long annealing steps is recognized and high excess As pressure from InAs is employed for control. Processes which employ gallium arsenide wafers as a substrate for the ion implanted gallium arsenide samples are quite beneficial in that they provide a clean, well controlled source of excess arsenic at the interface between the two. However, equal amounts of arsenic leave the substrate and the implanted wafer facing down upon the substrate, such that the excess arsenic benefit is only a factor of 2 which has inherent limits with respect to control of the annealing process. In addition, U.S. A 4,472,206 discloses the ion implantation impurity activation in a multielement compound semiconductor crystal such as gallium arsenide over a broad integrated circuit device area using a short time anneal in the proximity of a uniform concentration of the most volatile element of the crystal in solid form over the broad integrated circuit device area surface. For instance, a gallium arsenide integrated circuit wafer having ion implanted impurities in the surface for an integrated circuit is annealed at temperatures of about 8000C to about 9000C for a time of the order of about 1 to about 20 seconds in the proximity of a uniform layer of solid arsenic. The solid, most volatile element becomes a uniform controlled gas source during the annealing step used to activate the ion implanted impurities permitting a short, of the order of a few seconds, conventional temperature, annealing step. In addition, EP A 108,910 discloses an arrangement for providing the solid arsenic source on a wafer of gallium arsenide by a photoetch technique. The present invention provides a process for uniform ion implantation activation in a multielement compound semiconductor crystal comprising implanting semiconductor property imparting impurities through a device area surface of said crystal placing a major surface of a member in contact with said device area surface of said crystal wherein said member is provided with interstices and annealing the combination of said member and said crystal while confining the vaporization product of said member to said surface. The annealing is preferably a short elevated temperature cycle anneal. The surface of the member can contain the most volatile element and or be covered with a layer containing the most volatile element. The quantity of the most volatile component of the multiple elem t compound such as As in contact uniformly all over the surface of the future circuit area of the implanted wafer when vaporized during the anneal cycle prevents erosion of the elements of the multielement compound e.g., As and Ga , inhibits concentration changes of the most volatile element e.g., As by diffusion, provides excess vapor pressure of the most volatile element e.g., As to drive implanted dopants e.g., Group IV materials onto donor site. How the invention can be carried out will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a flow chart illustrating steps in a process embodying the invention andFigures 2 4 are schematic diagrams of suitable ion implantation sources. In order to facilitate explanation of the present invention, the description will be focused on the particular multielement compound semiconductor material gallium arsenide GaAs . However, the present invention is suitable for the processing of other multiple element compound semiconductor materials such as InP, GaAlAs, and GaInAs. Referring to Figure 1, a flow diagram is provided wherein in Step 1, a multiple element compound semiconductor crystal substrate is implanted with semiconductor property imparting ions in the portion of the crystal that is to be the area of the future integrated circuit.The depth and extent of implantation will vary with the properties being imparted. For instance, silicon ions are introduced by ion bombardment into a crystal GaAs device wafer at energies of about 50 to about 200 12 volts KeV at fluences of about 1012 to about 10 14 kiloelectron volts KeV at fluences of about 10 to about 10 ions per square centimeter and a depth of about 100 nm to about 400 nm. Other commonly employed n type dopants are Se, Ge and S. Examples of p type dopants are Zn, Mn, Mg, Cd, and Be. The implantation energies and fluences vary somewhat depending upon the dopant and the application, but are generally similar to those discussed herein above. In Step 2, the substrate is positioned with the future device area in contact with ion implantation annealing source to provide the uniform, yet controlled, quantity of excess of the most volatile element over the entire surface of the substrate. Reference to Figure 2 illustrates one type of ion implantation annealing source 1. This ion implantation annealing source 1, has a surface 2 provided with interstices 3 and contains the most volatile element of the multielement semiconductor. Preferably, the number and depth of the interstices is such that the projected surface area of the annealing source is at least about 4 times and most preferably about 4 to about 10 times the geometric surface area of the source. Accordingly, an increase of about 4 to about 10 times the amount of excess of the most volatile element such as the As, as compared to the annealing source used and described in U.S. A 4,472,206, is obtained. The source 1 may be a compound semiconductor such as GaAs or InAs used to supply excess As to an implanted GaAs wafer during the annealing. The availability of excess As obtained is greater than would be obtained using a flat or smooth GaAs or InAs source by the ratio of the increased surface area. Reference to Figure 3 illustrates the source 1 having an added extra coating of the most volatile element 4 which further increases the quantity of excess volatile element available. Illustrative of a suitable source is a gallium arsenide or indium arsenide substrate having interstices or having a dendritic surface and having a quantity of the most volatile element of the multielement semiconductor such as the arsenic impregnated within the interstices of the substrate or having a layer coated. Preferably, the amount of the most volatile element of the multielement semiconductor provided on the substrate is the maximum amount that could be present. This provides for the greatest benefits. The gallium arsenide or indium arsenide substrate can be roughened to contain interstices by anisotropic etching of a smooth gallium arsenide or indium arsenide surface. An example of a suitable technique is etching the substrate in potassium hydroxide at about 3000C to about 4000C for about 10 to about 30 minutes. Other techniques, particularly for gallium arsenide, are described in Journal of the ElectrochemicalSociety, Vol. 130, p. 2427, December 1983. A dendritic GaAs or InAs surface can be obtained by the vapor growth of 10 15 microns thick GaAs or InAs layers by metal organic chemical vapor deposition at high rates such as 1 3 microns per minute and at temperatures of 6000C to 7000C. A dendritic surface can also be produced by the vapor growth of aluminium arsenide layers on gallium arsenide or germanium substrates at 600cm to 8000c at rates of 0.5 to 3 microns per minute. Moreover, if desired, the substrate acting as the source of excess volatile element such as arsenic can be other than the gallium arsenide or indium arsenide and includes such substrates as silicon including polycrystalline silicon and amorphous silicon, silicon dioxide, aluminium oxide, germanium, and metals such as tungsten. Layers of GaAs, InAs, or AlAs can be deposited on the desired substrate by chemical vapor deposition as described above. Layers of excess As can also be deposited on the desired substrate. The most volatile element of the multielement component such as the arsenic can be provided onto the substrate by evaporation, sputtering, or vapor deposition techniques. Layers of about 0.1 to about 1 micron thick are preferred. Referring to Figure 4, there is illustrated another example of anAs rich source for annealing purposes. A layer of amorphous or polycrystalline silicon 6 is deposited by chemical vapor deposition or plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition upon a suitable substrate 5 which may be Si, SiO2, Awl203, or tungsten. The layer is deposited in an atmosphere of an As containing species such as arsine AsH3 , and a high quantity of As is contained in the layer. Polycrystalline silicon can contain as much as 6 7 As while amorphous Si can contain as much as 10 20 . When in contact with the implanted wafer and heated, the poly or amorphous Si emits As to supply the desired excess As vapor. The substrate 5 could be processed to produce a layer 6 with a rough surface as 2 in Figure 2. As described in U.S. A 4,472,206, the ion implantation annealing source can include a recess in the backing so that the edges of the backing contact the device area surface and confine the volatile element vapor in a limited controlled volume. In the third step of Figure 1, the short time, conventional temperature, annealing step takes place. The extent of the annealing step will be relative to the depth and extent of the implantation but, compared with conventional processes, greater annealing control, longer cycles, and greater simplicity is achieved. The short time annealing usually takes place for about 2 seconds to about 20 seconds at temperatures between about 9000C and 11000C. While the sources of excess arsenic described hereinabove are particularly useful for short time annealing processes, they are also advantageous as sources of excess arsenic in conventional furnace anneals. For example, gallium arsenide or indium arsenide substrates with roughened surfaces and arsenic containing polycrystalline or amorphous silicon release arsenic atoms over a considerable period of time, allowing them to be used in longer time anneals as well as short time anneals. Such longer time anneals are generally at temperatures of about 8000C to 8500C for periods of about 10 to 20 minutes.
