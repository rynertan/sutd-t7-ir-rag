# System for controlling temperature of molten resin in cylinder of extruder.

## Abstract
A system for controlling a temperature of a molten resin in a cylinder of an extruder includes a plurality of tempera ture detecting elements 4a, 4b, 4c which are disposed in a wall of the cylinder generally in a plane perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the cylinder to detect the temperature of the cylinder. The temperature detecting elements 4a, 4b, 4c are radially spaced by different distances from an inner peripheral surface of the cylinder wall. Detecting devices 4a, 4b, 4c are provided for detecting an ambient temperature of the extruder and the number of revolutions of a screw 20 of the extruder. A microprocessor unit 11 is programmed to be responsive to detecting signals from the temperature detecting elements 4a, 4b, 4c and detecting devices to calculate a proper estimated temperature of the molten resin and to calculate a difference between a desired temperature 25 of the resin and the estimated temperature and to determine in accordance with this difference a set tempera ture of the cylinder wall. A temperature regulating device 5 compares the set temperature with one of the temperatures detected by the temperature detecting elements 4a, 4b, 4c to produce a temperature control signal in response to which the temperature of the portion of the cylinder where the one temperature detecting element is disposed is brought into agreement with the set temperature.
