# Electronic circuit package and method of testing such package.

## Abstract
This invention relates to electronic circuit package and method of testing such package, and deals with the testing of a network of electrical interconnections between chips 20 mounted on an insulating substrate 10 of a circuit module and between the chips and the input and output pins of the module. Each of the mounted chips 20 contains masking circuits which can be activated to prevent signals from the outputs of logic circuits on the chip from being transmitted off the chip and into the interconnection network 11 . Also each of the chips 20 contains emitter follower circuits 40 that logically connect all the chip in put terminals to a common output terminal 23 of the chip. In testing, the mask circuits are activated. Then poten tial levels are selectively applied to a plurality of test points in the interconnection network and differences in potential level between these test points and or between the points and one or more of the common terminals are determined.
