The foamable liquid reservoir is isolated from the air from the air supplying pump. A mixing chamber 53 is provided in which the foamable liquid and air from the air supplying pump can interact to create the foam. A first passage 37,55 leads from the reservoir of foamable liquid to the mixing chamber and a pump 43 is provided for pumping the foamable liquid from the reservoir through the passage to the mixing chamber. A second passage 51 is provided from the air supplying pump to the mixing chamber to introduce air into the mixing chamber.
