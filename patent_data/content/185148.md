# Frangible seal coating and its method of production.

## Abstract
A gas seal between two relatively moving parts is produced by coating one of the parts wih epoxy resin which is then dusted with microspheres having widely varying dia meters. The microspheres are concentrated near the surface of the resin and held in place by a wicking action of the resin on the surface of the microspheres. When the two parts are assembled and moved relative to each other, the microspheres near the surface are broken away to a level which provides a close tolerance gas seal between the two moving parts. The broken microspheres create pockets wnich aid in the sealing process because they provide a change from laminar flow to turbulent flow in the sealing area.
