# Method for producing alpha p isobutylphenyl propionic acid or its alkyl esters.

## Abstract
A method for producing α p isobutylphenyl propionic acid or its alkyl esters which is characterized in that starting materials are inexpensive, processes are easy to be done and products are highly pure. The method comprises the steps of I catalytically cracking 1,1 bis p isobutylphenyl ethane at temperatures in the range of 200 to 650 C in the presence of a proton acid catalyst and or a solid acid catalyst to produce isobutylbenzene and p isobutylstyrene and II reacting said p isobutylstyrene with carbon monoxide and water or alcohol at temperatures in the range of 40 to 150 C in the presence of a metal carbonyl complex catalyst to produce α p isobutylphenyl propionic acid or its alkyl ester or III reacting said p isobutylstyrene with carbon monoxide and hydrogen at temperatures in the range of 40 to 150 C in the presence of a metal complex carbonylation catalyst to produce α p isobutylphenyl propionaldehyde and then ox idizing said α p isobutylphenyl propionaldehyde to produce α p isobutylphenyl propionic acid. The recovered isobuty lene is recycled to produce 1,1 bis p isobutylphenyl ethane by reaction with acetaldehyde in the presence of sulfuric acid.
