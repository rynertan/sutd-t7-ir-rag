# Improvements in or relating to link means.

## Abstract
Link means 1 for connecting two components comprises a pair of axially spaced bushes 2 each adapted for connection to a respective one of said components and an endless band 3 extending between the bushes 2 . Band 3 has side portions 3a disposed on opposite sides of the longitudinal axis of the link means and end portions 3b each disposed around a respective bush 2 . Each end portion 3b is positively secured to the associated bush 2 by wrapping reinforcement material around the end portion 3b and associated bush 2 , preferably in a figure of eight pattern, such that band 3 is capable of transmitting both tension and compression loads between the bushes 2 .
