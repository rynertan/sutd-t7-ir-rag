# Non contact type tonometer.

## Abstract
A non contact type tonometer is disclosed. It has an ar rangement for transfiguring a cornea to be tested by dis charging a fluid to it. This first arrangement comprises a rotary solenoid, a cylinder, and a rotary solenoid driving cir cuit. It also has a second arrangement for detecting the phys ical quantity showing the transfiguration of the cornea. The second arrangement comprises a radiating optical system and a detecting optical system. It also has a circuit serving as a third arrangement for detecting the flow pressure of the fluid which has a correlation with an intraocular pressure. It has a fourth arrangement for establishing a correlation func tion curve between the physical quantity and the flow pres sure of the fluid based on the information from the second and third arrangements, deducing a flow pressure value cor responding to the preset value of the physical quantity from the correlation function curve, and converting such deduced flow pressure value of the fluid to an intraocular pressure value.
