The compounds of formula T exhibit pharmacolo gical activity. In particular, they exhibit sleep inducing activity, as indicated in standard tests. For example in one test according to the principles of A.O. Sayers and G. Stille, Electroenceph. Clin. Neurophysiol. 27, 87 89 1969 , the sleep inducing activity in rats is observed after a single peroral administration of from about 0,5 to about 80 mg kg animal body weight. The compounds are therefore indicated for use as sleep inducing agents. For this use an indicated daily dose is from about 1 to about 100 mg conveniently given shortly before retiring to sleep. Additionally, the compounds of formula I exhibit neuroleptic activity, as indicated in standard tests. For example, in one standard test an inhibition of spontaneous motor activity is observed in mice on p.o. administration of from 1 to 50 mg kg anir,al body weight cf the compounds in accordance with the principles of Caviezel and Baillod Pharm. Acta Helv. 195E , 33, 465 484 The compounds are therefore indicated for use as neuroleptic agents. For this use an indicated daily dose is from about 50 to about 500 mg, conveniently given in divided doses 2 to 4 times a day in unit dosage form containing from about 12.5 to about 250 mg, or in sustained release form. Additionally, the compounds of formula I exhibit antidepressant activity, as indicated in standard tests, for example, by an inhibition of tetrabenazine induced catalepsy and ptosis in rats on intraperitoneal administration of from 5 to 15 mg kg animal body weight in accordance with the method described by Stille Arznei mittel Forsch. 1964, 14, 534 . The compounds are therefore indicated for use as antidepressant agents. For this use an indicated daily dose is from about 5 to about 150 mg, conveniently administered in divided doses 2 to 4 times a day in unit dosage form containing ftom about 1.25 to 75 mg, or in sustained release form. The compounds of formula I may be administered in pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt form. Such acid addition salt forms exhibit the sane order of activity as the frec base forms. The present inven tion also provides a pharmaceutical ccmposition com prising a compound of formula I, in free base form or in pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt form, in association with a pharmaceutical carrier or diluent. Such compositions may be in the form of, for example, a solution or a tablet. The sleep inducing activity and the neuro leptic activity is the preferred utility for compounds of formula I.
