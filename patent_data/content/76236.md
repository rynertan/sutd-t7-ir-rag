# Article of footwear.

## Abstract
A shoe or other article of footwear has an upper 10 , an insole 14 secured at its periphery to the upper and a moulded sole 12 bonded to the insole. At the heel, the edges of the insole and upper meet in a butt joint 32 which is secured by zig zag overstitching so that there are no internal contours rendering the shoe uncomfortable or preventing the heel of the shoe from giving full and uniform support. At the toes, the edges of the insole and upper are turned outwardly 26, 30 and secured together.
