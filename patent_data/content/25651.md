# A SIGNAL CONVERTER CIRCUIT AND NUMERICAL CONTROL APPARATUS HAVING SUCH A CIRCUIT

## Abstract
The converter circuit has n memory elements M1 to Mn. An input signal is fed through terminal IN to the me mory elements M1 to Mn. At a timing instant e.g. t1 ele ment M1 holds the present value e.g. 4 of the input signal and elements M2 to Mn hold the values e.g. 0 of the input signal at n 1 preceding timing instants. The values held in the memory elements M1 to Mn are added in adder ADD , the result divided by n in divider DV , and the divided result fed at an output signal value from output terminal OUT. Where the input signal is a signal indicating a desired amount of movement, of a movable machine part, in nume rical control apparatus, an abrupt change in the input si gnal is converted to a gradual change in the output signal, which facilitates smooth control of the movable machine part.
