## Abstract
There is disclosed an improved temperature responsive pacifier assembly 10 having a liquid medium 36 disposed in an interior chamber 20 , and a temperature responsive ele ment 26 comprised of a spacer strip or element having one or more temperature display dots 30 mounted thereon and formed of a liquid crystal material 32 coated on a colored substrate 34 . The liquid crystal material 32 is responsive to a temperature above about 37 C whereby the liquid crystal ma terial clears to expose the colored substrate 34 thereby visu ally indicating an abnormal temperature condition of a mam mal, and in particular, a homo sapiens, orally utilizing such im proved pacifier assembly.
