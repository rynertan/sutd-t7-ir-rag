# THOUGHT TRIGGERING AND AMPLIFICATION SYSTEM

## Abstract
A set of triggering actions or thought amplification me chanisms are provided for bringing the human mind to an en hanced state of concentration and awareness which is recep tive to unstructured inputs and outputs for findings and exter nalizing solutions and thoughts relating to decision making, problem solving, learning, remembering, creativity, and psy chotherapy. Before receiving the triggering signals, the user is placed in a controlled environment conducive to higher con centration and reinforcement of thought patterns or neuron structure excited by the triggering actions. In a specific em bodiment, a computer is provided for control of the triggering actions, thought amplification and environment, and for con ducting an unstructured question and response dialog with the user for externalizing thoughts which are selectively re corded. Triggering mechanisms may incorporate sound, rhythm, images, repetition, touching, and smell.
