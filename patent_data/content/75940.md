# Process for the manufacture of ethylenediamine.

## Abstract
There is described a continuous process for the manu facture of ethylenediamine from the products of the reaction of ethylene oxide and ammonia, provision of a continuous recycle stream of monoethanolamine to the products of the reaction of ethylene oxide and ammonia, the amination of such products of the reaction of ethylene oxide and ammo nia combined with the monoethanolamine recycle in which the feed stream to the amination reaction zone contains at least 70 weight percent monoethanolamine as well as diethanolamine and triethanolamine, the moles of ammonia provided to the amination reaction exceeds the molar concentration of alcoholic hydroxyl groups present in the amination feed, and the feed to the amination reactor contains at least a 5 increase in the concentration of monoethanolamine over the concentration of monoethano lamine in the reaction product stream from the reaction of ethylene oxide and ammonia.
