# Method for improving the ductility of autogenous welds in unstabilized, ferritic stainless steel coils.

## Abstract
After autogenous welding of coils of straight chromium ferritic stainless steel, the weld area is heated to a temperature within the range of about 1325 to 1515 F 718.3 to 823.9 C and water quenched from an elevated temperature to room tem perature to improve the ductility of the weld area so that during subsequent cold rolling cracking of the weld area is avoided.
