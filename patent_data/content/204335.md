# 2 1H Pyridin ones useful as intermediates.

## Abstract
3 Q 4 R 5 RCO 6 2 di lower alkylamino ethenyl 2 1H pyridinones II or salts thereof, where R is lower alkyl, R is hydrogen or methyl, and Q is cyano are useful as intermediates for preparing 1 R 3 Q 4 R 5 R 1,6 naphthyridin 2 1H ones I or salts thereof, which are useful as cardiotonic agents I, Q is hydrogen, hydroxy, amino, cyano or carbamyl . Processes for preparing the compounds of formula II are shown.
