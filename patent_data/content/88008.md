## Claims
This invention relates to an improvement in the production of 2 4 2 thiazolyloxy phenyl propionic acid. More particularly, this invention provides a process for preparing the above phenylpropionic acid derivative in excellent yield on an industrial scale. Thiazolyloxyphenylpropionic acids are useful compounds showing excellent anti inflammatory and analgesic activities as noted in Japanese Patent Publication No. 1980 37556. Especially, 2 4 2 thiazolyloxy phenyl propionic acid is superior in the above pharmacological activities with low toxicity and the development of it as a medicine has been energetically carried out. The inventors continued to develope a new improved process for the production and reached the process of the present invention. The process has the following advantages in the a methylation of phenylacetic acid easiness of the operation, use of readily available and handeable reagents, reduction of the cost, and the like. There are many processes for preparing analgesics of phenylpropionic acid type being represented by ibuprofen, Senoprofea , and the like. Representative of the proc essesconsists of methylation of phenylacetic acid esters and subsequent hydrolysis of the ester group.. In general, a methyl halide and a base are combined to be used as a reagent for the methylation of the position of phenylacetic acids e.g. methyl iodide and sodium amide, methyl iodide aqnd butyl lithium, and the like. The reagents, however, are not favorable since the bases are expensive and are not easily handled. FUrthermore, it is noteworthy that methyl or ethyl esters of the phenylacetic acid derivatives which cause troubles in isolation and purification of the product after the hydrolysis are used as the starting material in the methylation, Any report has not been issued on the increase of the yield of the product by selection of the reaction conditions and the ester residue. The objective compound, 2 4 2 thiazolyloxy pherXyl propionic acid abbreviated to as objective compound hereinafter can be prepared by a methylation of the corresponding phenylacetic acid derivative. Namely, the corresponding phenylacetic acid ester I is subjected to reaction with methyl halide in the presence of a catalyst of an alkali metal compound to give an w phenylpropionic acid ester II . Ordinary reaction, however, affords a mixture of phenylpropionic acid ester with the starting phenylacetic acid ester unreacted. The separation of these compounds is very hard because of a very small difference in physical properties. Therefore, the obtained product cannot be used as it is for medical purpose in respect of low purity.

A process for preparing 2 4 2 thizolyloxy phenyl propionic acid which comprises hydrolyzing a compound of the formula EMI1.1 wherein R is isopropyl, sec butyl, tert butyl or benzhydryl with 2 6 equivalent moles of sodium hydroxide at a temperature of 0 700C in an aqueous methanol, ethanol or isopropanol.2. A process for preparing 2 4 2 thizolyloxy phenyl propionic acid which comprises reacting a compound of the formula EMI1.2 wherein R is isopropyl, sec butyl, tert butyl or benzhydryl with 1.0 3.0 equivalent moles of methyl bromide in dimethylformamide at a temperature of 5 50C in the presence of 1.0 3.0 equivalent moles of powdered potassium hydroxide and hydrolyzing a compound of the formula EMI1.3 wherein R is the same significance as designated above with 2 6 equivalent moles of sodium hydroxide at a temperature of 0 700C in an aqueoua methanol, ethanol or isopropanol.3. The process claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein 2.5 equivalent moles of sodium hydroxide are used at a temperature of 10 300C in an aqueous methanol consisting of water and methanol at a ratio of 1 2 5 v v .4. The process claimed in claim 1 or 2 wherein 4 equivalent moles of sodium hydroxide are used at a temperature of 15 250C in an aqueous methanol consisting of water and methanol at a ratio of 1 3 v v .3. The process claimed in claim 2 or 3 wherein 1.5 2.5 equivalent moles of methyl bromide and 1.5 2,5 equivalent moles of potassium hydroxide are used at a temperature of 0 Soc. 6. The process claimed in claim 2 or 4 wherein 2.0 2.5 equivalent moles of methyl bromide and 2.0 2.5 equivalent moles of potassium hydroxide are used at a temperature of O 50c. 7. The process claimed in any one of claims 1 6 wherein R is isopropyl, sec butyl or benzhydryl.8. The process claimed in any one of claims 1 6 wherein R is isopropyl. Furthermore, the methyne at the a position of the produced propionic acid ester is readily methylated to give a considerable amout of a by product dimethylated derivative,EMI3.1 acid ester abbreviated to as dimethyl derivative hereinafter when the methylation is continued until the starting phenylacetic acid ester is completely consumed. Separation of the ester of the objective compound from the dimethyl derivative is also difficult. The method cannot yield the product in the desired purity. Additionally, there is no difference between the ester of the objective compound and the above by product in the susceptibility to hydrolysis, and it is still troublesome to separate the objective compound after hydrolysis. Therefore, a methbd for preventing the occurrence of the dimethyl derivative was considered. The method consists of blocking of the methylene group of the acetic acid residue with a cyano or carboxy group to prevent further methylation to the dimethyl derivative, which has been shown in Japanese Patent Publication 1980 37556, practically illustrated in the examples 3 and 4. The method, however, invites a new trouble i.e. cleavage of the ether bond between the thiazole ring and the benzene ring. Obviously, this extra step for protection and deprotection unavoidably invites decrease of the yield. After extensive investigation directed to dissolving the above problem the inventors have developed a new process for preparing the objective compound in high yield by practising the a methylation of phenylacetic acid in the following conditions 1 adopting isopropyl, sec butyl, tert butyl or benzhydryl ester of 4 2 thiazolyloxy phenyl acetic acid 2 using methyl bromide as a reagent for methylation and powdered potassium hydroxide as a base 3 practising the methylation in dimethylformamideE at 5 to 50C and, if necessary, 4 effecting the subsequent hydrolysis of the ester with sodium hydroxide in an aqueous methanol, ethanol or iSopropanol. When the production of the objective compound is practised under the above conditions, a the mono methylation, which does not occur with pellet potassium hydroxide, proceeds smoothly b the formation of the dimethyl derivative, phenylisobutyric acid ester is minimized, and furthermore the methylation can be practised thoroughly without regards to over methylation because the dimethyl derivative can easily be removed at the following hydrolysis step c the dimethyl derivative can easily be removed from the objective compound since the ester residue of the dimethyl derivative is hardly hydrolyzed under such a condition of ester hydro lysis as noted in the above item 4 and d the ether linkage between thiazole ring and benzene ring is not split. Accordingly, the process of this invention provides the highly pure objective compound in excellent yield. Furthermore, the process has many merits such as minimization of multi reaction steps, the simplified operations and use of the inexpensive reagents and no pollution problem. The overall yield of the product by the methylation of the a position and the hydrolysis rises up to approximately 85 ffi when the isopropyl ester is adopted while it is 76.90 ffi when the methyl ester is used. The detail of the process is explained below.The process consists of steps A and B and is illustrated by the following reaction scheme EMI5.1 wherein R is isopropyl, sec butyl, tert butyl or benzhydryl. Step A Isopropyl, sec butyl, tert butyl and benzhydrylester of 2 4 2 thizolyloxy phenyl acetic acid are used the isopropyl, sec butyl and benzhydryl esters are preferred the sSopropyl ester is most preferred. An ester QI of phenylacetic acid is added to a solu tion of powdered potassium hydroxide and methyl bromide in dimethylformamide and is allowed to react at 5 to 50C, preferably at 0 50C. Methyl bromide and potassium hydroxide are used in almost equal moles 1 1 1 0.8, prefera bly 1 1. The ratio of methyl bromide or potassium hydroxide to the phenylacetic acid ester is about 1.0 3.0 equivalent moles, preferably 1.5 2.5 equivalent moles, most preferably 2.0 2.5 . The concentration of methyl bromide in dimethylformamide is 2.0 4.0 M L, preferably 2.5 3.0 M L. The progress of the reaction is checked by high performance liquid chromatography HPLC and the reaction is stopped when the starting compound I disappears. The reaction may usually be finished within about 3 to 6 hours. The product is isolated in the usual manner, for example, by extraction with organic solvents. Step B The ester II of a phenylpropionic acid obtained in the above step A is hydrolyzed in an aquesous methanol1 ethanol or isopropanol in the presence of sodium hydroxide. The ratio of sodium hydroxide to a phenylpropionic acid ester II is about 2 6 equivalent moles, preferably 2.5 4.5 equivalent moles, most preferably 4 equivalent moles. The aqueous alcohol consists of water and an alcohol selected from methanol, ethanol and isopropanol, preferably methanol at a ratio of preferably 1 2 5 v v , especially 1 3. The concentration of sodium hydroxide in water is 11 25 w v , preferably 20 23 ffi w v . The hydrolysis is effected at about 0 700C, preferably 10 300C, most preferably 15 250C.
