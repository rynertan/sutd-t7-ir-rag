# Coupling of chloroperfluoroalkanes.

## Abstract
A process for the coupling of a chloroperfluoroalkane having a CFClâ‚‚ moiety which comprises heating the alkane at a temperature of about 150 to 260 C in the presence of at least about 0.1 times the molar amount each of copper and zinc at a mole ratio of copper zinc from about 2 1 to 1 2. The product is obtained in relatively high yield and conversion.
