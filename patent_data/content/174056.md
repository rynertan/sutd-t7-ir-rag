## Abstract
From a high definition television signal of a field are derived basic pixels whose number is a quarter of the whole number of pixels of an original image, motional areas in the image are detected by comparing the basic pixels in the relevant field with corresponding basic pixels in the preced ing frame, pixels in the motional areas are selected as additional pixels together with information representing positions of additional pixels in the image, and the basic and additional pixels and the position information are transmit ted in time division multiplex mode in such a manner that the basic and additional pixels can be separated from each other at a receiver end without the position information. At the receiver end, when the position information is detected correctly, an image is reconstructed by the received basic and additional pixels under the control of the received position information, whereas when the position information is not detected correctly, an image is reconstructed only from the received basic pixels.
