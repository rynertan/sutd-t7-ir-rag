## Description
TRACING PARAMETER ENTERING METHOD TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a method for entering a tracing parameter into tracer control equipment. BACKGROUND ART In general, tracer control equipment is arranged so as to be capable of selecting the value of each of such parameters as a tracer feed asix direction, a pick feed method, an approach axis direction and so forth within the range of a plurality of discrete values, referred to as format data of parameter, permitting the operator to perform initialization and modification of the parameter value by selecting optimum format data for each of a number of parameters A description will be given, with reference to Fig.1, of a prior art example of a method for entering parameters of this kind. At first, the operator actuates a display to provide thereon displays of names of tracing parameters, such as a reference displacement, a tracer feed rate, etc., and code numbers of the parameters, such as 01, 02, etc., and keys the code number for example, 02 of the tracing parameter desired to enter into an unfilled space of the display screen in the illustrated example at the lower portion of the display screen while observing the displays being provided. By this, format data such as X X Y Y of this tracinq parameter is displayed. Next, when the operator presses an input key after moving a cursor to the position of the format data that is desired to enter, the format data at the cursor is input as a tracing parameter value into a data memory, and at the same time the input pracing parameter value is displayed on the display at a predetermined position corresponding to the code number of this pracing parameter value. With the example described above, however, much time is needed for keying the code number and for moving the cursor, presenting the problem that fast and positive entering of parameters is impossible. An object of the present invention is to provide a method for fast and positive entering of tracing parameters. To attain the above objective, the present invention is constituted so that identification codes of a plurality of tracing parameters are displayed on the display by pressing a tracing parameter input request key, the identification code of the tracing parameer at the cursor is read out of a character memory to identify the tracing parameter related to by the input request the format data of the identified tracing parameter related to the input request are displayed in an unfilled space of the display and by a actuating a selected one of format data select keys arranged corresponding to the array of the displayed format data, the format data corresponding to the position of the actuated format data select key is written as a tracing parameter value into a data memory and, at the same time, it is displayed at a predetermined display position corre sponding to the cursor position. Fig. 2 shows the display screen of the display explanatory of the constitution of the present invention described above. At first, by turning ON the power source of the display, or by pressing a display command key not shown after turning ON the power source of the display, the name such as the refererence displacement of each of a plurality of tracing parameters and its identification code such as an identification number for example, 01 are displayed on the display. Next, the cursor is moved to the position of the identification code of the tracing parameter hereinafter referred to simply as parameter that is desired to enter, and then a parameter input request key not shown is pressed. The display reads out the identification code of the parameter from the address in the character memory that corresponds to the cursor position, identifies the parameter related to the input request and displays the format data X X Y Y of the parameter in the unfilled space of the display screen. Seeing the format data, the operator presses a desired one of format data select keys F1, F2, F3, ... arranged corresponding to the array of the format data. For example, when it is desired to enter the format data X displayed second from left, the key F2 second from left is pressed. Upon detecting the depression of the key F2, the display loads the format data X as an input parameter value into the data memory and, at the same time, displays the input data value at a predetermined display position on the right of the identification number 02 corresponding to the cursor position. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figs. 1 and 2 are disgrams respectively explanatory of a conventional method and an example of this invention method, using the display screen of a display Fig. 3 is a block diagram illustrating the arrangement of an embodiment of the present invnetion and Fig. 4 is a flowchart showing an example of processing by a CPU. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Fig. 3 is a block diagram illustrating the arrangement of a dispaly embodying the present invention. Reference character CPU indicates a processor, MO a program memory, M1 a work memory, M2 a display data memory,M3 a format data memory, M4 a data memory, DI O a digital input output device, DI a digital input device, KBP a keyboard panel and DPL a display unit. In the display unit DPL, reference character CRT designates a cathode ray tube, CM a character memory for storing character data of one picture frame, CAC a character address counter, CLK a clock oscillator, CRTC a control circuit for the cathode ray tube CRT, MPX a multiplexer,CG a character generator, PSC a parallel serial converter,CD character data, W R write read select data, CRD cursor position data, CHC a character clock, DOT a dot clock,W RAD write read address data, RAD read address data, HC a horizontal deflection signal, VC a vertical deflection signal, CRS a cursor display signal and VID a video signal. Fig. 4 is a flowchart showing an example of processing by the CPU. Upon turning ON of the power source of the display, or upon receiving a display command from the keyboard panel KBP after turning ON of the power source, the CPU reads out, by executing a control program stored in the program memory MO, display data stored in the display data memory M2 and writes the name such as the reference displacement and the identification number for example, 01 or like identification code of each of a plurality of parameters into the character memory CM. The contents of the character memory CM are displayed on the cathode ray tube CRT via the character generator CG and the parallelserial converter PSC under control of the control circuitCRTC for the cathode ray tube CRT, as shown in Fig. 2. The operator moves via the keyboard panel KBP the cursor to the position of the identification code of the parameter desired to enter and then presses the parameter input request key. The cursor position data CRD and the input request from the keyboard panel KBP are received by the CPU via the digital input device DI and a bus BUS. Upon receipt of the input request, the CPU sets the content of the character address counter CAC to a value corresponding to the cursor position and, at the same time, switches the write read select data w R for the character memory CM to readout, by which the identification code of the parameter is read out via the digital input output device DI O from the address in the character memory CM corresponding to the cursor position, identifying the parameter related to the input request. Having identified the parameter, the CPU applies via the bus and the digital output device DO to the character memory CM the format data x X Y Y on the abovesaid parameter stored in the format data memory M3 and changes the content of the character address counter CAC to a predetermined unfilled space of the display screen and, further, switches the write read data W R for the character memory CM to write.In this way, the newly written format data are displayed in the predetermined blank space on the cathode ray tubeCRT under control of the control circuit CRTC for the cathode ray tube CRT. Seeing the format data thus displayed, the operator selectively presses the format data select keys F, F2,F3, ... in Fig. 2 arranged corresponding to the array of the format data. For instance, when it is desired to enter the format data X second from left, the select keyF2 second from left is pressed. Having received the selectively switched position data, the CPU writes the corresponding format data into the data memory M4 and, after erasing a character of an address specified by the character address counter CAC, changes the content of the character address counter CAC to a predetermined position corresponding to the cursor position and supplies the character memory CM with the format data written in the data memory M4. By this, format data displayed in the blank space on the display screen is erased and instead the selected format data is displayed as the input parameter value at the predetermined position corresponding to the cursor position, for example, on the right of the identification number, as shown in Fig. 2. While in the above embodiment the parameter identifi .cation numbers are used as parameter identification codes, it is also possible to omit them and to use the names of parameters as their identification codes. Further, the above embodiment has been described in connection with the case where only identification codes of parameters are displayed at the start of the display operation, it is tvident that such an arrangement can also be employed in whic a previously set parameter value, or a typical parameter value of the highest frequency of use among the parameters is read out of the data memory M4 and displayed in addition to the parameter identification codes and those of the parameters which have to be modified are rewritten. The present invention, by virtue of such a constitution as described above, saves the operations of keying parameter identification codes and moving the cursor back and forth unlike the prior art example, and hence it offers a fast and positive parameter entering method.
