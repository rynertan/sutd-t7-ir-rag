# Electron beam irradiation apparatus.

## Abstract
An electron beam irradiation apparatus comprising an electron beam source which is capable of generating elec tron beam and irradiating it in one direction, a first magnet member having a through hole and being disposed allowing the electron beam irradiated from said electron beam source to pass therethrough, a second magnet member which is disposed opposing to the first magnet member through a gap which allows a target to pass therethrough and has the polarity different from that of the first magnet member, a target supporting shifting means which allows the target to pass through said gap and cooling means which cools said both magnet members in which a base material coated with a paste of magnetic particles is used as the target and vertical orientation of the magnetic particles and hardening of the paste can be simultaneously conducted.
