# Engine air fuel ratio sensing device.

## Abstract
An engine air fuel ratio sensing device for measuring the oxygen partial pressure or concentration in the exhaust gas of an engine. The device has a sensor and a control circuit 12 coupled to each other. The sensor consists of a solid electrolyte oxygen pump cell 3 and a solid electrolyte oxygen sensor cell 4 , having a gap d therebetween. The control circuit provides a pumping current through a current limiting resistor Rs to the pump cell and measures two terminal voltages across the current limiting resistor to derive the actual pump current Ip and the internal resist ance R of the pump cell, the latter being converted into the actual temperature T to which the sensor is exposed. The actual pump current and the actual temperature are used to correct the actual pump current to a proper pump current Ipo compensated for the temperature, in accordance with a predetermined equation.
