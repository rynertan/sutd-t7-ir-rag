## Description
LINEAR AND ROTARY DEVICE This invention relates to electromagnetically actuated devices, more particularly actuators or motors of this type which are capable of both linear and rotary drive and especially combined linear and rotary steppers or stepper motors. Rotary stepper motors are widely known and used in various technical fields The common form of such a stepper motor is one that operates in 200 discrete steps, the motor having a toothed.rotor and a stator with poles constructed appropriately for this number of steps. Examples of rotary stepper motors are in U.S. Patents such as Nos 2,93 1,929 2,982,872 3,434,014. Stepper motors that operate in steps are commonly used in connection with digital equipment wherein pulses are applied to the stepper motor which used as an actuator. Linear electromagnetic actuators are also known in the art, such devices embodying linearly movable armature members having teeth which are associated with a stato.r having poles and windings which are energizable to cause the movable member.to move in the direction of its length.An exam ple of such a device is illustrated in U.S. PatentNo, 3,894,275. Devices are known in the prior which are comb√¨nei rotary and linear motors or positioning mechanisms. Illustrative of such devices are the following U.S. Patents 3,394,295 3,430,120 3,441,819 , 3,745,433 3,851,196 and 3,889,165. The latter patent utilizes a cylindrical movable member which has teeth both on the inside and the outside associated with stators having windings so arranged as to produce both linear and rotary movement. All of the prior art devices are lacking in specific effectiveness, capabilities, implicity and compactness of constructional arr.angemeflts whereby to realize efficiency and effectiveness of both the linear and rotary movements. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved linear and rot a ry device. According to the resent invention we provide a linear and rotary device including in combination, a first member having an axis which is movable and which is mounted to be movable angularly about its axis and to be movable axially, said member having means formed on its surface which provide angularly spaced teeth, said last means being constructed so that axially spaced teeth are provided as well as ngularly spaced teeth on the surface of the said member, stator means having poles and including windings and having a circular central opening in which the movable member is disposed so that the sseeth of the movable member can move adjacent to the poles of the stator means, the stator means including poles and windings which are spaced axially, the said stator means being constructed such that energizing certain axially spaced stator windings, the movable member can be caused to move axially and whereby the capability is provided that by energizing stator windings that are angularly displaced from each other the said movable member is caused to rotate about its axis. A preferred form of the invention takes the form of linear and rotary stepper. An elongated cylindric,al movable armature member is provided which is mounted for both axial and angular movement. This member is provided with teeth on its surface, the teeth being arranged in both axial rows and in circumferential aligned rows.Stator means are provided preferably in the form of a plurality of laminated stator members having radial poles with windings associated with individual poles. The construction provides both angularly spaced poles and axially spaced poles, the relationship between the number of stator poles and the number of poles on the movable member being predetermined as described more in detail hereinafter. The arrangement of the windings associated with the stator means is such that axially spaced windings can be energized to cause the movable member or armature to move.axially to a position of minimum reluctance as between its teeth and the stator poles. The arrangement of windings in relation to the teeth on the movable member is further such that angularly spaced windings can be energized in a manner to cause the movable member to rotate about its axis. The device is capable of simultaneous axial and angular movement or so called diving motion. Reference is now made to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a cross s ectional view of a preferred form of the invention Figure 2 is an isometric view illustrating the stator means and the armature or movable member of the devices of Figure Figure 3 is a cross sectional view taken along the line 363 of Figure 1. Referring now to the various figures of the drawing numeral 10 designates a cylindrical housing in which the components of the device are contained. As shown, the housing is cylindrical having an integral end part 12 which has an axial bore 14. Fitting in the other end is an end member 16 the diameter of which at the end is beveled as shown at 17 with the end part of the housing 10 swaged over the bevel as shown at 18. The end number 16 has an axial bore 24. The housing 10 itself has a bore 26. Coaxially mounted in the housing 10 is a movable member or armature 39 of magnetic material. The member 30 is mounted in linear bearings 32 and 34 positioned in the bores 14 and 24. ,Smooth surfaces of the movable member 30 fit inside the bearings so that the movable member 30 is free to move axially as well as angularly. The surface of the member 30 is provided with teeth.The teeth include angularly arranged or aligned teeth such as the teeth as designated at 40 in Figure 3. Six angularly spaced teeth are shown although the number could be different in accordance with teachings of the prior art in connection with known types of stepper motors. There are a plurality of rows of circumferentially arranged angularly spaced teeth as may be seen in Figures 1 and 2. The circumferential rows are equally spaced axially so as to provide axial rows of teeth as well, one of such rows being designated by the numeral 44 inFigure 2. A stator,assembly with windings is provided as shown inthe figures. In the exemplary form of the invention, the stator assembly includes a plurality of laminated stator cores as designated at 50a, 50b and 50c.Each of the stator core units is made up of magnetic laminated material. The stator cores are spaced axially as may be seen in Figure 1 with cylindrical spacer members in between them as designated at 52 and 54 inFigure 1. The configuration of the stator unit 50a is shown more in detail in Figure 3. It has a ring shaped part as designated at 58 with 8 radially positioned poles one of which is designated at 60 in Figure 3. Wound around each of the poles is a stator winding, one of which is designated at 62 in the figures. While the exemplary embodiment is disclosed as having apredetermined number of stator poles and a predetermined number of angularly spaced teeth on the movable member or armature, it should be understood that different numbers and relationships between numbers of stator poles and teeth on the movable member may be provided. To the extent that the movable member can move angularly, it of course can be called a rotor. The relative number of stator poles and rotor teeth for purposes of angular movement can be provided following teachings of the prior art.Similarly the axial spacing between teeth or that is rows of teeth in the circumferential direction may be varied considerably.The inner ends of the poles of the stator form an opening in which the movable member or armature is angularly and axially movable as illustrated in the drawings The peripheral surfaces of the teeth on the movable member 30 movesadjacent to the inner ends of the poles of the stator members . As previously explained, the movable member is mounted in linear bearings to adapt it for both axial and angular movement. With respect to operation, reference will first be made to linear movements. As may be seen in Figure 1 an angular row of teeth on the member 30 aligns with the ends of poles of the stator member which is the stator member SOb at only one position, the angular rows of teethtfit all other positions being misaligned with reference to the inner ends of the end poles of the stator members. The displacement of misaligned, teeth is in the amount of one stepping movement. Windings opposite to each other are in series in a separate circuit constituting a phase. The principle of operation is that the movable member and the poles of the stators.Thus as may be seen if some or all of the windings associated with the stator core 50a are , energized, the. member 30 will move to the,left to a position √∂ f minimum reluctance wherein a ring of ngularly spaced teeth on the member 30 will align with the inner ends of the stator poles of the stator 50a. In a similar manner, member 30 can be caused to translate linearly in the other direction, that is ,to the right. As may be seen, the device is adapted to movement in increments, that is as a stepper, in response to the application of electrical pulses to particular stator windings.Thus the device is adapted in digital systems both from the standpoint of receiving digital inputs and producing digital outputs. In practice, the windings would be controlled by a computer which would select the windings to be energized in order to realize the desired movements including combined angular and linear movement. With reference to angular movements of the movable member 30, reference should be had to Figures 2 and 3. The device also operates angularly on the principle of minimum reluctance. In the position of the device as shown in Figure 3, it will be observed that axial rows of teeth on opposite sides of the member 30 are aligned with stator poles. For pro ducing angular movement stator windings associated with stator poles on opposite sides of the rotor 30 are energized. For example in Figure 3 the windings associated with the poles 60 and 60 could be energized causing the rotor 30 to rotate in a clockwise dire,g,tion to bring teeth on the member 30 into alignment with the poles 60 and 60 .The movement is a stepping movement. Windings might be energized in this manner of only one of the stator assemblies 50 although corresponding windings of more than one of the stator assemblies might be energized at the same time to produce the angular stepping movement. The member 30 moves to the minimim reluctance position. The angular movement and axial movement of the member 30 can be produced simultaneously, this type of movement being known as diving action. Various types of driving circuits may be utilized including circuitry already known in the art. Circuitry for producing only angular movements provides ,pulses to predetermined stator windings as describ in the foregoing, the application of pulses typically being such as to produce angular stepping movements. Axial movement can be produced by driving circuits of types arranged to apply pulses or otherwise to axially spaced windings as referred to in the foregoing. For purposes of producing combined axial and angular movement, by way of example, diametrically opposed windings associated with stator 50a might be energized to cause the member 30 to assume a position of minimum reluctance in both the axial and angular directions. Thus the member 30 will align with energized poles, moving angularly and also moving axially to the position of minimum reluctance. Axial movements in Ohe opposite direction could be obtained by energizing windings of that stator 50c. It will be understood of course that there mightbe any number of stator units with associated windings. Angular movements are realized by energizing selected windings of one or more selected t stator units. Axial movements are realized by energizing windings of the appropriatpstator unit and combined axial and angular movements are realized by selection of windings as described for producing both the angular movement andc the axial movement. In the manner described a computer can select terminals of the fifteen exemplary terminals as referred to in connection with Figure 4 so that the movable member can be positioned to a desired predetermined position by way of axial movements, angular movements, or combined movements. A significant future of the invention is that limit or end pitches are not required with the movable member 30. Illustratively, for example, when the member 30 has moved into a position wherein it presents a smooth surface to the end of the poles of stator unit 5Oa, that stator unit could not cause it to move f urther. This characteristic also makes it possible to and or locate the position of the movable member 30 when control is in response to a computer in the event and the computer should lose its memory.The position of the movable member 30 is locatable in the manner escribed for example, that is by inserting pulses until itvis in a position where it is no longer movable in response to stator 50razz In the schematic illustration shown two more steps would be possible by control of stators 50b and 50c. From the foregoing, those skilled in the art will understand the nature and construction of the invention and the manner in which it achieves and realizes the objectives set forth in the foregoing. Synergism is present in the combination in that movements of the movable member can be realized which cannot otherwise be realized by individual parts of the combination. Combined linear and rotary movements are different than either linear or rotary movements per se, and provided function which can readily be made responsive to computer control not otherwise available. The foregoing disclosure is representative ofa preferred embodiment, it being realized that many equivalent variations are possible, particularly as respects the numbers of teeth angularily and axially, the relative numbers of poles on the stators, the relative positioning of the stators, etc.
