## Description
This invention relates to a fire barrier and more particularly to a fire resistant laminate for retarding flame spread and flame penetration. DE A 25 22 515 discloses magnesium oxide cement which, after curing, results in a crack free, low shrinkage plate material and surface coating material, as well as a laminate material containing said cured mass and a core material. Although natural wood as a material of construction has many desirable properties, some of its short comings, such as its lack of strength in thin layers, and its inherent combustibility, have restricted the scope of its application. The economic necessity of utilizing waste subproducts, and the notable product improvement in strength and appearance has led to the widespread use of laminated wood products in the form of plywood, wood panelling, and veneers, such as doorskin, as well as veneer covered compressed particle and waferboard. Construction and industrial plywoods are widely used for floor, wall and roof sheathing decorative hardwood plywood is used for interior panelling as well as for furniture and many specialty applications. The 1984 edition of U.S. Industrial Outlook reported that the market for wood panel products in 1983 reached 6.6 billion, of which the industrial softwood panels represented 65 of the shipments hardwood panels represented 25 , and particleboard held 10 of the market. 2.4.10⁸m² 2.60 Billion square feet surface measure of hardwood plywood was produced in the U.S.A. in 1983, versus 3.6.10⁸m² 3.9 billion squar feet in 1977 a reduction of 33 , while an additional 1.37.10⁸m² 1.48 billion square feet were imported. Softwood plywood volumes far exceed those of hardwood plywood viz. over 1.86.10⁹m² 20 billion square feet per year. If one of the major drawbacks to the use of plywood its flammability could be economically counteracted without necessitating the use of claddings, fire resistive gypsum wallboard shielding, or space isolation, now required by construction codes, the market and applications for plywood would be further extended. Plywood and panelling is manufactured by bonding together layers plies of thin sheets of wood veneer . The layers are glued together with the grain direction of adjacent layers at right angles. The veneer is usually rotary peeled from logs, but may also be sliced or sawn. After trimming, drying and grading, the veneers go to glue spreaders, where adhesive is applied and the plywood panel is laid up. The plywood is generally hot pressed in large multiopening heated hydraulic presses. The application of both heat and pressure cures the glue. Construction and industrial softwood plywood is made in two types Interior and exterior, on the basis of resistance of the panels to moisture, and in thicknesses ranging from 6.3 to 27.6mm 1 4 to 1 1 8 . Decorative hardwood plywood is available in thicknesses from 3, 2 to over 50.8mm 1 8 to over 2 . The standard size of a plywood sheet is 1.2 x 2.4m 4 x 8 , but other sizes and thicknesses can be manufactured on special order. Typical plywoods are manufactured in 3 to 5 layers, but with 3 to 6 plies. Although weights will vary with the species of wood used, 7.9mm 5 16 thick unsanded panels weigh approximately 4.88 kg m² 1.0 pound per square foot 19.0mm 3 4 panels weigh 10.7 kg m² 2.2 pounds per square foot , and 25.4mm 1 thick panels weight 14.6 kg m² 3.0 pounds per square foot . Hardwood plywood is generally a decorative wall paneling product, but is also used structurally, for example, in the structural integrity of mobile and manufactured homes. Because of plywood s cross laminate structure, it can support highly concentrated loads, even at unsupported edges. Shear strength varies with the kind of glue used, even though the glue line is very thin some tens of µm a few mils thick dry . Several types of water dispersable glues are used in plywood bonding, which vary in their resistance to moisture and are one of the bases used for grading as exterior or interior grade. Most glues used are thermosetting, and these vary in the temperature, temperature time, and temperature time pressure required to cure , as well as pot life , open time , viscosity, spreadability and other parameters essential for a suitable bonding agent. Softwood plywoods generally use phenolic adhesives phenol formaldehyde decorative hardwood plywoods generally use urea formaldehyde resins. The phenolic glues, which are highly water resistant, will cure in 4 to 5 minutes at temperatures as low as 149 C 300 F , but they have a short shelf life. The urea formaldehyde adhesives can be catalyzed with ammonium sulphate at 0.5 to 1.0 to bring about a lower temperature cure, and typically require from 10.5 to 21.1 bar 150 to 300 psi pressure depending on the density of the wood species being bonded at 110 to 127 C 230 to 260 F for 3 to 5 minutes. Resorcinol and phenol resorcinol resins are highly waterproof, and if properly catalyzed do not require heating for curing that is, they bond at room temperatures. Paraformaldehyde is a commonly used catalyst in bringing about the cross linking reaction. However, in comparison to the phenolics and ureas, they are very expensive, and hence are not used in plywood or panelling lamination, but are used in laminating heavy timbers and beams Glulam . Other widely used laminating adhesives are based on melamines melamine formaldehyde or melamine urea , but these are used mainly used mainly in furniture decorative laminates. Most of the glues used are flammable, although some are self extinguishing . They impart little fire resistance to the plywood. The fire hazard associated with the flammability of wood products is the principal limiting factor in the use of laminated woods as a material of construction. Almost all local, state and regional governing bodies have enacted building Codes which regulate the use of wood products in construction, and which dictate other norms for the prevention, early detection, and extinguishment of fires. Most advanced countries also have national building codes . Some fire preventive methods are structural , i.e., isolation of the wood members behind fire barriers others are spatial separating wood members by fire breaks and still others require the use of sprinkler or water deluge system installations. Chemical methods are also available, although not as widely used. These fall into two major categories a Impregnation with fire retardants or b Coating with paints which retard the spread of flame. Both are effective for short periods of time in reducing flame spread, but neither is significantly effective in increasing the resistance of wood to degradation under sustained fire exposure, or in preventing reduction of its load bearing capacity. The National Fire Protection Association NFPA has established a Standard 703 1979 for both Fire Retardant Impregnated Wood and Fire Retardant Coatings for Building Materials. The American Wood Preservers Association has a Standard AWPA C 27 with a requirement for a flamespread of 25 or less, with no evidence of significant progressive combustion when tested for 30 minutes duration under the ASTM E 84 Test Method. Fire Retardant Treatment of Lumber and Plywood is also covered by Federal Specification MIL L 19140 D Navy . U.S. Federal Specification SS A 118 b covers the use of flame retardant coatings on unfinished interior plywood and other construction products. Impregnation with fire retardant chemicals is an expensive procedure and a complicated process, since, in order to be effective, the chemicals must be applied under pressure in a closed pressure cylinder which requires that a vacuum be pulled first on the load to extract the air from the wood cells prior to pressurization. Chemicals commonly used in this impregnation are water soluble sulphate, borax, boric acid, zinc chloride, sodium dichromate and combinations thereof. Some of the salts are corrosive to metal fasteners and hardware nails, screws, bolts, hinges, etc. some prevent surface painting some species of wood must be scored to ensure penetration of the treating solution and being water soluble, the salts tend to leach out if exposed to weather. American Plywood Association APA mandates that allowable stresses be reduced 1 6th, and the modules of elasticity be reduced 1 10th for fire retardant chemical pressure impregnated plywood below normal design standards for untreated plywood. In addition, the fire retardant treatment of wood does not prevent the wood from decomposing and charring under fire exposure. The rate of fire penetration through treated wood is approximately the same as for untreated wood. Fire retardant coatings are also used to reduce the surface flammability of wood and laminated wood products. Prior art disclosed four major types of fire protective paints I Ablative 2 intumescent 3 sublimating and gas or vapor producing and 4 ceramic or inorganic. Ablative coatings are generally thick and heavy and costly, thus limiting, their application to special uses. Intumescent coatings are generally soft and easily abraded, and have limited duration of protection 10 to 15 minutes when exposed to fire before the delicate char cracks and is eroded away, leaving the substrate unprotected. They cannot be used internally submerged between the wood plies since their mode of action is inhibited by the glue line bond strength. The adhesive prevents their normal 10 times or greater expansion. Sublimative or gas producing coatings have even shorter duration of protection after their snuffing gases have been produced and wafted away, they are left without a protective mechanism. They have found their major use in the treatment of fibers and clothing where only short term exposure to flame is a major requirement. Ceramic coatings, as the name implies, require high temperature curing in order to form the ceramic bond, which many structural and building wood components cannot withstand. Inorganic coatings, such as Portland Cement, gypsum, calcium aluminate cement, phosphate bonded cements, silicate coatings, high temperature silicones, and magnesium oxychloride and magnesium oxysulphate cement coatings have all been proposed. The earlier application WO 85 04860 discloses seven type formulations for inorganic coatings, consisting of synergistic combinations of two and three non combustible inorganic bonding systems which efficiently prevent flame spread on the surface of susceptible substrates, and at the same time prevent flame from penetrating through the substrate. The American Society for Testing Materials ASTM has issued a series of Standard Test Methods for evaluating the protective abilities of fire retardant coatings and constructions E 119, Fire Tests of Building Construction and Materials D 3806, Small Scale Evaluation of Fire Retardant Paints 0.6 mm 2 Foot Tunnel Method E 286 Surface Flammability of Building Materials Using and 2.4m 8 Foot Tunnel Furnace . E 84, a 7.6m 25 foot Tunnel test the most widely accepted test , has its counterpart in Underwriters Laboratories UL 723 and the National Fire Protection Association NFPA 25 test methods. The tests determine the protection a coating affords its substrate and the comparative burning characteristics of coatings by evaluating flame spread over the surface when ignited under controlled laboratory conditions. The different tests are not comparable, although the results are correlatable. None of them describe or apprise the fire hazard of assemblies under actual fire conditions, but the results are usable as an element in fire risk assessment. The tests also give the basis for classifying the performance of the coatings based on their Flame Spread Index Values into Class A or I , Class B or II and Class C or III , used by most Building Codes. Index value classification depends on flame spread of the candidate fire retardant coated products or materials of construction, in comparison to known standards. Asbestos cement board is arbitrarily rated at 0 flame spread Red Oak lumber is rated at 100. Materials with the lowest rate of flame spread 0 25 are classified as Class I, and are permitted in areas where fire hazard is most severe such as exitways or unsprinklered buildings materials with rates from 26 to 75 are Class II, and are permitted in areas of intermediate severity materials rated 76 to 200 such as PS 1 uncoated construction plywood are Class III, and are permitted in most rooms when suitably protected by other design factors. Hospitals, institutions and buildings of public gatherings require Class I products or fire protective barriers. There is also a Class D or IV , with Index Values of from 201 to 500, and a Class E or V , with Index Values of over 500. Most untreated softwood plywoods and decorative hardwood plywoods fall into Class III, but this varies, depending on wood species, thickness, and glue type. These types of plywood constitute by far the great majority of laminated wood boards. Therefore, they are accepted for interior finish only, and not for exitways. If they could be upgraded to Class I economically, the range of their potential application would be extended considerably. The market for these products would also be considerably enlarged by the resulting savings in associated construction costs. In evaluating fire safety of laminated wood structures, two types of fire propagation must be considered Flame spread and fire resistance. Flame spread a measurement of the maximum extension of the flame on a sample is a property of the surface material once fire has started, not of the structure. Under test conditions, it is a ratio, not inches, versus the arbitrary standards . Flame spread is an indication of how fast fire can extend over a room s surface, but says little about the third dimension of fire spread, i.e. the depth of fire penetration through the substrate. Most of the fire retardant coatings influence only the flame spread rate, that is, they function to lower the lateral extension of the flaming surface per unit of time, but have little influence on the Burn Through Rate , since the coatings are a surface application. One exception to this statement is the disclosure in WO 85 04 860 referred to above. in which the surface coating prevents the ignition of the substrate so that a carbonized insulative char forms under the coating pyrolysis without flame and in an area restricted to the immediate zone of the initial fire. Fire Endurance or Resistance is The resistance against fire penetrating a wall, floor or roof, either directly or through a high rate of heat transfer that might cause combustible materials to be ignited on the cold side of the wall away from the actual fire. In short, it indicates the ability to resist burn through and measures the containment of the fire within a room or building. The standard test for measuring fire resistance is ASTM E 119 and resistance rating is expressed in the hours or the minutes that the construction withstands the test. The prime objective of this invention is to impart to the various types of laminated wood products generally termed plywoods , which term includes panelling, doorskin, and other structures composed of multi layered veneers, sufficient fire retardancy so that by themselves, without the need of other structural barriers, they form a fire barrier to both surface flame spread and burn through fire endurance , in short, develop a fire barrier plywood which meets the requirements for a Class I or A fire retardancy classification, and thus permit the use of these materials in those situations now barred to their use by fire hazards or construction code restraints. By obviating the necessity of using supplemental fire barriers, such as claddings, gypsum wallboard, and other structual alternatives, the use of fire barrier plywoods could lower construction costs, simplify design, decrease weight, add usable space to a structure, and lower insurance rates. Another objective is to overcome the deficiencies of the currently used alternative systems for imparting fire retardancy to plywoods viz. pressure impregnating the entire mass of the wood with fire retardant salts and resins, or surface coating alone with fire retardant paints and mastics. The use of pressure impregnated salts is costly, more than doubling the price of untreated plywood reduces the allowable stress limits by 16 and modulus of elasticity by 10 may be corrosive to metals, and is water leachable, thus restricting their outdoor use. Surface coatings are effective for only limited periods of time when exposed to fire are usually soft and easily abradable are usually applied on site after the installation, hence only cover the exposed, easily reached areas and are effective mainly against surface flame spread for limited periods of time. Their efficiency in preventing burn through is highly variable, and of relatively short duration. Still another objective is to develop a fire barrier coating which is relatively inexpensive, simple to apply, and which requires little modification of the procedures or equipment presently used in the manufacture of plywood. Another objective is to develop a fire barrier coating which in itself has sufficient adhesion to the various woods used in plywood construction to substitute for the currently used bonding glues, and or be compatible with those glues, so that they may be applied together utilizing existing equipment. In WO 85 04860 a series of tests is described Table II, p. 1 p. 3 and p. 1 a non combustible inorganic coating was applied between two pieces of 3 ply laminated plywood, and between two and four plies of doorskin, using the coating as the bonding agent adhesive for the layups. Results were unexpected, and highly successful. Surface flame spread, even on uncoated surfaces, was limited to little more than the contact area of the flame source, when exposed to a direct 1065 C 1950 F propane torch flame, or subjected to the Standard ASTM D 3806, 0.6m 2 foot Tunnel test burn through was prevented, and the flame did not extend to a depth greater than the level of the nearest layer of internal submerged coating. In addition to markedly increasing the fire resistance of the panels, the submerged coating layer was found to influence and limit the surface flame spread. The closer the submerged layer was to the surface, the smaller the extent of flame spread. The coating served as an excellent adhesive between the wood plies, and the bond did not delaminate under the heat from either the propane torch or the gas flame approximately 1037 to 1121 C 1900 to 2050 . Additionally, the coating can be tinted to match the color of the wood plies, so that the glue line is not apparent. This invention extends the disclosure of WO 85 04860 and broadens its applicability. The results from a specific type coating formulation have been expanded into a general model for a fire barrier system for plywood and other laminated wood products, applicable to most types of non combustible coatings. The general description of the invention is applicable to all types of plywoods and panelling. The Barrier Coating specific embodiments of a non flammable, inorganic, high temperature resistant coating, which can be applied to the wood plies by any method known to the art, viz. by brushing, spraying, rolling, roller coating, are described in WO 85 04860. This disclosure contemplates that any formulation which meets these criteria could be used to form the fire barrier layer. The subject matter of the invention is a fire resistant laminate for retarding flame spread and flame penetration therethrough, said laminate comprising A a solid, combustible lamina and B bonded to said lamina A , a hard, thin, continuous layer comprising an inorganic cementitious composition wherein said cementitious composition is coated on quartz fabric and wherein said layer B is capable of maintaining its structural strength and dimensional stability with zero flame spread when exposed to a flame temperature of 1093 C 2000 F for a time period of 1 hour and wherein said inorganic cementitious composition in a fluid state is capable of adhesively bonding to wood and maintaining an adhesive bond after drying to form said thin layer and wherein said inorganic cementitious composition consists essentially of wherein each of said cements is caused to set at a temperature up to about 490 C 120 F within about 45 minutes by said activator said laminate having a Class I or A fire retardancy classification. The floating layer B can be applied between one or several, or all of the plies, while the laminate is being laid up, prior to pressing and heat curing. It can also be applied to, or can be used to bond, two traditionally bonded multiple ply layups. In addition, the coating can be applied to the front or top surface, and or to the rear or lower surface of the laminate. At any of these levels top, intermediate, or bottom the coating influences and or prevents flame spread and fire penetration. The coating can be used alone as the adhesive or bonding agent, since it bonds tenaciously to the wood fibers. The length of time required for cure is a function of the specific coating formulation and the temperature. In the exemplary formulation discussed herein a synergistic combination of two or three bonding systems, viz magnesium oxide magnesium chloride, high alumina calcium aluminate cement, and a colloidal silica optional , the coating normally requires two hours to set at ambient temperature, but can be accelerated to 45 minutes at 49 C 120 F . The coating, consisting of both hydraulically setting and chemical setting systems, can cure anaerobically without access to air, and hence can cure when layered between the plies of the laminate. The coatings are easily sawed, nailed, or screwed. The thickness of the coating layer B can be varied at will from some tens of µm a few mils to 1.6mm 1 6 thick. The thicker the coating, the better the fire barrier performance. The greater the number of plies to be coated, the thinner each glue line needs to be. The fluid coating cementitious composition is coated on quartz fabric. When using impregnated fabric, the glue line is thicker on the order of 0.8mm 1 32 to 1.6mm 1 16 since the fabric holds more coating material. The fabrics add significantly to the flexural strength of the laminate. The coating saturated fabric cures at the same rate as the coating alone. Where a specific non combustible coating does not have the required bonding strength to a wood species veneer ply , and if it is desirable to use conventional bonding adhesives, the coating may still be used as the fire barrier layer. The impregnated fabric referred to above, is air cured into a flat rigid sheet and trimmed to proper size. It may have a smooth surface by curing between release paper, or left with a matte finish by being cured uncovered. All of the commonly used plywood adhesives phenol formaldehyde, urea formaldehyde, melamines, resorcinol, and phenol resorcinol show excellent adhesion to the type coatings discussed herein, and would probably show similar adhesion to other cementitious coatings. The cured coating and carrier fabric is laid up between the wood plies, using an adhesive layer on both surfaces, and conventionally bonded by pressure and the heating cycle required of the adhesive. Finally, the bond or glue line between the wood plies may be a mixture of conventional plywood adhesives and the non combustible coating. All of the wood adhesives referred to above are compatible with the type aqueous based non combustible coating which is described herein. To 80 85 by weight of the freshly prepared coating is added, with adequate mixing, 15 to 20 by weight of the selected adhesive, and the mix spread or applied to the wood plies in the conventional manner. The hybrid system requires a different time temperature cure cycle for each of its major components. If the phenolic or urea adhesives are cured under their typical press cycles prior to the cure of the coating, the fluid of the coating boils off and all cementitious properties as well as fire barrier properties are lost. Hence, the coating is permitted to cure first, although the cure may be accelerated by slight heating to 43 to 49 C 110 120 F or by adding known accelerators for both the MgO MgCl₂ and calcium aluminate systems . After the coating cures 1 to 2 hours as stated above, curing can take place anaerobically without exposure to air under the laid up plies of the laminate, the remainder of the hybrid system is subjected to the time temperature pressure curve of the adhesive component. As noted above, the resorcinol adhesives do not require a heating cycle, so if they are used, the normal pressure lamination process serves for both the adhesive and the coating components. This hybrid bonding system adds water repellency and enhanced adhesion to the coating without detracting from the latter s fire barrier properties. The function of the coating, whether applied to the surface of the plywood panel, or applied as a submerged layer between one or several or all of the plies, is to present an unbroken non combustible barrier to the flame front, and thus prevent the ignition of the substrate to which it is applied. The coating is not primarily an insulation, since, with time, conductive heat transfer will bring the substrate temperature near to that of the heat source, if the heat source remains constant and does not die out due to lack of fresh fuel in the immediate area of the initial flame. Those coatings which contain molecularly bound water of hydration serve as an insulation maintaining the substrate at a temperature no higher than 300 C 570 F , until all of the water has been driven off a period of time which depends upon the thickness of the coating. The energy required for this release is approximately 1.06 kj 1000 BTU s per 0.454 kg 1 pound of water released. The coatings may contain from 40 to 54 by weight of this bound water. Until spontaneous auto ignition temperature of the wood is reached approximately 343 C 650 F for 1 hour , in the absence of an igniting flame touching the surface, the substrate will pyrolyze and char, but will not ignite and will not support surface flame nor burn through. The char itself acts as an insulation, and resists temperature changes to the underlying wood which is important for strength retention. In Douglas Fir, the char base equilibrates at 288 C 550 F , well below the auto ignition temperature of the wood. 6.3mm 1 4 inward from the char, the maximum temperature reached is 182 C 360 F and at 12.7mm 11 2 inward, the maximum temperature is 93 C 200 F . This illustrates the importance of maintaining a cohesive coating which prevents flame from igniting the substrate. Many types of non combustible mostly inorganic coatings based mixtures of hydraulic and chemical setting cements are capable of performing this function, and meeting the other performance parameters required for a satisfactory coating. These are well known in the art, and many variations and combinations are possible. Among the types of coatings may be mentioned those based on Portland Cement, high alumina calcium aluminate cement, magnesium oxychloride and magnesium oxysulphate calcium sulphate Plaster of Paris , magnesium phosphates, alumina, silicas and silicates, such as colloidal silicas and sodium, potassium, ammonium, and organic silicates, refractory compositions, and a wide variety of phosphate bonded cementi tious compounds. In WO 85 04860 the following composition is disclose, Type II , as being one type of coating satisfactory for both surface application and submerged application, i.e., used either on the top or bottom of the plywood, and between the plies of wood laminates, when applied either alone or as an impregnated fabric. The materials specifications and behavior for each ingredient are discussed in detail. Also six other formulations are disclosed, all of which would also be satisfactory in this laminated plywood application. These coatings are the result of a synergistic reaction between two disparate binding systems, in which the stoichiometric imbalance between the magnesium oxide and magnesium chloride, caused by the need for sufficient fluidity in the mix to enable this subsystem to be applied as a paint or coating is compensated for by the high alumina calcium aluminate cement utilizing this excess liquid as its water of hydration. The excess magnesium chloride solution, if not otherwise utilized, would normally lead to a film disruption cracking and crazing , salt efflorescence, and a weak, soft coating. In these formulations, the The yield from this batch size is 700 cm³. In the F0RMULATI0N NO. II, presented above, Part A is added to Part B with adequate mixing to the consistency of a house paint, and applied by brushing, spraying, roller coating, or flooding to yield the desired dried thickness. The fluid paint has a specific gravity of 1.71, and weighs 1.71 kg dm² 14.26 pounds per gallon . The coating develops an initial set in 1 hour, and a final set in 2 to 2 1 2 hours, and maximum strength in 24 hours. It dries crack free. It is brilliant white, with high infrared radiation reflectivity. Since the dominant mode of heat transfer of a fire is by radiation, the difference between a white reflective surface emittance of approximately 0.8 and a dull absorptive surface emittance 0.3 results in a lowering of the surface temperature of several hundred degrees at the 1037 to 1093 C 1900 2000 F range in the former. Where the surface of the plywood is coated with this white paint, this surface directly faces the fire. Where the coatings are submerged and placed between the plies, as the top ply is burned off, it exposes the bright white coating underneath. Usually two coats are applied to the surface, although one is adequate if an internal or submerged coating is also applied. The coating has a relatively low heat conductivity, and thus acts as a thermal insulator for a short period of time. There is little lateral spread of heat when exposed to the direct impingement of 1065 C 1950 F propane flame source of 25.4 mm 1 diameter. The zone of influence, or halo or penumbra , of 260 to 280 C 500 to 550 F extends, after 15 minute exposure, only an additional 25.4 to 38.1 mm 1 to 1 1 2 in diameter, beyond which the temperature does not exceed 82 to 93 C 180 to 200 F . The coating used alone or impregnated into one of the fabrics listed previously, when cured, forms a hard highly abrasion resistant ceramic like layer Mohs hardness of 5.5 . It conforms with exquisite detail to the surface of the wood substrate, and bonds tenaciously. The surface coating can also be tinted any desired color, or overprinted with a pattern or top covered with wall paper on the surface. The coating may be cured smooth and glistening glabrous or with a matte finish. Coating impregnated woven fabrics have a pleasant decorative appearance. Surface coatings may be field applied , i.e. after panel installation, and handled as a special paint application, or factory applied coatings can be touched up after installation to repair any damage. When exposed to flame, the coating retains its integrity during the heat up and exposure periods. Occasionally, depending on the speed of cool down, it will show one or two stress relieving cracks. After 15 to 20 minutes exposure to the direct flame at a temperature of approximately 1093 to 1204 C 2000 to 2200 F the coating will show sign of calcination, but it still retains its integrity. The softer calcined areas can be scraped away, but they do not peel nor flake off on their own accord. When coated onto or impregnated into a woven or non woven fabric, under the 1065 C 1950 F propane torch for 30 to 60 minutes, the fabric does not combust, and there is zero flame spread from the area of the cone of impingement of the flame. The fabric serves both as a stroma, or supporting framework, and as a network of stress relief foci. The numerous minute fibrils interlock with the crystallites as they form, leaving compressible points at which the volumetric changes associated with the heat engendered phase changes in the cements have an opportunity to release their thermodynamic energies. They also serve to increase significantly the tensile strength and flexural modulus of the laminated plywood. A variety of types of laminated wood construction were fabricated using the inorganic high temperature resistant non combustible coating referred to above a the coating impregnated quartz fabric applied to the top or exposed surface of 3.2, 6.4, 12.7 and 15.9mm 1 8 , 1 4 , 1 2 and 5 8 thick standard interior exterior plywood and 3.2mm 1 8 doorskin b the coating impregnated quartz fabric applied to the bottom or unexposed surface of these same products c two, three, and four pieces of 6.4, 9.5 and 112.7mm 1 4 , 3 8 and 1 2 plywood, and 3.2mm 1 8 doorskin and 6.4 1 4 thick wall panelling were utilized as plies and bonded together with the coating impregnate fabric as defined above as the adhesive, and cured anaerobically at ambient temperatures in a press under slight pressure of 1.4 to 2.1 bar 20 to 30 psi . Each of the plies in these laminations actually consisted of a standard 3 , 4 or 5 ply plywood, or doorskin bonded together with a standard thermosetting organic resin adhesive d top surface coating applied to submerged coating bonded laminates and e bottom surface coating applied to submerged coating bonded laminates. This latter was intended to function as the final barrier to prevent ignition and burn through to any other substrate, e.g. roof sheathing subflooring, wall partitions, etc. . Two types of fire exposure tests were performed a The propane torch test The hottest part of the high velocity 1065 C 1950 F flame was directed against the candidate coated sample, usually 22.9 x 22.9cm 9 x 9 , or 30.5 x 30.5cm 12 x l2 in size, or its uncoated control. The samples were mounted free standing at a 15 inclination off the vertical, and held steady in a test bracket for the test duration, which extended for as long as 60 minutes. Readings were taken every minute of the temperatures on the back, signs of discoloration, amount of smoke generated, evidence of coating cracking, surface burning, burn through and temperature peripherally from the center of the flame contact and b ASTM D 3806 Small Scale Evaluation of Fire Retardant Paints 2 foot Tunnel method . These were certified tests run by Applied Research Laboratories ARL of Miami, Florida, on 60cm 2 foot long by 10.2cm 4 wide test panels. This test consists of impinging directly onto the surface coating a 1096 C 2000 F gas flame supplying heat, at 5.39 kj 5085 BTU s per hour, for 5 minutes, while the test panel is suspended above the burner, coated surface facing downward, at an upward angle, in a chamber. The angle of the test panel, and the draft of the chamber, encourages any flame in the coating and substrate initiated from the burner to proceed upward along the substrate. The extent of this flame front is measured and compared with the known substrate standards 0 and 100 . In addition to flame spread, the smoke density, fuel contributed, and weight loss are also recorded and calculated. Although this test is mainly concerned with flame spread along the surface, weight loss and visual inspection and depth measurement shows fire endurance resistance, or burn through protection . Flame spread is the main factor associated with testing fire retardant coatings. The fire retardant coatings currently available are rated as low as 10, or as high as 60 or 70. The lower the rating, the longer the coating will retard flame. With this invention it has been shown that under the test conditions a When high temperature inorganic non flammable coatings or coating impregnated fabrics are applied to the front or hot surface of a laminated wood product plywoods , they are capable of achieving zero 0 flame spread, as well as zero 0 smoke density, and zero 0 fuel contributed and of stopping, or considerably slowing down, fire penetration. This latter is a function of flame exposure time. In a 5 minute test there is little penetration. In a 15 or 20 minute test, there is substrate charring but no flaming b coatings applied to the rear, or cold surface of a laminated wood product, at a depth of 9.5 to 12.7mm 3 8 to 1 2 below the front surface, prevents flame from reaching the substrate on which it may be mounted, limits the burn through area to a circle of only a couple of inches in diameter and influences surface flame spread by restricting it to an area only slightly larger than the burn through circle c one or several internal or submerged coating layers between the wood plies, are highly effective in preventing fire penetration and burn through. The flame is usually stopped by the first coating layer continued flame exposure leaves a char behind that first coating layer. If not stopped by the first layer, flame penetration is stopped by the second coating layer. Even in exposures for as long as 60 minutes in the normally highly combustible doorskin laminates, made up of four layers of doorskin 3.2mm 1 8 thick, with 3 layers of coating alone between the plies, the flame did not penetrate to the rear surface. Moreover, the flame spread on the surface, as well as the hole which did penetrate to the second layer of coating, was restricted to 50.8 to 63.5mm 2 to 2 1 2 in diameter. As a general rule, when the surface is uncoated, the closer the first layer of internal or submerged coating is to the surface of the panel, the greater its effectiveness in decreasing surface flame spread d a surface coating backed up by one or two internal coats at 3.2 to 6.4mm 1 8 to 1 4 depth below the surface coat yielded substantially zero 0 surface flame spread, and a minimum of flame penetration. The coatings applied to the rear of the panels, almost always retained their integrity, remaining whole, and prevented flame from penetrating through to the space on the other side. In practice, this would prevent a chimney effect involving spaces between studs and if applied to roofing shingles, would prevent ignition of the roofing sheathing. In addition, this rear coating may obviate the necessity for utilizing gypsum wallboard as a rear fire barrier. An additional advantage of the coating systems is that by greatly reducing flame spread and penetration, they decidedly decrease smoke emission.
