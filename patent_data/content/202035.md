# Wear resistant, sintered iron alloy and process for producing the same.

## Abstract
Wear resistant, sintered iron alloys are provided. The alloys have a structure in which iron based hard particles having a relatively high Cr content and copper or copper alloy particles are dispersed in an iron alloy matrix contain ing a relatively low content of Cr. The alloys are prepared by compression molding powders of the matrix alloy, the hard alloy, copper or copper alloy, an Fe P alloy and graphite and sintering the obtained molding at a temperature of 980 to 1130 C.
