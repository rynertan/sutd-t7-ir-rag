# Chip capacitor having a compliant termination.

## Abstract
A monolithic capacitor chip 10 comprises a body formed of stacked, alternately arranged layers of dielectric material 16 and metallic electrode material 18 , alternate electrodes extend ing to opposite end faces of the body, and a noncompliant metalized layer 20 , 22 on each of the opposite end faces electrically contacting the electrodes 18 extending thereto. Each of the noncompliant metalized layers 20 , 22 is provided with a compliant coating 32, 34 of an alloy preferably comprising more than 90 lead. A metallic layer 36, 38 is disposed over the surface of each of the compliant coatings 32, 34 , the melting point of the metallic layers 36, 38 being greater than that of the compliant coating 32, 34 . The metallic layer 36, 38 preferably consists of a layer of copper or nickel plating, the surface of which is plated with an oxidation resistant metal such as tin, gold, or the like.
