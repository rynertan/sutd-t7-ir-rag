# Coal and wood burning stoves.

## Abstract
The invention provides a stove for burning a charge of fuel by primary air directed either above or underneath through the firebed. A firebed support is defined by an array of alternating fixed and movable bars 10, 12, the movable bars 12 having a length greater than their width when viewed endwise and being rotatable between a vertical attitude in which they permit upward passage of air and downward passage of ash through said support and a horizontal attitude in which they permit build up of a layer of ash at the base of the firebed. An air distribution chamber 26 has an inlet 30 for primary air, a first outlet 31 from which primary air passes to a space 28 above the firebed and a second outlet 32 from which primary air passes to a space below the firebed. An air diversion flap 33 is movable between positions in which air is selectively directed through the first and through the second outlet 31 or 32 . Control means 22, 37, 35 operatively connects to the movable bars 12 and to the air diversion flap 33 to maintain them in an interlocked relationship so that the stove may be altered between one state in which the movable bars 12 are directed generally horizontally and primary air passes through the first outlet 31 and a second state in which the movable bars 12 are directed generally vertically and primary air passes through the second outlet 32 . Furth ermore the stove has a housing having a generally upright front wall in which is formed an aperture for charging fuel and also for exposure of the firebed to permit enjoyment of its radiant heat and a firedoor 51 that in a lowered position closes off the aperture. The firedoor is supported at either side on arms pivoted to opposed sides of the housing and spring loaded to balance the weight of the door. A top canopy 61 has a front wall that defines with the upper region of the front wall 65 of the housing a slot into which the firedoor may be raised clear of the aperture and concealed.
