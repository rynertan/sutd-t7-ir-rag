# AUDIO VOLUME CONTROL FOR CATV AND METHOD THEREFOR

## Abstract
A volume control circuit useful for remotely controlling volume through a CATV remote control unit uses a sound carrier demodulator 13 to obtain an intercarrier sound signal 18 . The intercarrier sound signal 18 is further demodulated 16 to obtain a detected audio signal whose amplitude can then be easily controlled by an amplifier. The gain of the amplifier can then be controlled from the remote unit. The detected audio 21 is then remodulated 17 with the RF video carrier 15 . The remodulated audio is then summed 23 with the video signal to provide an RF output signal having amplit ude controlled audio.
