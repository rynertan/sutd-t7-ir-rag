## Abstract
A device for the indirect, non invasive and continuous measurement of blood pressure in a finger by using a photo electric plethysmograph having a pressure cuff 1 to be placed around the finger and to be filled with fluid, an associated light source 3 and light detector 4 , an electro nic circuit, and an electric control valve 10 having at least one fluid flapper nozzle system, the cuff pressure being controlled by the plethysmographic signal in closed loop operation such that the arterial volume is maintained on a pre adjusted value and each deviation thereof due to changes in intra arterial pressure is compensated immedi ately, whereby the control valve 10 consists of a double fluid flapper nozzle system in balance connection, whereby a single flapper member v is positioned between the oppo sitely arranged nozzle openings of two nozzle members T1, T2 and alternately opens and closes these nozzle openings, one flapper nozzle system being used in opposite sense, and one single chamber surrounding both nozzle openings being connected to the pressure cuff.
