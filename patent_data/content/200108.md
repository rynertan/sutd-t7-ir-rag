# TUNGSTEN LADEN EMISSION MIX OF IMPROVED STABILITY

## Abstract
High pressure sodium lamps have been subject to progressive reduction in pressure of contained sodium with attendant reduction in lighting quality. It has now been discovered that modification of lamp components permits the pressure of contained sodium to be maintained at higher levels. Emission materials enclosed within the lamp are altered to limit reactive oxygen in the lamp atmosphere. A thermionic electrode is equipped with an improved emission mix composition containing an oxide selected from the group consisting of tungsten, molybdenum and yttrium. The emission mix also contains the metal of the respective oxide in finely divided form.
