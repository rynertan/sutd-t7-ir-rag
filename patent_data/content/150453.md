# INTER LOGICAL AREA DATA TRANSFER CONTROL SYSTEM

## Abstract
An improved inter area data transfer control system is disclosed which includes a display control device provided with an area movement function and is capable of providing the logical transverse widths of source SW and destination DW areas registers 72 and 74 in a logical memory space separately from each other so as to reduce time required to execute the transfer of data from the source area to the destination area. The system comprises means 71 for specifying a transfer start point of a source area S means 73 for specifying a transfer start point of a destination area D means 61 for holding amounts of data to be transferred in a horizontal direction means 63 for holding amounts of data to be transferred in a vertical direction and, means 72, 74 for providing the logical transverse width of said source area S and the logical transverse width of said destination area D separately, characterized in that a plurality of data of said source area specified by said means are read out from said memory unit 4 and are sequentially written into said destination area D so as to achieve transfer of said data between said source and destination areas S, D .
