# IGNITION SYSTEM FOR AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE

## Abstract
An ignition system for an internal combustion engine having a plurality of engine cylinders, wherein ignition coil 10 and spark plug 13 are integrally assembled into each engine cylinder so as to eliminate an ignition energy trans mission loss, a DC DC converter 17 for boosting a low DC voltage into a high DC voltage is provided for applying the high DC voltage into each secondary winding Lâ‚‚ of the ignition coils for achieving an efficient ignition of air fuel mixture, the application of the high DC voltage being en abled according to a particular engine operating condition, e.g., engine low speed and light engine load condition, and the ignition energy being varied according to an engine operating condition by changing the pulsewidth of the ig nition pulse signal to be fed into a cylinder judging circuit 14 which judges the spark plug to be ignited and distributes the ignition pulse signal into the related circuit of the corres ponding ignition coil.
