# Core shell composite polymers having high amounts of carboxylic acid units in the shell.

## Abstract
Aqueous dispersions of soft polymers, and particularly butadiene styrene copolymers, containing high amounts of carboxylic acid units are prepared by a core shell polymer ization technique in which there is first polymerized around the soft polymer an inner shell layer of methylmethacrylate, thereby completely encasing the soft polymer particles. Then an outer layer of methlmethacrylate and methacrylic acid monomers is polymerized around the encased particles. The product contains up to about 40 mole percent of methacrylic acid units in the shell.
