# Heel binding for cross country skis.

## Abstract
A heel binding 10 for a cross country ski 12 has opposing latches 26, 27 movable toward each other under engagement by spaced apart flexible beams 60, 61 that force the latches together to capture a projection 20 from the heel of a skier s shoe to hold the heel to the ski. The inside surfaces 52, 53 of the latches are cam shaped to allow releasing force on the pin 20 to urge the latches outward against the flexible beams, and to release the pin when the force is substantial enough, as in a fall. A collar 30 slidable on the flexible beams adjusts the effective stiffness of the flexible beams to adjust the releasing force.
