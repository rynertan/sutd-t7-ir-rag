# Endoscopes having a focus state detector.

## Abstract
An endoscope provided with a focus state detector, wherein light is projected through a light guide 33 to be reflected from an object and received by a light receiving means 11 provided with an optical aperture 15 or locally non sensitive part of a small diameter or width to detect focusing. When an object to be recorded by a photo graphic or television camera is low in contrast, such as an internal organ observed with an observing optical system of an endoscope, the depth of focus may be so shallow that it will be difficult to obtain a clear image of the object by fitting and setting the lens system in a well focussed state. Therefore, embodiments of the present invention pro vide means for projecting a focus state detecting light spot of high intensity onto the object 25 through the light spot guide 33 from an external light source 32 , and the intensity of the reflected light from the object 25 adjusted to give a unique value from the light receiving means, which indicates the correct focus setting with high precision.

## Description
ENDOSCOPES HAVING AFOCUS STATE DETECTOR This invention relates to endoscopes having a focus state detector, means being provided for projecting a light beam of high intensity through a spot illuminating light guide. Recently endoscopes have become extensively used in both the therapeutic field and the industrial field. Particularly in the therapeutic field, it is a common practice for diagnostic purposes to directly observe an organ or the like within a body cavity by the eye, through an eyepiece of an endoscope, and to record an optical image for diagnosis by fitting a photographic or television camera. In the case of observation with the naked eye, a clear optical image can be formed, that is, as the state of focus will be apparent to the technician when he is adjusting the instrument, but if a photographic or television camera is fitted, to obtain a clear optical image it is necessary to ensure that the lens is correctly adjusted to a correct focus setting. The light reflected to form an optical image from an object such as an organ within a body cavity is generally so low in intensity and the contrast so poor that, in most cases of recording an image of an object only a short distance from the entry plane of the optical system, the depth of focus will become so shallow that it is very difficult to obtain a correct focus state. Therefore, the recorded image is often found to be out of focus, and a means by which the correctly focussed state can be positively detected in an endoscope has been long desired. One object of the present invention is to provide an endoscope having a focus state detector, using means projecting a spot of illuminating light of high intensity, to ensure that even if a dark optical system is used a focusing spot will be clearly detectable with high precision, using a simple structure of low cost contained in a small space. According to the present invention there is provided an endoscope having a focus state detector, means being provided to transmit illuminating light from a light source to a light beam transmitting means within an endoscope via a light guide and a light spot guide to project a light spot on to an object that is to be recorded as an optical image, the image of the illuminated object being passed back to a predetermined image forming surface via an observing optical system in the endoscope and thence through an adjustable lens system whose focusing state is monitored by said detector, which comprises a light receiving means using a photoelectric transducer element to assess whether there is a clearly focussed image at said image forming surface, the light returning from said projected light spot being directed to an optical aperture or locally non sensitive part of said transducer having a shape and size matching that of the reflected light spot formed in a position optically conjugate with said image forming surface. The invention will now be described with reference to the drawings, in which Figure 1 is an explanatory view showing an optical system of a focus state detector within an endoscope in a first exemplary embodiment, where the detector is contained in a camera adaptor Figure 2 is a plan view showing the shape of a photoelectric element used in the embodiment shown in Figure 1 Figure 3 is a schematic explanatory view showing the focus detector mode of operation, with the optical system of the embodiment shown in Figure 1 converted to a linear optical system for the sake of simplicity Figure 4 is a graph showing the changes in output characteristics of a photoelectric element as the position of an object to be photographed via the optical system shown in Figure 3 is varied Figure 5 is a block schematic diagram showing the circuit arrangement provided in the embodiment shown in Figure 1 for focus state detection, and for setting an objective lens in a correctly focussed position if an automatic control of focus and exposure is provided Figure 6 is an explanatory view showing an optical system of a second exemplary embodiment of an endoscope with a focus state detector Figure 7 is a schematic explanatory view showing the focus state detecting principle with the optical system of the embodiment shown in Figure 6 converted to a linear optical system for the sake of simplicity Figure 8 is an explanatory graph showing the variation of output characteristics of a photoelectric transducer element as the position of the object to be recorded is varied in the optical system shown in Figure 7 Figure 9 is an explanatory view showing the optical system of a third exemplary embodiment of the present invention Figure 10 is an explanatory view showing the optical system of a fourth exemplary embodiment of the present invention, Figure 11 is an explanatory detail showing a part of a light projecting means in a fifth exemplary embodiment of the present invention Figure 12 is an explanatory view showing the optical system of a sixth exemplary embodiment of the present invention and Figure 13 is a plan view of one alternative form of photo electric transducer element suitable for use in the described embodiments. In the embodiment shown in Figure 1, a camera adaptor 5 for a photographic camera is removably fitted to the rear end side of an eyepiece 3 of an endoscope 4 formed with an elongate insertion sheath 1 housing an objective optical system and illuminating optical system extending to the front tip, and leading to the eyepiece 3 at the outer end of the insertion sheath 1, where a light guide mouthpiece 2 is provided on the side. A photographic or television camera 6 is attached via an adaptor 5 to be removably fitted to the rear. An endoscope focus setting device whereby the objective lens of the optical system can be automatically moved and set at a correctly focussed position by using the output of the endoscope focus state detector of the present invention is contained in the camera adaptor 5. An objective lens 8 movable forward and rearward on an optical axis 7, as indicated by arrows, is arranged facing the eyepiece lens system of the endoscope 4 on the optical axis when the endoscope 4 is fitted in place. A semi transparent focusing mirror 9 inclined for example, by 45 degrees to the optical axis 7, is arranged on the optical axis 7 to the rear of the lens 8. An image re forming lens 10 and a photo electric transducer element 11 are arranged as a light receiving means on a reflected optical axis to the upper position as drawn in Figure 1 on which the light incident along the above mentioned optical axis 7 is reflected by the focusing mirror 9. A lamp lens 13 and focus indicating lamp 14 indicating focusing are arranged in turn on the reflected optical axis in the lower position as drawn in Figure 1 to the rear side of the focusing mirror 9. The photo electric transducer element 11 is in the form of a plate, which may be a disc, or a square or rectangular element, and has provided an aperture 15 of a small shape such as a pinhole or a rectangular slit at its centre, as shown in Figure 2.On the front face of this disc plate there is formed a photo electric surface 17 of a photo sensitive material, for example, a photo diode, photo transistor or a photocell e.g. of CdS , or an element producing a photoelectric motive force, such as a solar battery. On the rear side of the plate there is formed a light intercepting surface 18. A return mirror 21 inclined for example, by 45 degrees with the optical axis 7 is arranged on the optical axis 7 to the rear of the focusing mirror 9, in the camera 6 fitted to the rear of the camera adaptor 5. A photographic film 22 is arranged further to the rear on the optical axis. A pentaprism 23 turning the image laterally back to an erect image is arranged on the reflected optical axis Cto the upper side as drawn in the illustration of the return mirror 21t and a viewfinder lens 24 is arranged on the optical axis through this pentaprism 23, so that the optical image as formed on the film 22 can be observed by eye close to the rear of the view finder lens 24. In the case of photography, the return mirror 21 will be retracted so that the incident light can form an image on the surface of the film 22, when an exposure is made. The position of the photo electric surface 17 of the transducer element 11 is arranged to be optically conjugate with the position of the surface of the film 22. That is to say, the light path for light passing through the lens 8 to form an image on the surface of the film 22 and the light path for light reflected by the focusing mirror 9 to form an image on the photo electric surface 17 of the transducer element 11 through the image re forming lens 10 are mutually equal. A light guide provided as an illuminating light transmitting means through the insertion sheath 1 of the endoscope 4 is connected with a light guide supply optical fibre bunch 31 in the light guide mouthpiece 2.Illuminating light from a diagnosis light source 32 is projected onto the input end face of this light guide 31. In this embodiment, it is a feature that the above mentioned light guide 31 has a branched portion, so that light is not only transmitted to the mouthpiece 2 of the endoscope 4 but also to the pinhole 15 in the light intercepting surface 18 on the adjacent side of the transducer element 11 to form a light spot guide 33 to project illuminating light for focus state detection toward an object 25 that is to be recorded, using the pinhole 15 as an aperture for projecting light from the emitting end face of this light spot guide 33. The principle of the focus state detecting function in the camera adaptor 5 of this first exemplary embodiment will now be explained with reference to Figure 3, in which the optical system is simplified, to be shown as a linear optical system. As shown in Figure 3, the light projected onto the input end face of the light spot guide 33 from the light source 32 will be emitted from the other end to be projected and reflected by the object 25 that is to be recorded, and will return to the photo sensitive side of the transducer element 11 via the lens 8 and mirror 9. If the object 25 to be recorded is in the position indicated by the reference symbol b, a correctly focussed image will be formed, but if the object 25 is too near or too far, then it will be out of focus on return, as indicated by broken lines or chain dotted lines respectively related to the positions a and c. The reference symbols a and c correspond respectively to the front focus and rear focus with respect to the objective lens 8 . In the above mentioned case, the light projected through the pinhole 15 will form a projected light image that is matched to the pinhole shape, and when the object 25 is in the position b, the light reflected will be convergent to form an image point in the pinhole 15 and therefore no light from the light spot guide will fall upon the photo sensitive surface 17 around the pinhole 15. On the other hand, if the object 25 is in the position a the reflected beam is expanded and light reflected will be directed to come to a point to the rear of the pinhole 15, and will therefore strike the photo electric surface 17 on the outer periphery of the pinhole 15, and produce an output signal.In the like manner, light projected onto an object 25 in the position c will be reflected to form a convergent point in the front of the pinhole 15, and will then expand to reach the photo electric surface 17, and produce a signal from the photo electric transducer element. The above description relates to the light from the illuminating diagnosis light source 32 being emitted on paths close to the optical axis 7. In fact, the illuminating light will be projected toward the object 25 over a relatively wide angle, even by the light guide inserted through the endoscope 4. Therefore, the reflected light from a position displaced from the optical axis 7 will be partly incident and the output signal of the photo electric transducer element 11 may be swamped by the output level of this diagnosis light component as shown in Figure 4 wherein the abscissa represents the positions of the object that is to be photographed and the ordinate represents examples of the detecting output levels of the photoelectric transducer element 11. Thus, when the object 25 to be photographed is in the correct focus position b, the output level Pb of the photo electric transducer element 11 will be minimum, and if it is nearer or farther than that, the respective signal output levels Pa and Pc will be larger. Thus, the position in which the signal output is a minimum will indicate the correct focus position.Therefore, if a camera is used with the objective lens 8 in the position in which the output of the photo electric transducer element 11 is at a minimum, as determined by moving the lens 8 with respect to the object 25 at any distance, a clearly focussed image photograph can be recorded. If the lens 8 is moved, the direction in which the output level becomes smaller will be recognised as that which approaches the correct focusing state, and therefore the lens 8 can be manually or automatically moved in this direction.In the case of automatic setting of the focus, if the movement is stopped at a point where the output level begins to increases and centred at the point where there is substantially no change with movement of the lens 8, the photographic lens 8 can be set in the correct focus position for an object 25 at any distance. The above described principle can be applied in exactly the same way to an optical system within the camera 6 shown in Figure 1, except that the image reforming lens 10 and focusing mirror 9 must then be arranged on a path to the photo electric transducer element 11 to the rear of the camera objective lens and the endoscope 4 is arranged on the path to the object 25 in front of the camera objective lens. In the camera adaptor 5 shown in Figure 1, when correct focusing is achieved, a focus state indicating lamp 14 will light and light from this lamp will be condensed by a lamp lens 13, reflected by the return mirror 9, to proceed rearwardly on the optical axis 7 and be incident upon the eye of an observer through the return mirror 21, pentaprism 23 and view finder 24. Therefore, if an exposure is made when the focus state indicating lamp 14 lights, a clear image will be recorded. The illuminating light for the light spot in the above described embodiment is fed through the lightspot guide 33 from the external illuminating diagnosis light source 32. Therefore, an illuminating beam of a sufficient intensity can be projected toward the object 25 to be recorded without being limited by the space available within the camera adaptor 5 or the like. Therefore, the detecting output level of the photo electric transducer element 11 will be better than an arrangement requiring the light source to be within the adaptor, and the detecting sensitivity and signal to noise ratio SN ratio will also be improved relative to the latter arrangement. Figure 5 shows a block schematic diagram of the circuit arrangement for an endoscope focus setting device 41 whereby the lens 8 is automatically moved and set at the correct focus point by using the first described focus state detector, together with an automatic exposure device. The focus setting device 41 comprises a light source power supply 43 which energises the light source 32 to emit light to be projected onto the object 25 that is to be photographed or otherwise recorded. A focus state detector circuit 44 amplifies any signal output produced by light that is reflected from the object 25 by the photo electric transducer element 11 provided with an aperture such as the pinhole 15, and detects whether focus is correct or not. An indicator 45 corresponding to the above mentioned focus indicating lamp 14 indicates the instant when focusing is correct, after an objective lens driving device 46 has caused the lens 8 to move to the required focus position. The above mentioned light emitting circuit 43 is so formed that, for example, when a release button 47 is pushed, a normally open switch SW1 will be closed, whilst a normally closed switch SWZ remains on to feed electrical power from a current source 48 indicated by a battery to energise the light source 32, and illuminating light for focus state detection will be emitted through the pinhole 15 from the back of the photo electric transducer element 11 via the light spot guide 33 from this light source 32. The focus state detector circuit 44 comprises an amplifier 49 amplifying the output signal of the photo electric transducer element 11, and a comparator detecting circuit 5Q. This comparator detecting circuit 50 is so formed that if the driving device 46 moves the lens 8 forward or rearward at a fixed velocity, for example,, detecting signals amplified by the amplifier 49 will be fed in in sequence at given intervals, and in each case the previous signal value compared with the signal value now applied, until the later signal is equal to or larger than the previous signal, when a sensing signal is produced to stop the driving device 46 and move the lens 8 in the reverse directionr until the sensing signal is set constant for a given time, the signal being integrated and the integrated output is above a fixed value, or when the number of sensing signals fed in within a fixed time is counted and the counted number found to be above a given value, the indicator 45 will be lighted and the operation of the driving device 46 will be stopped. On the other hand, when the release button 47 is pushed further down, a third, normally open switchSW3 will be closed and the second switch SW2 opened so that the endoscope focus setting device 41 will not operate but the third switch SW3 will operate the automatic exposing EE device 51 now to be described. This EE device 51 comprises an amplifier 54 wherein, when the switch SW3 is closed and, electric power fed from a current source 52, and any detecting signal from a photo sensitive photo electric transducer element 53 will be amplified and fed to an EE control circuit 57 which controls respectively the shutter speed of an EE shutter 55 and a light intensity control circuit 56 controlling the light output of the light source 32, so that when the switch SW3 is closed the EE control circuit 57 will operate to adjust the shutter speed and light output. In the focus setting device 41 formed as described above, the lens 8 is moved and set in the correct focus position by an operation now to be described. When the release button 47 is pushed to close the switch SW1, the light source 32 will be energised and this light will be transmitted through the light spot guide 33, pass through the pinhole 15, be reflected by the focusing mirror 9, passed through the lens 8 and endoscope 4 and projected as a spot onto the object 25. The light reflected by the object 25 will pass back through the lens 8, to be reflected by the focusing mirror 9 and proceed to the photo electric transducer element 11 provided with the pinhole 15. If the above mentioned lens 8 is in the correct focus position for the object 25 to be clearly photographed, or recorded the output level of the photo electric transducer element 11 will be at a minimum value. Therefore, in this case, when the driving device 46 moves the lens 8, forward for example, the output level will become larger, and therefore the advancing operation will be immediately stopped, a sensing signal will be put out to the comparator detecting circuit 50, and the driving device 46 will move the lens 8 in the reverse direction.Again, the output level will become larger, and therefore the sensing signal will be emitted, the operation of moving the lens 8 rearward will be stopped, the lens 8 will be moved in the reverse direction that is, forward and will thus slightly vibrate on the optical axis 7. In this case, the sensing signal will be repeatedly emitted by the comparator detecting circuit 50, and therefore, if it is fed to an integrating circuit having a proper time constant, or to a counting circuit, the output will .rise above a given value and the vibrating action will be stopped. On the other hand, if the objective lens 8 is away from the correct focusing position initially, if the driving device 46 moves the photographic lens 8 in the direction taking it further from the focusing position, the output level of the photo electric element 11 will gradually increase and therefore the comparator detecting circuit 50 will control the driving device 46 to move the lens 8 in the reverse direction, as is described above. When the lens 8 passes through the correct focus position, the slight vibrating operation, as described above, will be initiated and the lens 8 will finally be set in the correct focus position. When the lens 8 is thus correctly set the indicator 45 will cause the focusing indicating lamp 14 to light. When the observer sees this, by further pushing the release button 47, the EE device 51 can be caused to operate and a photograph or recording will be made. The EE device 51 is operated simultaneously in this embodiment, when the button 47 operates the switch contact SW3, but in some cases it may be advantageous to have the EE device continuously operating.The indicator 45 may be made to operate a buzzer or like transducer instead of lighting the lamp 14. In this first embodiment, as part of the light guide 31 transmitting the illuminating light from the light source 32 is utilised for the light spot focusing light, an adequately intense focusing illumination can be projected onto the object 25 without increasing the volume and weight of the adaptor device, whilst the output level of the photo electric transducer element 11 and the SN ratio will be better than that obtained if a separate light source of limited size is provided within the adaptor, and the focus state can be detected without impairing the operating function, even in an endoscope of a dark optical system. The light spot guide 33 of the light projecting means extends out of the adaptor, but the focus detecting part with the photo electric transducer element 11 in which the pinhole 15 is formed can readily be contained within a small space. As the first embodiment has such a simple construction it can be realised at a low cost. As the light projecting means is provided, if the intensity of the light to be projected is adjusted, even in case a dark optical system is to be used, focusing will be able to be detected at a high precision. The focus setting device using the first embodiment sets the lens 8 so that the output level of the light receiving photo electric transducer element 11 may be of a minimum value and therefore, the lens 8 can be set in a correctly focussed state with high precision to obtain a clear recorded image without impairing the operating function. Figure 6 shows the optical system of a second exemplary embodiment of the present invention, in which modified means are provided for projecting and receiving the focus state detecting light. A beam splitter, formed by jointing two right prisms 61A and 61B for example, is arranged to the rear upper side in the illustration of an image reforming lens 10. Light intercepting plates 63A and 63B with respective pinholes 62A and 62B are bonded on adjacent surfaces of the right prism 61A and 61B so that the respective pinholes are to the rear of the optical axes passing through and reflected by the jointing surface of these right prisms 61A and 61B, a photo electric transducer element 64 is positioned on the axis after the pinhole 62A, and the emitting end face of the light spot guide 33 is arranged to the rear of the pinhole 62B. The pinhole 62A serves as a light receiving aperture in front of the photo electric transducer element 64, and is set in a position optically conjugate with the film surface 22. The principle of operation for focus state detection used in this second embodiment is illustrated in Figure 7. The focus state detecting light transmitted by the light spot guide 33 from the light source 32 passes through the pinhole 62B provided in one light intercepting plate 63B, to be reflected by the jointing surface of the prisms 61A and 61B and then projected toward the object 25 from the mirror 9 through the lens 8. The light reflected from the object 25 will pass back through the lens 8 and the prisms 61B and 61A, to be incident upon the other light intercepting plate 63A. If the lens 8 is in a correct focusing position, a convergent point will be formed at the position of the pinhole 62A, and therefore almost all of the reflected light will pass through the pinhole 62A to reach the photo electric transducer element 64.If the lens 8 is not in a correct focusing position, the light passing through the pinhole 62A to reach the photo electric transducer element 64 will be reduced. The output characteristics of the photo electric transducer element 64 will be as shown in Figure 8, as the output level for the correct focusing position will be a maximum value.The construction of the second embodiment is otherwise as described for the first embodiment, and the same reference numerals are used respectively for those elements that are identical in these two embodiments, and for those in the other Cmbodiments yet to be described. This second embodiment has substantially the same general operation and effect as the first embodiment. However, as compared with the above described embodiment, as separate light receiving and projecting apertures are provided, in the light intercepting plates 62A and 62B respectively, there is an advantage that no aperture needs to be provided in the photo electric transducer element 11 which is comparatively hard to work The beam splitter in the second embodiment can be formed by a semi transparent mirror instead of the prisms 61A and 61B. An endoscope automatic focusing device can be formed in the manner described for the first embodiment, but with the circuitry designed to seek the maximum output from the transducer. The respective pinholes, 62A and 62B, provided in the light intercepting plates 63A and 63B, may be apertures of any shape. The apertures in the first embodiment and this embodiment need to be optically transparent, but may be physically closed, i.e. glass or like material through which the light will pass may be present. If a filter is provided on the end face of the light spot guide 33 in the first and second embodiments, to selectively pass light of a specific wave length, the photo electric transducer elements 11 or 64 are of high sensitivity to light of this wave length the SN ratio will be improved. In the first and second embodiments, the endoscope focus state detecting focus setting device is formed within the camera adaptor 5 for a photographic or television camera to be fitted to the endoscope 4.However, the device may be contained within a camera designed for endoscopes and not requiring an adaptor.This comment applies also to the further embodiments to be described later. In each embodiment described above, the illuminating light of the light source 32 is branched out from the light guide 31 by the light spot guide 33 so that both recording illumination and focus state detecting illumination are obtained from a common source.However, if desired, the observing or photographing illumination may be stopped, e.gv by means of a shutter in the light path, during focus detection. Figure 9 shows a third exemplary embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment differs from the first and second embodiments, in that a separate light spot guide 33t is provided from a special light source 32 , separate from the light guide 31 transmitting the diagnosis illumination. The emitting end face of the light spot guide 33 is located just to the rear of the pinhole 15 of the photo electric element 11, as in the first described embodiment, but the incident end face of the light spot guide 33 extends out to be illuminated by light from a focus state detecting light source 32 . Parts other than those specially mentioned above are as in the first embodiment. As the light source 32 is separate from the diagnosis light source 32 different light may be used for example, in an infrared range different from the range of light wavelengths emitted by the light source 32, which will normally include the visible wavelengths, and this makes it possible to set the focus without interrupting observation or recording, and the influence of any external light, and of the diagnosis light can be reduced and focus detection established with high precision by use of an appropriately frequency selective transducer characteristic, possibly with the aid of a filter thereon. Figure 10 shows a fourth exemplary. embodiment which combines the third embodiment and the second embodiment. A beam splitter formed by jointing two right prisms 61A and 61B is arranged to the rear upper side as drawn in the illustration of the image re forming lens 10. Light intercepting plates 63A and 63B are bonded thereto so that the respective pinholes 62A and 62B act.as a light receiving aperture and light projecting aperture positioned on the right prisms 61A and 61B to be respectively to the rear on the optical axis reflected by the jointing surface of these right prisms 61A and 61B and on the optical axis passing through the jointing surface, so that a photo electric transducer element 64 and the emitting end face of the above mentioned light spot guide 33 may be positioned respectively to the rear of the pinholes 62A and 62B. The input end face of the light spot guide 33 is illuminated by light from the focus detecting light source 32 . The pinhole 62A acting as a light receiving aperture in front of the photo electric transducer element 64 is in a position optically conjugate with the surface of the film 22. The focus state detecting principle used in this fourth embodiment is the same as that used in the second embodiment, with the transducer output being at a maximum when focus is correctly set. In the third and fourth embodiments, one light source 32 is used for focus detection and a separate light source 32 is used for observation or recording purposes, i.e. for diagnosis illumination, but a common source can be used to supply two separate guides as in the fifth exemplary embodiment, details of which are shown in Figure 11. A diagnosis light source 32 passes some light through a semi silvered mirror 66 to be incident upon the input end face of the light spot guide 33 , whilst the rest of the light is reflected by the mirror 66 to enter the input end face of the light guide 31 directly or, as illustrated, after being further reflected by a reflecting mirror 67 or a triangular prism. Further, if a filter is provided on the input end face of the light spot guide 33 t in any embodiment, to select light of a specific wave length, and a transducer element is selected that has a high sensitivity to light of this specific wavfilength for use as the photo electric transducer element 11 or 64 t the SN ratio can be improved Figure 12 shows the sixth exemplary embodiment, wherein a diagnosis light transmitting light guide is utilised for a focus state detecting light projecting means. As shown in Figure 12 in the light guide 34 inserted through the insertion sheath 1 of the endoscope 4, light guide fibres inserted on the optical axis 7 or most adjacent to this optical axis at the output end of this light guide 34 are used as a light spot guide 34a, and are coupled to the input light guide cable 31 within the light guiding mouthpiece so that the illuminating light from the light source 32 via the light guide 31 may be transmitted on down the sheath.In the light guide 31, the fibres coupled at the mouthpiece 2 with the light spot guide 34a serve as a lightspot guide 31at and are so arranged that the illuminating light may be selectively fed only to the end face of the light spot guide 31a by adjusting a diaphragm 35 provided between the light source 32 and the input end face of the light guide 31, so as to project a spot toward the object 25 from the tip of the light spot guide 34a inserted via the insertion sheath 1. The diaphragm 35 is set to an open state when observing or recording, and the movement may be caused automatically by the operation of starting a recording exposure. The focus state detecting light receiving means is in the form of a photo electric transducer element provided with an aperture such as the pinhole 15, as in the first embodiment. The sixth embodiment, effectively operates to project a spot by restricting the diagnosis light, using the diaphragr 35 to shut off some of the light. In the sixth embodiment1 the photo electric transducer element 11 can have central zone 15a that is not photo sensitive, or that is provided with an opaque coating, for example, as shown in Figure 13, instead of providing an aperture such as the pinhole 15. The light receiving means used in the second embodiment can be used in place of the light receiving means shown in the sixth embodiment. If the diaphragm or stop 35 is formed by a filter so that light of a specific wavelength is selectively fed only to the light spot guide 31a, then even if normal illuminating light is simultaneously fed to the remaining light guide surface, the SN ratio can be improved, and observation and focus state detection can be carried out together.
