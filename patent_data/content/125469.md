# Conformationally constrained cyclic enkephalin analogs with delta receptor specificity.

## Abstract
Novel compounds which are capable of binding with enhanced specificity to the delta receptor are disclosed. The compounds are a series of cyclic, conformationally con strained analogs of enkephalins which display exceptional delta receptor specificity. The compounds of the present invention are polypeptides of the formula The novel compounds include those which have either agonist or antagonist activity. The compounds may be used to induce pharmacological or therapeutic effects, including analgesia, in humans and other animals.
