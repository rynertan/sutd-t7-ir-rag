## Description
THERMOPLASTIC POLYESTER LINEAR LOW DENSITY POLYETHLN E MOLDING COMPOSITIONS UNITED STATES PATENT APPLICkTION OF Ping Y. Liu Omar M. Boutni This invention relates to modified thermoplastic molding compositions having improved compatibility including weld line strength, reduced plate out, and improved mold releasability. High molecular weight linear polyesters and copolyesters of glycols and terephthalic or isophthalic acid have been available for a number of years. These are described inter alia in Whinfield et al, U.S. Patent No.2,465,319, and in Pengilly, U.S. Patent No. 3,047,539, both incorporated herein by reference. With the development of molecular weight control, the use of nucleating agents and two step molding cycles, poly ethylene terephthalate has become an important constituent of injection moldable compositions. Further, poly l, 4 butylene terephthalate , because of its very rapid crystallization from the melt, is uniquely useful as a component in such compositions.Work pieces molded from such polyester resins, in comparison with other thermoplastics, offer a high degree of surface hardness and abrasion resistance, high gloss and lower surface friction. Furthermore, the dimensional stability of poly l,4 butylene terephthalate injection moldings is very good even at temperatures near or well above the glass temperature of poly l,4 butylene terephthalate .Additionally in particular, poly l,4 butylene terephthalate is much simpler to use in injection molding techniques than poly ethylene terephthalate .For example, it is possible to injection mold poly l,4 butylene terephthalate at low temperatures of from about 300 to 600C to produce highly crystalline dimensionally stable moldings in short cycle times. Because of the high rate of crystallization, even at low temperatures, little difficulty is encountered in removing the moldings from the molds. Even so, it is desirable to provide molding compositions having improved mold releasability. It has been previously known to improve mold releasability, as shown by lower molding pressure, of thermoplastic polyester compositions, particularly poly ethylene terephthalate and poly l,4 butylene terephthalate , by incorporating therein high pressure low density polyethylene Cohene U.S. 4,185,047, incorporated by reference . However, it is also well known that high pressure low density polyethylene is not compatible therewith, resulting in blends with poor dispersion and a separating out of the low density polyethylene. Mathews et al U.S. 3,944,699 and Yamane et al U.S. 3,900,549 disclose thermoplastic polyester low density polyethylene blends which have improved opacity for films and spinnability for composite filaments, respectively. Here, however, it is believed the non compatibility accounts for the improvement.Similarly, Seydl et al U.S. 3,937,757 and McConnell et al U.S. 4,217,426 disclose such blends wherein tracking resistance and grindability are improved.Again, improvement in the properties is believed to be due to the non compatibility. It has also been found that high pressure low density polyethylene is a good impact modifier for thermoplastic polyesters U.S. 3,405,198 , however, only very small amounts of polyethylene may be used due to the non compatibility. It has recently been disclosed that linear low density polyethylene when added to an aromatic polycarbonate resin results in a molding composition that may be utilized for molded articles having improved weld line strength and heat stability. See ResearchDisclosure num 20810 P. 309 August 1981, incorporated herein by reference. Further, such compositions retain good impact strength and decrease the loss of other mechnical properties, such as tensile strength or heat distortion temperature under load, at increased part thickness as compared to control samples of either standard polycarbonate or a commerical polycarbonate blend with polyethylene. It has now been discovered that thermoplastic polyester molding compositions having improved compatibility, including weld line strength, reduced plate out, and improved flow and mold releasability may be produced by incorporating an effective amount of linear low density polyethylene into the compositions. These improvements are also found in mineral reinforced thermoplastic polyester compositions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to this invention, there are provided thermoplastic compositions which are useful for molding or extrusion, e.g., injection molding, injection blow molding, compression molding, transfer molding, profile extrusion, extrusion blow molding and the like, the compositions having improved compatibility and mold releasability comprising a a high molecular weight thermoplastic polyester resin, and b an effective amount of linear low density polyethylene LLDPE for improved compatibility and mold releasability. More specifically, the high molecular weight thermoplastic polyesters resin a to which the invention is applicable include i poly ethylene terephthalate , ii poly l,4 butylene terephthalate , iii an aliphatic aromatic co polyester derived from one or more dicarboxylic acids selected from the group consisting essentially of terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, naphthalene dicarboxylic acids, phenyl indane dicarboxylic acids, compounds of the formula EMI5.1 in which X may be aikylene or alkylidene of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, carbonyl, sulfonyl, oxygen or a bond between the benzene rings, and an aliphatic dicarboxylic acid having from 6 to 12 carbon atoms in the chain and one or more straight or branched chain aliphatic or cycloaliphatic glycols having from 2 to 10 carbon atoms in the chain. iv a block co polyester derived from terminally reactive blocks if i and ii , wherein said co polyester ii has at least 10 of aliphatic units being derived from a dicarboxylic acid, or a terminally reactive aliphatic polyester of a straight chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acid having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms in the chain and a straight or branched chain aliphatic glycol, said blocks being connected by interterminal linkages consisting essentially of ester linkages, v Blends of i, ii, iii and iv or any combination thereof. The compositions of this invention may also contain an aromatic polycarbonate to enhance impact strength.Furthermore, the compositions of the invention may also contain fillers, reinforcing agents, nucleating agents, flow promotors, colori g agents, flame retardants, stabilizers, impact modifiers and coupling agents in effective amounts. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The high molecular weight thermoplastic polyesters used in the practice of the invention are polymeric glycol esters of terephthalic acid and isophthalic acid. They are available commerically, e.g., General ElectricCompany, Pittsfield, Massachusetts under the Trademark VALOXe or can be prepared by known techniques, such as by the alcohoysis of esters of phthalic acid with a glycol and subsequent polymerization, by heating glycols with free acids of with halide derivatives thereof, and similar processes. These are described in U.S. PatentNo. 2,465,319 and U.S. Patent No. 3,047,539, and elsewhere. Although the glycol portion of the polyester can contain from 2 to 10 carbon atoms, it is preferred that it contain 2 to 4 carbon atoms in the form of linear alkylene chains. Preferred polyesters will be of the family consisting of high molecular weight, polymeric glycol terephthalates or isophthalates having repeating units of the general formula EMI6.1 wherein n is a whole number of from 2 to 4 , and mixtures of such esters, including co polyesters of terephthalic and isophthalic acids of up to 30 mole percent isophthalic units. Especially preferred polyesters are poly ethylene terephthalate and poly 1, 4 butylene terephthalate .Special mention is made of the latter because it crystallizes at such a good rate that it may be used for injection molding without the need for nucleating agents or long cycles, as is sometimes necessary with poly ethylene terephthalate . Illustratively, high molecular weight thermoplastic polyesters will have an intrinsic viscosity of at least about 0.4 decilliters gram and, preferaby, at least 0.7 decilliters gram as measured in a 60 40 phenol tetrachloroethane mixture at 300C. At intrinsic viscosities of at least about 1.1 decilliters gram, there is a further enhancement of toughness of the present compositions. The invention is also applicable to co polyesters which may be prepared by ester interchange in accordance with standard procedures. Preferably, the co polyesters are derived from terephthalic acid and or isophthalic acid and or derivatives thereof and a glycol, which may be a straight or branched chain aliphatic cycloaliphatic glycol. Illustratively, the glycol will be ethylene 1,4 butanediol 1,4 pentanediol 1,6 hexanediol 1,4 nonanediol 1,10 cyclohexanedimethanol, a mixture of any of the foregoing, or the like.Additional dicarboxylic acids suitable for the co polyesters include naphthalene dicarboxylic acids, phenyl indane dicarboxylic acid, compounds of the formulaEMI8.1 in which X may be alkylene or alkylidene of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, carbonyl, sulfonyl, oxygen, or a bond between the benzene rings, and aliphatic dicarboxylic acids having from 6 to 12 carbon atoms in the chain including but not limited to suberic acid, sebacic acid, azelaic acid, adipic acids and the like. Block co polyesters useful in the composition of this invention are prepared by the reaction of terminally reactive poly l,4 butylene terephthalate , preferably, low molecular weight, and a terminally reactive polyester or co polyester in the presence of a catalyst for transesterification, such as zinc acetate, manganese acetate, titanium esters and the like. The terminal groups can comprise hydroxyl, carboxyl, carboalkoxy, and the like, including reactive derivitives thereof. The result of a reaction between the two terminally reactive groups, of course, must be an ester linkage. After initial mixing, polymerization is carried out under standard conditions, e,g., 220 to 2800C., in a high vacuum, e,g., 0.1 to 2 mm Hg to form the block co polymer of minimum randomization in terms of distribution of claim segments. These block copolyesters are described in abandoned application Serial No. 752,325 filed December 20, 1976, incorporated herein by reference. The co polyester designated component of these block co polyesters may be terminally reactive segments of the co polyester as described herein above. Again, most preferably, these co polyesters are derived from an aliphatic glycol and an admixture of aromatic and aliphatic dibasic acids in which the mole ratio concentration of aromatic to aliphatic acids is from 1 to 9 to about 9 to 1, with an especially preferred range of from 3 to 7 to about 7 to 3. The terminally reactive aliphatic polyester designated component of the block co polyester will contain substantially stoichiometric amounts of the aliphatic diol and the aliphatic dicarboxylic acid, although hydroxy containing terminal groups are preferred. In addition to their ease of formation by well known procedures, both the aromatic aliphatic co polyesters and the aliphatic polyester suitable for use in the block co polymers are commercially available.One source for such materials is the RucoDivision Hooker Chemical Company, Hicksville, New York, which designates its compounds as Rucoflex . The block co polyesters used in the invention preferably comprise from 95 to 50 parts by weight of poly 1, 4 butylene terephthalate segments. The poly l,4 butylene terephthalate blocks, before incorporation into the block co polyesters, as well as the co polyester described herein above, will preferably have an intrinsic viscosity of above 0.1 dl g and preferably, between 0.1 and 0.5 dl g, as measured in a 60 40 mixture of phenol tetrachloroethane at 300C. The balance, 50 to 5 parts by weight of the block co polyester will comprise blocks of the aforementioned aliphatic aromatic co polyesters and or aliphatic polyesters.. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, the poly l,4 butylene terephthalate block can be straight chain or branched, e.g., by use of a branching component, e.g., 0.5 to 1 mole percent, based on terephthalate units, of a branching component which contains at least 3 ester forming groups. This can be a glycol, e.g. pentacrythritol, trimethylolpropane, and the like or a poly basic acid compound, e.g., trimethyl trimestate, and the like. The invention is also applicable to blends of poly ethylene terephthalate , poly l,4 butylene terephthalate , the foregoing copolyesters and or block co polyesters and or derivatives thereof, or any combination of these. The linear low density polyethylene useful for the present invention are well known materials, they are available commerically, e.g. from Exxon under the tradename Escorene or from Dow Chemicals under the tradename DOWLEX. Alternatively, they may readily be prepared by state of the art polymerization processes such as those described in U.S. 4,354,009, U.S. 4,q76,698, European Patent Application 4645 published 10 17 79 , and U.S. 4,128,607, all incorporated herein by reference. These polymers have a density between about 0.89 and about 0.96 gram cc, preferably between about 0.915 and 0.945 grams cc. These linear low density polyethylene polymers are actually co polymers of ethylene and a minor amount, less than 20 mole percent, preferably less than 15 mole , of an alpha oleo in of 3 to 18 cabbon atoms, preferably 3 to 10 carbon atoms, most preferably 4 to 8 carbon atoms.These linear low density polyethylenes are distinguishable from polymers such as high pressure low density polyethylene and high density polyethylene made from Zeigler catalyst systems in that they are substantially free of side chain branching, having a controlled concentration of simple side chain branching as opposed to random branching. The preferred linear low density polyethylene co polymers are prepared from ethylene and one or more alpha olefines selected from the group consisting of propylene, butene l, pentene l, 4 methyl pentene l, hexene l and octene l, most preferably butene l and octene l. Polymers of desired density may be obtained by controlling the co polymerization ratio of alpha oleo in and the formation proportion of the polymer during co polymerization. The addition of increasing amounts of the co monomers to the co polymers results in lowering the density of the co polymer. The melt viscosities of the linear low density polyethylenes useful for the present invention using linear low density polyethylene derived from ethylene and a short chain, e.g. butene l, monomer, it is preferred that such linear low density polyethylenes have a melt viscosity of at least 5, preferrably at least 10, most preferrably at least about 12 gm 10 min.With linear low density polyethylenes derived from longer chain, e.g. octene l, monomers, the melt viscosities of the linear low density polyethylenes may be over lover. v In general, the co polymerization of linear low density polyethylene can take place in either a gas phase fluidized bed reaction or liquid phase solution process reactor, preferably the former, at pressures ranging from normal to 5000 psi, preferably less than 1000 psi and at temperatures of from 20 C to 310 C, preferably 300C to 1150C in the presence of a suitable high activity catalysts.Typical catalyst systems comprise transition metal complex catalyst preferably composed of at least one compound of a transition element of groups IVa, Va, and VIa having a halide and or hydrocarbon group attached to said transition metal and a reducing component such as a metal halide or a compound having metal attached directly to carbon, e.g. metal alkyl. Highly satisfactory catalyst systems have a halide on titanium and wherein the effective organo metallic components are metal alkyl compounds having aluminum as the metal, especially Li A1 hydrocarbon 4. Such systems include for example TiC14 LiAl alkyl 4, VOCL3 Li a lkyl , MoC13 BR Al Alkyl 3, TiC14 alkyl Mg Br, etc.Catalyst systems such as these as well as other useful catalysts systems are disclosed in U.S. 4,354,009, U.S. 4,076,698, Eur. Application 4645 and U.S. 4,128,607 above. Such catalyst systems are used in a molar ratio of ethylene to catalyst in a range of 35,000 to 400,000 to one. The preferred linear low density polyethylene co polymers so produced have an unsaturated group content of 1 and preferably from about 0.1 to about 0.3 C C 1000.oarbon atoms and a n hexane extractables content at 500C of less than about 3 preferably less than 2 weight percent. The preferred materials are made by the Unipol process which is described in Chem. Eng., Dec. 3, 1979, pp. 80 85 which is incorporated by reference. Additionally, these high molecular weight thermoplastic polyester linear low density polyethylene blends may also have added thereto, an aromatic polycarbonate to enhance impact strength. The aromatic polycarbonates useful in the invention include any of these known in the art. Generally speaking, those aromatic polycarbonates may be prepared by reacting a dihydric phenol with a carbonate precursor such as phosgene, a haloformate or a carbonate ester in accordance with the methods set forth in U.S. 2,993,835 3,028,365 4,018,750 and 4,123,436 or by transesterification processes such as are disclosed inU.S. Patent No. 3,153,008,all incorporated herein by reference, as well as other processes known to those skilled in the art. The polycarbonates so produced are typified as possessing recurring structural units of the formula EMI14.1 where A is a divalent aromatic radical of the dihydric phenol employed in the polymer producing reaction. Generally these high molecular weight aromatic carbonate polymers have intrinsic viscosities as measured in methylene chloride in deciliters gram at 250C of greater than about 0.30. The dihydric phenols which may be employed to provide such aromatic carbonate polymers are mononuclear or polynuclear aromatic compounds, containing as functional groups, two hydroxyl radicals, each of which is attached directly to a carbon atom of an aromatic nucleus. Typical dihydric phenols are 2, 2bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl pentane 2,2 bis 4 hydroxy 3 methylphenyl propane 2,2 bix 4 hydroxy 3,5 dichlorophenyl propane 2,2 bis 4 hydroxy 3,5 dibromophenyl propane 1,1 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl ethane 4,4 dihdroxy 3,3 dichlorodiphenylether.Most preferably, the polycarbonates to be used for the present invention are those prepared from 2, 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane. A variety of additional dihydric phenols which may be employed to provide such carbonate polymers are disclosed inGoldberg, U.S. Patent No. 2,993,835, assigned to the assignee of the present invention, incorporated by reference. It is of course possible to employ two or more different dihydric phenols or a dihydric phenol in combination with a glycol, a hydroxy or acid terminated polyester, or a dibasic acid in the event a carbonate co polymer rather than a homopolymer is desired for use in the practice of the invention. Thus, it should be understood that the term polycarbonate resin embraces within its scope carbonate co polymers. Furthermore, the composition of the present invention may further comprise an effective amount of any of the known impact modifiers useful for polyesters and polyester blends. These may be added to the compositions by themselves or in combination with the aforementioned aromatic polycarbonates. The preferred impact modifiers generally comprise an acrylic or methacrylic grafted polymer of conjugated diene or an acrylate elastomer, alone or co polymerized with a vinyl aromatic compound. Especially preferred grafted polymers are the core shell polymers of the type available from Rohm Haas, for example Acryloid KM653,Acryloid KM330 and Acryloid KM611. In general these impact modifiers contain units derived from butadiene or isoprene, alone or in combination with a vinyl aromatic compound, or n butyl acrylate, alone or in combination with a vinyl aromatic compound. The aforementioned impact modifiers are believed to be disclosed in Fromuth et. al. U.S. 4,180,494 Owens U.S. 3,808,180 Farnham et. al. U.S. 4,096,202 and Cohen et al U.S. 4,260,693, all incorporated herein by reference. Most preferably, the impact modifier will comprise a two stage polymer having either a butadiefle or n butyl acrylate based rubbery core and a second stage polymerized from methymethacrylate alone or in combination with styrene.Also present in the first stage are cross linking monomers and graft linking monomers. Examples of the cross linking monomers include 1,3 butylene diacrylate, divinyl benzene and blztylene dimethacrylate. Examples of graft linking monomers are allyl acrylate, allyl methacrylate and diallyl maleate. Additional preferred impact modifiers are of the type disclosed in U.S. 4,292,233, incorporated by reference. These impact modifiers comprise, generally, a relatively high content of a cross linked butyldienepolymer grafted base having grafted thereon acryonitrile and styrene. Other suitable impact modifiers include, but are not limited to ethylene vinyl acetate, ethylene ethylacrylate copolymers, etc. Optionally, the compositions of this invention may further contain one or more reinforcing agents.Typical reinforcing agents useful for the invention include but are not limited to, glass fiber, mica or both. The filamentous glass that may be used in the embodiments of this invention is well known to those skilled in the art and is widely available from a number of manufacturers. The glass may be untreated or, preferably, treated with silane or titanate coupling agents, etc. For compositions ultimately to be employed for electrical uses, it is preferred to use fibrous glass filaments comprised of lime aluminum borosilicate glass that is relatively soda free. This is known as E glass. However, other glasses are useful where electrical properties are not so important, e.g., the low soda glass known as C glass. The filaments are made by standard processes, e.g., by steam or air blowing, flame blowing and mechanical pulling. The preferred filaments for plastic reinforcement are,made by mechanical pulling. The length of the glass filaments and whether or not they are bundled into fibers and the fibers bundled in turn to yarns, ropes or rovings, or woven into mats, and the like, are also not critical to the invention.However, in preparing the molding compositions, it is convenient to use the filamentous glass in the form of chopped strands of from about one eighth to about 2 inches long. In articles molded from the compositions, on the other hand, even shorter lengths will be encountered because, during compounding, considerable fragmentation will occur. This is desirable, however, because the best properties are exhibited by thermoplastic injection molded articles in which the filament lengths lie between about 0.0005 to 0.125 inch. The linear low density polyethylene modified polyesters of this invention can be rendered flame retardant with an effective amount of a conventional flame retardant agent. As is well known, flame retardants can be based on elementary red phosphorus, phosphorous compounds, halogen and nitrogen compounds alone or preferably in further combination with synergists, such as antimony compounds. Especially useful are polymeric and oligomeric flame retardant agents comprising tetrabromo bisphenol A carbonate units, e.g., Wambach U.S. Patent No. 3,833,685, incorporated herein by reference. Other ngredient s such as dyes, pigments, drip retardants, flow promoters, fillers especially mineral fillers , nucleating agents, coupling agents, and stabilizers, and the like, can be added in effective amounts known in the art for their conventionally employed purposes. Generally, suitable stabilizer systems include a a hindered phenolic antioxidant, b an aromatic amine, c a thioester and d optionally, a trivalent phosphorus compound, e.g., a phosphite. The formulation and the proportionment of ingredients of the compositions of the invention vary depending upon the desired properties and end use of the final compositions.In general the compositions comprise in percent by weight based on the total composition, about 99 to 10 polyester resin a about 0.1 to 20 , preferably about 0.5 to 14 , most preferably about 1 5 linear low density polyethylene b .Furthermore, in addition to the aforementioned polyester linear low density polyethylene compositions, such compositions further comprising up to 70 by weight of an aromatic polycarbonate are within the scope of the invention. The above compositions may also contain 0 to 25 percent by weight, preferably 5 to 20 percent, of an impact modifier or 0 to 50 of a reinforcing agent.Finally, the various stabilizers and like agents can be present in amounts of from about 0.05 to 5 by weight based on the total compositions. Preferred amounts depend upon the particular agent used and the results desired. The copipositions of the present invention are prepared in conventional ways. For example, in one method, the linear low density polyethylene, and impact modifier and other ingredients, if used, are all placed into an extrusion compounder with the thermoplastic polyester resin to produce molding pellets. The linear low density polyethylene and other ingredients are dispersed in a matrix of the thermoplastic polyester in the process. In another procedure, the linear low density polyethylene and the other above identified ingredients, if used, are mixed with the thermoplastic polyester resin by dry blending, then either fluxed on a mill and comminuted, or then are extruded and chopped.Alternatively, the ingredients can also be mixed with the powdered or granular thermoplastic polyester resin and directly molded, e.g., by injection or transfer molding techniques. It is always important to thoroughly free the thermoplastic resin, linear low density polyethylene and the other aforementioned ingredients, if used, from as much water as possible. In addition, compounding should be carried out to insure that the residence time in the machine is short the temperature is carefully controlled the friction heat is utilized, and an intimate blend between the additives and the thermoplastic resin is obtained. Although it is not essential, best results are obtained if the ingredients are pre compounded, pelletized, and then molded. Pre compounding can be carried out in conventional equipment. For example, after carefully preying the thermoplastic polyester, e.g., at 1250C for 4 hours, a single screw extruder is fed with a dry blend of the polyester resin a and the linear low density polyethylene and, any other aboveidentified ingredients to be used, the screw employed having a long transition and metering section to insure melting. On the other hand, a twin screw extrusion machine, e.g., a 28mm Werner Pfleiderer machine can be fed with resin, linear low density polyethylene and additives, if used, at the feed port. In either case, a generally suitable machine temperature will be about 450 to 5700F. The pre compounded composition can be extruded and put up into molding compounds such as conventional granules, pellets, etc., by standard techniques. The compositions of this invention can be molded in any equipment conventionally used for thermoplastic compositions. For example, with poly l,4 butylene terephthalate good results will be obtained in an injection molding machine, e.g., of the Newbury type with conventional mold temperatures, e.g., 1500F. On the other hand, with poly ethylene terephthalate , because of the lack of uniformity of crystallization from interior to exterior of thick pieces, somewhat less conventional but still well known techniques can be used. For example, a nucleating agent such as LiOH, graphite or a metal oxide, e.g., ZnO or MgO, can be included and standard mold temperatures of at least 230OF will be used. In order that those skilled in the art may better understand. how to practice the present invention, the following examples are given by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. The term Double gate is used to refer to the preparation of a molded sample in a mold having two entry ports that result in a weld line at the juncture of the fluid resin in the mold during the molding cycle.The design preparation of the molded part and testing of the following examples are according to ASTM D256. Examples E1 E4 Comparative Examples CE1 CE3 Dry blends of poly l,4 butylene terephthalate , linear low density polyethylene and antioxidant stabilizer were compounded and extruded through a single screw extruder at 450 5000F.

The impact modified polyester polycarbonate blends of examples E7 Ell showed good compatibility, this weld line strength, as evidenced by the high values obtained for double gate unnotched izod. Implicit with such results and as experienced, those compositions did not suffer the plate out problems encountered in similar compositions having high pressure low density polyethylene. Futhermore, these compositions had improved flow and mold release properties as well as retention of good notched izod impact strengths. Examples E9 and E10 show the applicability of this invention to compositions also containing copolycarbonates. Finally, example Ell shows that higher amounts of low pressure, linear low density polyethalene may be used, however with increasing amounts some less of compatibility maybe experienced. Obviously, other modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is, therefore, to be understood that changes may be made in the particular embodiments of the invention described which are within the full intended scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
