# DNA fragments, expression vectors, proteins, hosts, and process for production of the proteins.

## Abstract
The invention provides DNA fragments coding for hu man apolipoprotein E or human apoliproprotein E like sub stances having physiological activities equivalent to those of said human apolipoprotein E, expression vectors suitable for production of such proteins, hosts for use in the produc tion, and process for the pruction, as well as such proteins thereby produced.
