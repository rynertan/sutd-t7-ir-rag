# Organopolysiloxane emulsifier compositions and method therefor.

## Abstract
Siloxane oxyalkylene block copolymer compositions are prepared by a hydrosilylation reaction, using a saturat ed higher alcohol, such as isostearyl alcohol, as the reac tion solvent. The reaction solvent need not be removed from the resulting block copolymer, particularly when the block copolymer is used as an emulsifier in personal care compo sitions.
