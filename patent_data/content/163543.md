# MARROW CELL STIMULATOR

## Abstract
A biologically active composition isolated from thymus tissue, capable of enhancing the growth of pluripotent and lymphopoietic cells in bone marrow culture systems, com prising a factor which is heat stable to approximately 80 C, which has a high charge to mass ratio, and which is essentially free of serum albumin. A process for isolating the composition from thymus tissue is described together with compositions comprising the biologically active composition for use as a supplement for in vitro cultures, such as bone marrow cultures and as a therapeutic composition from bone marrow dysfunction and for use in bone marrow transplant procedures. An antibody to the biologically active composition is described together with therapeutic and diagnostic reagents comprising same.
