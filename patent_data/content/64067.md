## Description
The invention relates to a methodfor generating a diffractive graphical composition. Holography has been used widely for thegeneration of diffractive gratings US A 3,578,845 and three dimensional images ofobjects and scenes US A 3,506,327 US A 3,580,655 US A 3,758,186 . To make a diffractiongrating, the interference pattern formed bythe interference between two or more mutuallycoherent optical wavefronts usually one sphericalor planar wavefront and another spherical,cylindrical, or planar wavefront is recorded on ahigh resolution optical recording medium, suchas a Lippman emulsion, photopolymer, photoresist,or dichromated gelatin. Such diffractiongratings are used in spectrophotometers, heads updisplays, and other optical instruments. To make a three dimensional image, the interferencepattern formed by the interferencebetween a spherical or planar wavefront and acomplex wavefront formed by the reflection ofcoherent light from the surface of an object or bytransmission of coherent light through an object is recorded on a high resolution photographicmedium. Alternatively, a three dimensionalimage may be synthesized as described inUS A 4,206,965 by recording a large number oftwo dimensional views of an object, in which caseeach individual recording step usually involvesonly the interference between a spherical orplanar reference wavefront and a spherical.planar, or other wavefront carrying a two dimensionalimage. An improved form of holography to recordthree dimensional images, described in US A 3,633,989,reduces or eliminates all vertical parallaxand thereby allows unblurred reconstructionwith a white light source. As a consequence, theimage appears in nearly pure spectral colours.Later exensions of the technique have includedmultiple images, each with different recordingconditions to produce multi coloured, three dimensionalimages 9 . US A 4,017,158 discloses a method for forminga transparency for reproducing preselectedarea delineations in colours and intensitiesthereof variable at will by using an interferencepattern formed holographically by the interferenceof a split laser beam. A reference beamand an object beam are directed onto a recordingmedium at a fixed angle. Furthermore, the wavefrontof the object beam incident on the recordingmedium is spacially coherent. Consequently, thediffraction pattern formed on the recordingmedium is a linear diffraction grating. The angleof the diffraction grating on each discreete area ofthe recording medium may be varied from area toarea. If the linear diffraction grating is vieweddirectly with the linear diffraction grating positionedbetween a viewer and a light source andthe light beam forming a predetermined anglewith the plane of the linear diffraction grating,then the area covered by the diffraction gratingwould not appear to be of the same colour.Instead, a rainbow of colours would be visible.Furthermore, since the object wavefront incidenton the recording medium is spacially coherent,the rainbow of colours would not be visible froma wide range of angles. For these reasons, thehologram produced in accordance with saidknown method cannot be viewed directly, andneeds instead an elaborate arrangement illustratedin said patent specification. Radially symmetric mechanically ruled diffractiongratings, especially spiral gratings, havebeen used to provide decorative colour effects.Segments of spiral gratings have been joined toform diffractive mosaic patterns. These gratingsand grating mosaics have been generated assurface relief patterns and have been replicatedby thermoplastic embossing. The embossed diffractiongrating mosaics have been used as substratesfor printed graphics. In some instances, simple holographicallygenerated diffraction gratings have been replicatedby emoossing and used as decorativematerial. In such instances, the diffraction gratingshave been limited to low frequency, verysimply, nonrandom patterns.From Optical Engineering , 1980, page 666, ff., a one steprainbow holographic process is known for the generation ofcolor hologram images for archival storage of color filmsand for the generation of pseudocolor holographic imaging.Mr. Yu, the author of this article, uses one or more inputtransparencies, a Fourier transform lens combined with acomplex spatial filter for encoding, a diffusor, one or moreimaging lenses and a set of slits. In one specificembodiment described in Section IX of this article, the word optics is recorded so that different letters appear indifferent colors. Encoding was performed at the ground glassplate. The input transparency and the slit position werechanged for each color component. The task to be solved by the invention is to formgraphical compositions having new visible effects. The solution of this task is obtained by the method specified in the claim. The present invention uses holographicallygenerated diffractive patterns in the graphic arts much as paint or coloured inks have previouslybeen used to form artistic compositions anddecorative patterns of predetermined colour,apparent texture and apparent motion. Thesecompositions and patterns are not the three dimensionalimages which are a goal of holography they are confined to the surface they aremade upon. No three dimensionality beyondperhaps a slight depth of texture or a possiblekinetic illusion of depth is to be expected. The invention provides the advantage of amethod for generating new and useful colour,texture and kinetic effects in graphical compositions.The invention further provides a system forproducing colours without the use of pigments.Additionally, the invention provides also meansfor easily composing graphical patterns incorporatingdiffractive effects, utilizing relatively simple and inexpensive equipment without the needfor the complex and expensive equipmentnormally associated with holography. A furtheradvantage of the invention is to teach a method ofproducing graphical compositions which aredifficult to counterfeit for use in validating documents,labels, stamps, currencies, identificationcards and other items whose value depends ontheir genuiness. The diffractive patterns are used in any ofseveral ways. First, a graphical composition maybe made directly on the holographicmedium by placing a first mask upon theholographic medium to limit a first exposure tocertain areas, changing the mask and altering thesetup to record a second diffractive pattern on asecond set of predetermined areas, and continuingin this fashion until the desired composition isformed. The composition may then be replicatedby contact printing, embossing, injection molding,or other suitable means. Secondly, the diffractive patterns may be usedto compose graphical designs by using thepatterns themselves as contact printing masks. Inthis case, a further holographic recording medium isexposed through selected contact printable diffractivepatterns placed in contact, and exposure islimited to predetermined areas by a selected mask.Further exposures through further diffractivepatterns and further masks are used to composethe desired graphical design. Embodiments for carrying out the invention aredescribed in detail below with reference to drawings,in which In figure 1 the production ofconventional holograms of several different texturedsurfaces is shown.Textured surface 100 is illuminated by laser light.Scattered light from surface 100 is incident uponholograonic plate 110. Holographic plate 110 isilluminated by collimated laser light 130 derivedfrom the same laser as light 120. Plate 110 is tiltedwith respect to surface 100 so that the extendedplanes of plate 110 and surface 100 intersect at line150, whose center point is 160. The interferencepattern formed by collimated light 130 and lightscattered from surface 100 upon plate 110 is aconventional hologram of textured surface 100,with the exception that plate 110 is tilted at apreselected angle 170. The purpose of the tilt ofplate 110 is explained in the following sections. In the second step, a hologram such as recordedon plate 110 in Figure 1 may be used in the setupshown in Figure 2 to produce a diffractive patternof any chosen color having the texture of therecorded surface e.g., surface 100 . In Figure 2, thesurface recorded in hologram 200 e.g., surface100 in hologram 110 is imaged onto the surface ofholograpnic plate 210 by reconstructing hologram200 with collimated laser light beam 220. Light from the same laser source as beam 220 isdiverged from point 230 to illuminate plate 210,thereby forming an interference pattern uponplate 210 comprising a hologram of the surfacerecorded in hologram 200. Means such as mask240 is employed to select the portions of hologram200 contributing to the reconstruction of said surface. Point 230 is located on line 250, which isthe line which passes through point 260 and thecenter of plate 200. Line 270 is the intersection ofthe extended planes of plate 200 and plate 210 point 260 is the midpoint of line 270. The diffractive pattern on plate 210 is illuminatedas indicated schematically in Figure 3. At aposition 300, which is found by extending a line330 from light source 320 through point 260 seeFigure 2 and finding the intersection of line 330with line 310 extending normal to plate 210, thecontribution of each horizontal strip 280 of hologram200 defined by mask 240 will be a monochromaticimage of the surface recorded in hologram200. For best results, point 260 Figures 2 and3 corresponds to point 160 Figure 1 . The particularcolor of the monochromatic image contributiondepends on the color of laser light usedin forming the diffractive pattern on plate 210 andthe angular separation of point 230 and strip 280as seen from the midpoint of plate 210. What isactually observed at point 300 is the superpositionof substantially identical images of a texturedsurface, each image being in a different color. Theresult is a diffractive pattern having the texture ofa surface and a color distribution determined bymask 240 of Figure 2. A complex mask 240 can produce a complexpattern of color distributions that change withdifferent viewpoints. Plate 110 is tilted relative tosurface 100 in Figure 1 so that, according toFigure 3, light source 320 can be located relativelyclose to plate 210. The diffractive pattern on plate210, resulting from reconstructing only a thinhorizontal strip of hologram 200, will generate amonochromatic field at position 300. Each horizontalstrip of hologram 200 will produce a differentcolor monochromatic field at position 300only if point 230, point 260, and the entire platebearing hologram 200 all lie on a straight line. Ifthe plate bearing hologram 200 is parallel tosurface 100 and thus to plate 210 , then point 260is removed to infinity and consequently point 300and light source 320 are also removed to infinity ifeach horizontal strip of hologram 200 is to contributea monochromatic field. When it is desired that the diffractive pattern isto be illuminated by a distant source effectivelyat infinity , such as the sun, and that the pattern isto be viewed from a large distance, such as acrossa street, the plate bearing hologram 200 shouldbe parallel to plate 210, and point 230 should be inthe extended plane of hologram 200. Consequently,plate 110 should be parallel to surface100. If the above arrangements are not employed, avertically bearing color distribution will result. If avertically varying color distribution such as a fullrainbow spectrum is desired, the relationshipbetween points 260, 160, 320, and 300, as indicatedin Figures 1, 2, and 3, may be altered. While it is preferable to generate diffractivepatterns with predetermined color distribution byusing a simple reference beam and a complexobject beam, it is also practical to use a complexreference beam. The essential characteristic ofthe optical system is that the resulting interfencepattern itself should closely resemble a patternmade by the above described methods. Such aninterference pattern is characterized by the diffractiveeffects it produces it diffuses light moreor less uniformly in the horizontal direction, and itdiffuses light in the vertical direction according toan angular distribution which results in a predeterminedmix of colors. The light wavefrontswhose interference produces such a pattern arecharacterized by a substantial degree of spatialincoherence in the horizontal direction and aselected distribution of spatial incoherence in thevertical direction. Spatial incoherence as usedhere means a complex spatial phase dependenceof high spatial frequency with negligible timedependence. To form a graphical composition of severaltextures and colors directly on plate 210,exposures are made on plate 210 using differentholograms 200 and masks 240 for each exposure.Separate masks 214 may be used to limit eachexposure to a different predetermined region onplate 210 and thereby compose a graphical imageor pattern. The term graphical composition as usedherein means an arrangement of colored or texturedareas on a surface wherein the arrangementitself forms a desired picture, image, or pattern.The color and texture effects described herein areused in much the same way that paints might beused to form such a graphical composition. Diffractive patterns formed as in Figure 2 arepreferably used in a third step, as illustrated inFigure 4. A mask 420 allows light 430 to passthrough diffractive pattern 410 in preselectedregions 440 to expose holographic plate 400,thereby contact printing a replica of diffractionpattern 410 onto plate 400 in regions 440. Furtherexposures may be made onto plate 400 usingdifferent patterns 410 and masks 420 to composea desired graphical pattern. If pattern 410 is insufficiently close contact with plate 400, theexposure may be made with light from an incandescentor arc light source. However, using alaser light source will avoid numerous problemsthat can arise, such as might be caused by thepresence of dust particles between plates 400 and410. The diffractive effects described above are notexclusively applicable to flat shapes. The essentialaspects of the invention are equally applicableto other shapes, such as spheres, toruses, cylinders,cones, and so on. For a textural effect towork well on such shapes, the shape of the realimage bearing the desired textural effect shouldbe approximately the same shape as the surfaceof the photosensitive medium onto which it isimaged. That is, the real image should be conformalto the shape of the photo sensitive medium.Furthermore, the terms vertical and horizontal which are used herein refer to a relationshipbetween the optical system and the diffractivepattern being formed, with vertical being thedirection orthogonal to horizontal , and horizontal being a direction in the pattern substantiallyparallel to the line joining an observer stwo eyes in the arrangement used to display andview the final graphical composition. The reference beam used to make the above describedholographic diffractive patterns may beincident upon either side of the photosensitiverecording medium. That is, the holographicpattern may be of the front beam or the back beamtype. However, it is preferable for thepattern to be of the front beam type for mostapplications, such as applications wherein thepattern will be replicated as a surface reliefpattern. A specific example of making diffractivepatterns in a graphical composition incorporatingdiffractive color and texture effectsis as follows. Employing the setup of Figure 1, a woodenplank is used to provide surface 100 with a wood grainedtexture. Plate 110 is a glass plate coatedwith dichromated gelatin. Exposure is made with200 millijoules per square centimeter at a beamratio R 0 of 20 1 using the 4579 nm line of anargon ion laser. Line 150 is removed to infinity sothat plate 110 is parallel to surface 100. Plate 110is placed 61 cm away from surface 100. Afterexposure, plate 110 is developed in water andisopropanol to yield a dichromated gelatin hologram. Then, developed plate 110 is used as hologramin Figure 2. Employing the setup of Figure 2, aglass plate 210 is coated with a suitable photoresistand is exposed using a reference source 230placed so as to form an angle 290 of 35 degrees.Plate 200 is placed 61 cm away from and parallelto plate 210, and is reconstructed with 4579argon ion laser light. A mask 240 with a singlehorizontal transparent strip 280 is placed overhologram 200. Strip 280 is located in a directiondirectly normal to the center of plate 210. Anothermask 214, comprising a positive transparency of aphotograph of a human face, is placed on plate210. An exposure of 100 millijoules per squarecentimeter and a beam ratio R 0 of 1 1 is used.THE resist coated plate is developed for oneminute in a suitably diluted developer to generatea surface relief interference pattern. The pattern isthen vacuum coated with aluminum to achieve atransmissivity of 2 percent, and finally coveredwith a glass plate which is attached with ultraviolet curedoptical cement. This graphical compositionis viewed reflectively at a distance byilluminating it with a distant spotlight at an angleof 45 degrees. The composition appears as a flatyellow green image of the human face bearing awood grained texture. The embodiment described so far do not form part of the invention. Graphical compositions formed from diffractivepatterns generated using a diffuser as mentioned in the claim have a widerange of utility and are relatively easier to producethan those formed using a hologram 200. An example according to the invention is as follows A set of three transmissive diffractive patternsis made as in the setup of Figure 2 using a long,narrow horizontal strip of opal glass as a diffuserinstead of a hologram for the plate. That plate islocated 30.5 cm away from a holographic plate210. A reference source a microscope objectivewith a pinhole filter at its focus is placed so thatangle 290 is 38 degrees for the first pattern, 46degrees for the second pattern, and 58 degreesfor the third pattern. Exposure is determined bythe plate manufacturer s recommendation, usinga helium neon laser. Each of the three plates isdeveloped in a suited developer and bleached iniodine methanol bleach. When the plates areilluminated by a flashlight bulb located at 40degrees angle 290 in Figure 3 at a distance of43.2 cm, an observer 91.44 cm away sees the firstplate as a uniform red field, the second plate as auniform green field, and the third plate as auniform blue field. These plates may now be usedas contact printable diffractive patterns. In further embodiment,a series of diffractive patterns are firstformed in a surface relief medium, such as photoresistor gum bichromate. A metal plate replica ofeach pattern is formed by electroless depositionof nickel onto the surface relief medium or areplica thereof, followed by electrodeposition ofnickel according to techniques well known tothose skilled in the art of electroforming. Thenickel plates thus formed may be replicated bytechniques also well known to those skilled in theart. A diffractive graphical composition can beformed as an embossing plate using the nickelplate replicas as follows First, the replica plates are coated with a photoresist.Regions of the plates are exposed to lightand developed to uncover the metal in predeterminedpatterns. The metal in the uncoveredregions is deeply etched and the photoresist isremoved from the covered regions. Plates areobtained wherein in the elevated unetched regions bear relief diffractive patterns. These plates may be used as embossing dies insequence to produce a graphical composition incombining the patterns from the various plates. Alternative ways to emboss diffractive graphicalcompositions are apparent, such as to form acomposition on a single metal plate or to mechanicallyjoin parts from different plates to form asingle plate. The term embossing , as usedherein, means impressing a relief pattern onto asurface by any means, such casting, molding, hotstamping, or calendaring. In a further preferred embodiment, the inventionis applied to security device or anticounterfeitingdevice. Graphical compositions formed fromcomplex diffractive patterns are extraordinarilydifficult to counterfeit. They are much more finelydetailed from the finest engraving, yet they caneasily be recognized by eye. For example, aconcert ticket, stock certificate, or other such itemwhose value depends on its genuineness mayhave a particular diffractive graphical compositionembossed therein or affixed thereto. Tocounterfeit the item would require counterfeitingthe diffractive composition, which is not possibleby the methods normally employed by printers,such as photocopying. If the composition is to be viewed by eitherreflected or transmitted light, and if it is embossed,it may be covered by a transparent coating ofa material having a different refractive index thanthe embossed material. If the composition is to beviewed by reflected light, and is embossed, it maybe coated with a thin layer of aluminum or othermaterial to enhance its reflectivity, then overcoatedwith a transparent material. It is important to bury the embossed surface beneath a transparentcoating both to protect it from damage andto prevent direct mechanical copying of theembossed pattern. Paper itself is not usually asuitable material to be embossed, but papercoated with a thermoplastic, such as polyethylene,is suitable. If a reflective, embossed, diffractive compositionis employed as a security device, it is bestprotected by a transparent material whichadheres strongly. One way to assure strongadhesion while employing a reflective interlayer,such as aluminum, is to remove or displace theinterlayer at many points which are small comparedto the details of the composition, and todirectly fuse a covering layer to the embossedsubstrate at those points. A way to form a virtuallyuncounterfeitable, embossed, diffractivecomposition on a paper substrate is to apply alarge number of small, noncontiguous dots ofembossable material to the substrate. Alternatively,a layer of embossable material withmultiple connectivity such as having missingspots may be applied. The composition isembossed onto the top surface of the embossablematerial and then aluminized. A transparent overcoatis applied which penetrates the fibers of thepaper substrate. The resulting structure is verydifficult to disassemble without destroying thediffractive pattern.
