## Description
Pipeline leak location THE PRESENT INVENTION relates to an improved method for detecting the position of a leak in a pipeline containing a fluid under pressure. The use of pipelines, both on land and under the sea, to carry liquids and gases has increased appreciably in recent years and continues to increase.Transport by pipeline is convenient and more economical than other means of transportation and once laid, pipelines require little maintenance and generally can be used for long periods of time, measured in years, before major servicing is required. However an ever present risk in the use of pipelines is that the line may rupture and allow an escape of gas or liquid. There is therefore a need for an apparatus and method which will enable a pipeline operator to have both rapid warning of an escape of liquid or gas from the pipeline and an accurate indication of the location of the leak. United Kingdom Patent Specification No.1,438,237 describes how a rapid escape of fluid from a pipeline causes decompression waves to travel within the pipeline fluid in both directions away from the leak site.These decompression waves, or rarefactions, can be detected by monitoring the dynamic pressure of the fluid.Furthermore, the Specification describes how the leak position can be located by measuring the difference in time of arrival of the decompression wave at detectors installed on either side of the leak. We have now found that the position of a leak in a pipeline can be determined by a method which may be used either as an alternative to or complementarily to earlier known methods. According to the present invention a method of determining the existence and location of a distantly occurring leak of fluid from a pipeline or pressure vessel carrying fluid under pressure comprises measuring the amplitude of the rarefactions propagated through the fluid by the leak at at least two monitoring points, at least one point being upstream of the leak and at least one point being downstream of the leak, and calculating the position of the leak using the equationEMI2.1 where Y is the distance of the leak from one of the monitoring points S is the distance between two monitoring points, one on each side of the leak drips the amplitude ratio of the rarefactions received by the two monitoring points and a is the exponential attenuation factor with distance for the propagation of the rarefaction in the fluid. In its simplest form, the method of the invention is used with only two monitoring points and this will usually be sufficient to determine accurately the location of the leak. However, if desired, additional monitoring points can be employed to provide confirmatory determinations of the leak position. The equation given hereinbefore for determining the leak position is derived as follows. Referring to the accompanying schematic drawing, Fig. 1 a section of a pressure vessel 1 is shown. At intervals along the length of the pressure vessel are positioned monitoring stations D1, D2, D3 Dn Suppose a leak occurs from the pressure vessel 1 at the point marked L. Let the distance from the leak to the two monitoring stations D1 and D2 be X and Y respectively and let the distance between D1 and D2 be S. The rarefaction is attenuated exponentially with distance. Thus the attenuation between the leak and station Dl is exp aX. Similarly the attenuation between the leak and station D2 is exp XY, where a is the exponential attenuation factor. The exponential attenuation factor, a, varies for different fluids and different pipeline characteristics but the factor is readily determinable for any given fluid and pipeline by simulation of a leak in the pipeline, as hereinafter described. The amplitude ratio,of of the two rarefactions received at D1, D2 is given byEMI3.1 vw t exp a X Y 2 Taking logarithms to base e In ln a x Y or a 3 Also, S X Y is the distance between D1 and D2 4 Adding 3 and 4 ln t S 2Y aThe only unknown is Y, the distance from the leak to station D2, which can therefore be calculated. The amplitude of the rarefactions may be measured using any known suitable apparatus but theApplicants have found apparatus of the type described inUK Patents Nos. 1,374,797 and 1,438,237 to be particularly suitable. Experiments to test the feasibility of the method of this invention were carried out in a spur line of an ethylene pipeline. The escape of ethylene. through a leak in the pipeline was simulated by rapidly opening a valve in the 6 spur line for a few seconds. A transient pressure wave leak detector was located some 10 miles from the leak. The detector was a micro computer based system.in which the sensors are piezoelectric transducers which monitor the dynamic pressure of the ethylene. The pressure pulse created by the leak travelled along the pipeline at the velocity of souild in ethylene and arrived at the detector after about i minute. The pulse then travelled onto the end of the spur line about a further mile distant and was reflected back to the detector. It was detected and then travelled back to the leak source which was close to the other end of the spur.The pulse was again reflected and travelled back to the receiver. Thus the detector received a series of the signals from the same leak, allowing the attenuation to be measured. Knowing the attenuation the position of any subsequent leak can be determined. In normal practice, of course, the pulse would continue along the pipe line and two monitoring stations located either side of the leak would be used . It was found that the pressure pulse peak amplitude was linearly proportional to the leak area and, over the range measured, to line pressure. The average attenuation of the pressure pulse with distance was found, in this instance, to be 0.65 0.05 dB mile. The effect of opening and closing the valve in the spur line to simulate the leak is illustrated inFigure 2 which is a plot of the dynamic pressure in the line with time. The method of the present invention provides a novel way of determining accurately the position of the leak. The method can be used on its own or in conjunction with other methods, thereby providing confirmatory results. This is a particularly important consideration in dealing with leaks in difficultly accessible locations, for example underground or undersea pipelines, where considerable expense is involved in reaching the leak. Accurate information on the leak position is essential to avoid unnecessary expense.
