# Switches for radiopagers.

## Abstract
An interlock arrangement for two slide switches for a radio pager ensures that incorrect switch operation does not occur. The casing has two switches A and B with respective switch members 15, 16 inside the casing. Switch member A has a cam follower 15b on an arm which can co operate with one or other of two indents 13, 14 and switch B has a chamfered end 16a . The chamfer and the cam follower are so shaped that when A is in position 1, the other switch member locks A, while if A is operated first attempted movement of B locks A in its new position.
