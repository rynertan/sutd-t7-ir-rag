## Description
This invention relates to a key copying machine, with which a rotating cutter operated by an electric motor cats into a blank key a profile which is equal to that of a sample key and which is aensed by a feeler, said keys being locked on to a support. The keys may be coaxially locked on the support With such copying machines, the support is moved manually so that the feeler follows the profile of the key to be copied, while the cutter reproduces this profile on the blank key. In known machines, there is the disadvantage that at the moment of impact between the cutter and the blank key, the feeler has not yet become properly engaged between the teeth of the sample key, so that the cutter tends to move laterally. In addition the cut key comprises sharp edges in the zone between the profiled teeth, and these act on the revolving plugs of the lock. This is responsible for the well known difficulty to which cut keys are subject, namely of making lock opening difficult because these sharp edges tend to jam during key rotation0 It should be noted that the above mentioned undesired sharp edges may be present both on lateral surfaces delimiting the key notches and also on the bottom surface of the key notches. Different attempts have been already made to remove the drawbacks regarding the above mentioned sharp edges on the bottom surface of the key notches by providing means which allow an adequate relative movement between the cutter and the key to be copied to be performed. Such relative movement is normally a composite movement comprising translatory movement components along different axes perpendicular to each other and rotatory movements about different axes differently positioned to each other. Such relative movements allow also to obtain selectively shaped bottom surfaces of the key notches. It has heretofore been believed that it is techni cally more advantageous if such composite movements are performed manly by the support for the keys while maintaining the cutter unit and the feeler stationary positioned since both the construction and th d operation was believed to be simplier and more efficient in this way. Attempts have also been made to select for the feeler a circular shape corresponding to the circular shape of the cutter to facilitate removal of the sharp edges on the bottom surfaces of the key notches, and to facilitate the relative movement between the circular feeler edge and the notch surface of the sample key. In order to remove the drawback regarding the sharp edges on the lateral surfaces of the key notches especially for those types of keys in which the notches or grooves have parallel side surfaces so that the width of the slot remains constant, attempts have also been made to use circular feelers having zones with different thicknesses so that for each groove width of the key a suitable thickness zone of tie feeler may be selected. However, while this type of feeler is only suitable for the keys with rectangular notches or teeth, the problem of the initial posi tioning is not obviated thereby, since at the instant at which the cutter begins to cut, the feeler did not yet penetrate sufficiently in the notch so that possible drift effects are not prevented.To obviate this, attempts have also been made to render the feeler expandable through spring action and guided from an expanded position projecting forwardly with respect to the cutter to a retracted position in which the feeler is aligned with respect to the cutter, so that the feeler engages the key notch in the projecting position before the cutter reaches its operative position and is then urged in its retracted position against spring action to allow action of the cutter when the circular feeler attains its retracted position, thereby guiding the movement of the cutter into its operstive position.This solution has however the drawback that the resilient and slidable guiding of the feeler cannot guaranty such high precision quality of key reproduction as is frequently required in indus trial key reproduction techniques, in addition to the fact that the resilient feeler support is subject to high local stresses owing to small guiding surface areas, which entails wear, undesirable play thereof, and an insufficiently firm holding thereof, especially in the expanded position of the feeler in which the positioning is most important.In addition, when the feeler has to be shifted from one notch into the other of the sample key, it is necessary to remove the feeler from the notch over a distance which is greater than the sum of the depth of the notch and the spring biased excursion stroke of the feeler, which renders the hand operation of the machine more difficult and easily deceives the operator, who may attempt to shift the cutter unit sidewards, while the expandable feeler is still within the key notch, thereby deformation of the feeler may easily occur especially when a small thickness of the feeler has been selected. The object of the invention is to obviate all above mentioned shortcomings. During his inventive activity the Applicant has found that the believe is wrong, according to which the composite relative movements between the cutter unit and the key support ahould mainly be conferred to key support by allowing such support to perform all the composite rotatory and translatory movements and maintaining stationary the feeler and the cutter unitso It has been in fact found that by selecting appropriate structural features the operability and performance of the machine is improved if both the translatory and angular movements are conferred to the cutter and feeler assembly. The key copying machine according to the invention, which includes an electric motor operated cutter unit with a supporting frame therefor, an adjustable feeler assembly, and a support facing said cutter unit and said feeler assembly and having means for clamping thereon the key to be copied and the sample key and wherein means are provided allowing relative movement between said support and said cutter unit and feeler assembly and wherein the feeler of said feeler assembly senses the shape of said sample key and defines thereby the copying action of the cutter, is characterized in that said feeler assembly has supporting means allowing at least an angular movement of the feeler assembly independent within limits from the cutter unit and its supporting frame. Other features of the machine according to this invention are outlined in the claims 2 through 8 attached to this specification. Ibe characteristics of the present invention will be more apparent from the detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the key copying machine, illustrated by way of example in the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a front view of the machine according to the invention Figure 2 is a partly sectional side view thereof Figure 3 is a plan view thereof Figure 4 is an elevation thereof taken in longitudinal section on the line IV IV of Figure 3. These figures show the quadrangular base 1 of the machine. An upright 3 is fixed by screw means 2 in a central position of the front or operating side of the base, and comprises at its upper end a sleeve 4 Figure 1 which rotatably supports a through pin 5 Figure 2 with its axis horizontal and parallel to the front side of the base and to the axis of rotation of the cutter 28. A support 6 for a blank key 7 Figure 3 and key to be copied 8 is hinged on the pin 5. The support 6 is formed from a pair of brackets 9a, 9b orthogonal to the pin 5 and joined together by a bridge 10.At one end, the brackets comprise respective bush formations 11, for mounting on the portions of the pin 5 which project from the sleeve 4 The support 6 is fixed on the pin5 by means of a screw 52 the tip of which engages in an annular groove 5 . provided in the pin 5 thereby preventing lateral movements of the support 6i Respective aligned grooves 12 parallel to the axis of the pin 5 are provided at the free ends of the brackets 9a, 9b for supporting the shank of the keys 7, 8. The keys are locked on to the brackets 9a, 9b of the slpport 6 by respective clamps 13 constituted by rocker levers pivoted, with their atis parallel to the axis of the pin 5, on pins 14 mounted between lugs 15 of the brackets.The clamps 13 act on the keys by way of locking screws 16, the point of which acts against the respective bracket 9a 9b. A grip 17 for manually rotating the support 6 is longitudinally fixed to the bracket 9a at the corresponding bush 11. In the. rest position, the support 6 rests substantially horizontally by the abutment of the flat bottom surface portion 9 of the bracket 9a against the horizontal surface of an enlarged portion 18 of the up right 3 Figure 1 . The bottom surface of the bracket 9a has an inclined portion 9 , which abuts against portion 18 when the support 6 is upwardly rotated. A pair of projections 19a, 19b extend upwards from the base 1, and comprise coaxial seats for slidably supporting a horizontal shaft 20 parallel to the pin 5.A frame 21 is swivel mounted on the shaft 20, and is constituted by a plate provide a with a pair of right angled arms 22a, 22b which at their free end comprise respective buskrea 23a, 23b Figure 4 for hinging the frame 21 on the shaft 20. On the rear of the swivel frame 21 there is mounted an electric motor 24 for driving, by means of a belt drive 25, a shaft 26 rotaS ably supported by revolving bearings in a sleeve 27 which proÅaects forward from the swivel frame 21. A circular cutter 28 is keyed on to the shaft 26, and is of the type known in the key copying machine field. The cutter 28 is covered upperly for safety reasons by a casing 29 fixed to the frame 21.A lever 30 is fixed to the top of the frame for manually moving, i.e.rotating the frame forward and backward, An arm 31 is mounted, by way of its hub 31a and a spacer 32, on the shaft 20 between the bushes 23a, 23b of the frame 21. A pin 32a radially traverses the spacer 32 and shaft 20, so that the frame 21 and arm 31 are rotatable on the shaft 20, but are locked axially on it. The arm 31 is normally disposed approximately vertically, and is provided at its upper end with a third lever 33 for manually rotating it.A stop 34 Figure 3 projects transversely from the arm 31 towards the rear in proximity to its top, for abutment against the head of a bolt 35 screwed into the frame 21 see also Figure 1 . For the purpose appro priate abutment surfaces are provided on the bolt head 35 and on the stop head 34. In order to prevent the bolt 35 from rotating, a spring 35is disposed between the frame 21 and a shoulder 35b formed from a nnt and locking nut screwed on to the bolt 35. The head of the bolt is provided with radial bores to allow a suitable tool to be inserted, in order to adjust the point of abutment of the stop 34. To the side of the arm 31 there is fixed a composite feeler comprising a lower portion 36 of regular polygonal profile e.g. hexagonal, Figure 2 and an upper portion 37 of circular profile. The portions 36 and 37 lie in the same plane normal to the shaft 20, and the portion 37 is cotintershaped or cut out to receive part of the lower portion so that the front edge of the portions 36, 37 has no interruptions Figure 2 . The sides or segments of the lower portion 36 are of different thicknesses corresponding to those of the cutters and the spaces between the teeth i.e.widths of the notches of conventional keys. In addition, the radius of curvature of the portion 37 is equal to that of the cutter 28, and the position of abutment of the stop 34 on the bolt 35 is adjusted such that the centre of the portion 37 is on the axis of the cutter 28. In such case the periphery of the circular feeler 37 and the cutter 28 lie both on a cylindrical surface the axis of which is parallel to the axis 5 of the support 6, so that the distance between the cutter and the key to be worked ie equal to the distance between the feeler portion 37 and the sample key provided that such keys are correctly clamped on the support 6.If the keys are clamped in an offset position to each other, the cutter and the feeler portion 37. may be likewise offset to each other in order to obtain the above mentioned condition of distances, it being sufficient to adjust for the purpose the position of the bolt 35. The bush 23b is of fork configuration for rotatably mounting on the shaft 20 an arm 38 carrying a roller 39 which roUs on a surface of the base.Between the arm 38 and frame 21 there is a spring 40 which provides a resilient support for the frame 21 when this is inclined backwards in its rest position0 The frame is moved axially by a lever 41 provided with a grip 42 for manual operation and hinged on the projection 19a by means of an articulated joint 43 which enables the lever 41 to rotate both in a hori zontal and a vertical plane. One end of a tie rod 44 is pivoted to the lever 41, its other end being pivoted above the right angled arm 22a of the frame 21. The hinges which hinge the tie rod 44 to the arm 22a and lever 41 are of ball type to allow freedom of movement in all directions. The articulation is such as to leave arm 22a unaffected when lever 41 is rotated in a verti cal plane and to entrain frame 21 through arm 22a in the direction of shaft 20 only when lever 41 is rotated in a horizontal plane. The lever 41 is flat so that it acts on a pin 45 which is inserted with its axis vertical, against a spiral spring 46, in a bore 47 provided in the projection 19a on the base. The pin 45 emerges from the bore 47 by means of its upper end, which is provided with a roller 48 by which it rests on the lower face of the lever 41. The bore 47 partly intersects the seat for the shaft 20, and correspondingly the pin 45 comprises a recessed bevel 49 the depth of which progressively increases from the bottom upwards, and in which the shaft 20 is engaged.A pin 50 screwed into the lever 41 and abutting against the projection 19a acts as a limit stop for the downward movement of the lever 410 The maximum depth of the bevelled recess 49 is so selected at its top, that in the maximum lowered position of the pin 45 there is no engagement with the shaft 20. The machine is provided at its front end with a panel on which tnu switches and controls for the machine motors are disposed. The operation of the described machine is as follows. The blank key 7 and the key to be copied 8 are positioned and locked on the brackets 9a, 9b respectively of the support 6, by operating the locking screws 16 so as to tighten the lever clamps 13. The swivel frame 21 held in its upwardly tilted position, Zi.e. rested upon the spring 40 is then laterally positioned by operating the lever 41 until the cutter 28 is in front of the blank key 7, and the feeler 36, 37 correspondingly in front of the key 8 to be copied To do this, the lever 41 and thus the pin 45 must be lowered in order to free the shaft 20, which is otherwise locked by the wedge effect of the bevel 49 under the action of the spring 46.By keeping the lever 41 lowered and moving it in a horizontal planet the swivel frame 21 can be moved laterally. It can then be exactly positioned by operating also the lever 33 of the arm 31 which during such operation is also rotated so as to move the lower feeler 36 between the teeth of the key to be copied thereby disengaging the stop 34 from the bolt 35, while the support 6 is maintained in its horizontal rest position with the surfaces 18 and 9 abutting against each other0 At this point, the lever 41 is released to again lock the longitudinal or lateral position of the swivel frame 21. By then operating the cutter 28, the key 7 can be cut by rotating the entire swivel frame 21 on the shaft 20 by means of the lever 30, until contact is obtained between the cutter and key0 This rotation, iOe. the depth of the cut, is controlled by the feelers 36, 37 supported on the arm 31 when the engagement of the frame bolt 35 with the stop 34 occurs again through the forward tilting of the frame 21. t The support 6 is rotated about the axis of the pin 5 by operating the grip 17, with contact between the cutter 28 and key 7 and between the feeler and key 8 always being maintained by the lever 30. In particular, by rotating the support 6 the portion 37 is brought into contact with the key 8 to be copied, so that the cutter 28 cuts a suitably rounded profile in the blank key 7. Of fundamental importance in the described machine is the arrangement of the arm 31, which enables the cutter 28 to be brought into perfect aligment on the blank key without this operation being compromised, as in conventional copying machines, by the impact of the cutter with the key, which often causes the tool to move laterally, so damaing the tooth profile, and the key pattern. This danger is completely overcome.in the described copier, in that after the portion 36 hasPenetrated between the teeth of the sample key, the shaft 20 is axially locked by the pin 45, so that the cutter can approach the blank while remaining in the same plane. The lower portion 36 of the feeler can be easily rotated in order to change the thickness of the side which is to come into contact with the sample key according to the space between the key teeth. This thickness and that of the cutter are equal. It will be appreciated that the bolt 35a can be always adjusted so that the distance of the edge of the feeler 36 or 37 to be operated from the key to be copied is equal to the distance of the cutter edge from the key blank to be cut, so that the cutter follows exactly the path of the feeler defined by the shape of the key teeth to be copied. As above stated the thickness of the circular feeler 37 corresponds always to that of the minimum thickness segment of the polygonal feeler 36.In this connection note should be taken that even if it happens that the spaces between the key teeth are greater than the thickness of the circular feeler, this does not jeopardize the operation when the circular feeler is in action, since the frame 21 is prevented to move laterally by the upwardly urged pin 45 acting on shaft 20 so that in such case the circular feeler 37 serves only to determine the depth of the notch to be cut. The operator can thus select according to the circumstances to use e.g. the polygonal feeler 36 only for the beginning stage of the cut and to put in action immediately afterwards the circular feeler 37 by appropriate rotation of the support 6 and swivel frame 21. It will be understood that, when the frame 21 is prevented from lateral movements only rectangular teeth can be cut into the blank. If inclined teeth should be cut by the same machine it is possible either to press permanently downwards the blocking pin 45 by a catch acting thereon and not shown, so that when the beginning stage of the cutting operation has been effected the blocking pin 45 is unblocked by pressing it downwardly and maintaining it in depressed condition by the above mentioned catch so that the swivel frame may be laterally moved during the cutting operation by acting appropriately on the lever 30 and lever 17 to cut inclined teeth, or alternatively the support 6 may be replaced by another support which allows lateral movements so that the operation may be carried out while maintaining the swivel frame 21 laterally blocked. It will be appreciated that the adjusting bolt 35 allows adjustment within a wide range and with great precision. This is very important, since the operator is not always in a position to fix in exact alignment the position of the key to be copied and the key blank so that the distance between the blank and the cutter and the key to be copied and the feeler is not the same. A fine adjustment can then be carried out by means of the adjustment bolt 35. In this way high precision key copying may be rapidly obtained on an industrial scales According to a further characteristic of the present invention, the support 6 can be rapidly replaced by another, simply by removing the screw 52 and with drawing the pin 5. The new support can be fitted with clamps for fixing keys of another type, such as Chubb keys. Grooves can be made by a further tool 53 keyed on to the shaft 26, and also able to carry out various finishing operations.
