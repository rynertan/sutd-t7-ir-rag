# Dental compositions, fired dental porcelains and processes for making and using same.

## Abstract
A composition for making a fired dental porcelain is disclosed which composition comprises a powder dental porcelain frit material and a second material. The second material is selectively etchable from a fired dental porcelain prepared from the composition and the second material can, upon such firing of the composition, maintain a separate phase so that, when the composition is formed into a fired dental porcelain having a dental porcelain surface to be bonded to a dental substrate and the dental porcelain surface is etched to remove second material therefrom, the porosity and surface area of the dental porcelain surface will be increased to provide enhanced bonding to the dental porcelain surface the dental substrate. Also disclosed are fired dental porcelains prepared therefrom and methods of making and using same.
