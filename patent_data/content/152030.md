## Description
ADULT T CELL LEUKEMIA VIRUS ANTIGEN POLYPEPTIDE The present invention relates to an adult T cell leukemia virus antigen polypeptide encoded by env gene, a recombinant plasmid.wherein a DNA fragment coding for the peptide is incorporated, a microqranism containing the plasmid, and a process for producing the adult T cell leukemia virus antigen polypeptide encoded by the env gene using the microorganism. Adult T cell leukemia virus hereinafter referred to as ATLV , which is a synonym of human T cell leukemia virus HTLV , is a C type retrovirus isolated from patients with adult T cell leukemia hereinafter referred to as ATL Yoshida et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 79, 2031 2036 1982 1. There are numerous reports that ATL patients have a poor prognosis and that efficacious treatment does not exist leading to a 50 mortality rate within 10 months. In recent years, an antibody which reacts specifically with cultured MT 1 cells derived from ATL has been shown to exist in the serum of ATL patients Hinuma et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 78, 6476 6480 1981 . The existence of this antibody has been confirmed subsequently in most ATL patients and the corresponding antigens are called ATL associated antigen hereinafter referred to as ATLA . It has been found that the antibody specific for ATLA hereinafter referred to as Anti ATLA antibody exists ,in 25 of normal, healthy adults in areas with a high incidence of ATL. It has also been shown that the distribution of cases possessing the anti ATLA antibody corresponds to the regions with high ATL incidence. Furthermore, it has been shown that ATLA is mainly the antigen of this retrovirus. The existence of ATLV genome in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients has been established. ATLV has also been detected by culturing the lymphocytes of normal people who are positive to anti ATLA antibody. There is a very close correlation between ATL andATLV, and ATLV is considered to be the causative virus ofATL. Though the route by which infection occurs is still unknown, it has been proved that transfusion of blood is one of the routes. As 25 of healthy people in areas with a high incidence of ATL are anti ATLA antibody positive, the likelihoodthatthey are carriers of ATLV is extremely high, which means that they must be avoided as blood donors for transfusion. Therefore, detection of the presence of anti ATLA antibody will enable avoidance of transfusion from the carriers and early ATL detection. At the present time, detection of anti ATLA antibody is conducted using acetone fixed slides of cultured cells derived from ATL. However, a simpler, faster method of anti ATLA antibody detectionand earlier ATL diagnosis are desirable. The present inventors have studied about a method for providing one of the ATLA which is useful for detection of anti ATLA antibody and prevention of ATLV infection in a large amount and at low cost. As the result, it has now been found that an ATLV antigen polypeptide encoded by the env gene of ATLV genome can be accumulated in a large amount by culturing a yeast containing a recombinant DNA which is obtained by incorporating the env gene into a vector DNA using recombinant DNA techniques. It has already been reported that one of the products derived from the env gene is a glycosylated protein gp 62 having a molecular weight of 62,000 Hattori et a1. Gann, 74, 790 793 1983 and the entire DNA sequence of ATLV was determined by the present inventors JapanesePatent Application No. 214287 82, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.,USA, 80, 3618 3622 1983 . The present invention provides a recombinant plasmid wherein a DNA fragment containing the env gene ofATLV is incorporated, a microorganism containing the plasmid, and a process for producing an ATLV antigen peptide product derived from the env gene using the microorganism.The production of ATLV antigen polypeptide encoded by the env gene using a microorganism was achieved first by the present invention. The. ATLV surface antigen protein produced by the present invention contains the entire protein of the surface antigen and so all the antigenic determinants present plurally on the surface antigen. Therefore, it is considered to be useful as an antigen for diagnosis and vaccination. Fig. l is a flow sheet showing the construction of plasmid pATYE307. In the drawing, H refers to HaeIII site, the arrow refers to the transcription direction of P Ã³O and the arrow refers to the transcription direction of the env gene. The present invention provides a recombinant plasmid wherein a DNA fragment containing the env gene ofATLV is incorporated, a microorganism containing the plasmid, and a process for producing an ATLV antigen peptide product derived from the env gene using the microorganism. The construction of the recombinant plasmid of the present invention is carried out in the following manner. The recombinant plasmid can be constructed by incorporating a DNA coding for the env gene of ATLV into a vector DNA using recombinant DNA techniques. As the DNA coding for the env gene of ATLV, for example, pATKl0O cloned by Seiki et al. Seiki et al.,Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 80, 3613 3622 1983 can be used. The genome of ATLV consists of the LTR at both ends and of at least four genes, namely, qaa, pol, env and pX.Since the protein encoded by the env gene is known to be a surface antigen expressed by the infection of ATLV, it is expected that the protein is useful for the diagnosis of AmLV infections, prevention of ATLV infections and treatment of leukemia caused by ATLV. It is also possible to use the protein itself as a vaccine. pATK100 is a clone containing the entire env gene and can be used as a source of the DNA fragment containing t env gene. Any vector DNA can be utilized, provided that the inserted desired DNA can be expressed in a microorganism. A plsld which has an appropriate promoter such as those derived from 3 phosphoglycerte kinase PGK , tryptophan ml J, alcohol dehydrogenase I ADHI , galactose kinase Ci , t glycerolaldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH and p 60 of yeast and in which a desired DNA can be inserted downstream from the promoter is preferably used. As the plasmid, pYeHBs, pMA36, pMA56, pAM82 and the ike are employable. It is preferable to use pAM82, which can be prepared by the method described in Miyanohara et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. t USA, 80, 1 5 1983 . pAM82 is a plasmid which has the replication initiation site and ampicillin resistance ApR gene derived from pBR322, the arsl gene and leu2 gene derived from yeast and the replication initiation site of 2 DNA and which is capable of replicating autonomously in Escherichia coli and yeast and of being identified in the plasmid carrying strain. Further, put82 has the promoter region of the polypeptide P 60 gene of repressible acid phosphatase derived from yeast, and therefore, a foreign DNA can be expressed by inserting a genehaving a translation initiation site into the plasmid at the unique XhoI site. Recombination of a DNA containing the env gene ofATLV, for example, a DNA from pATK100 and a vector DNA, for example, pAM82 can be carried out using general recombinantDNA techniques in which both DNAs are digested with restriction enzymes followed by ligation using T4 DNA ligase. Ligation may be conducted by a method employing fill in reaction with DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment or a method using a DNA linker. In the case of pATRl00 and pAM82 mentioned as examples, as shown in Fig. 1, recombinant plasmid pATYE307 can be constructed by digesting the env gene of pATK100 with restri ction enzyme PstI, changing the ends to blunt ends with T4 DNA polymerase and inserting the DNA fragment obtained by a further digestion with HindIII and HaeIII into an XhoI site of pAM82. Tte reaction conditions necessary for the abovedescribed preparation of the recombinant plasmid are generally as follows.
