DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figures 1 and 4 are perspective views and Figure 9 is a front view of alternative suture packages of this invention Figures 2, 5 and 1Q are front views of theFigures 1, 4 and 9, respectively Figures 3 and 6 are perspective views and Figure 12 is a front view showing the folding sequence of the suture packages of Figures 2, 5 and 10, respectively Figure 7 is a perspective view, and Figures 13 to 15 are front views showing the folding sequence of folders useful with the suture packages of Figures 4 and 9, respectively Figure 8 is a perspective view showing the suture package of Figure 4 being loaded into the folder of Figure 7 and Figure 11 is a perspective view showing the suture package of Figure 9 being removed from the folder of Figures 13 to 15. The essence of this invention, described in conjunction with the attached drawings, comprises a folded paper holder for a double or single armed ophthalmic suture.The holders for absorbable and nonabsorbable sutures are slightly different and are described separately below. Figure 1 describes the preferred nonabsorbable suture package. The package can be contained in an exterior sealed envelope, for example as described in US 4,089,410Figure 1 which is incorporated by reference. Preferably, the exterior envelope is composed of a gas pervious, bacteria impervious spun bonded backing and transparent facing.Within this envelope is a suture holder, preferably composed of foldable 90 pound sterile offset paper. A label showing product information such as the type, size, and or length of the suture and or of the needles, and the manufacturer can be affixed to an exterior suture holder flap, for example flap lc. Figure 2 describes the suture holder after it has been removed from the envelope and opened along score lines 3, 4 and 5 to show construction and suture configuration. Although double score lines are described, it is to be understood that single score lines are also within the scope of this invention. The needles 6 are held in place by insertion into a first foam receptacle 7. Preferably, the first receptacle 7 is. manufactured from a commercially available polyolefin foam, such as polyethylene or polypropylene. A double backed adhesive can be used to affix the foam receptacle to the suture holder. The suture 8 is coiled on the center panel 1 of the suture holder. Preferably, the coil is in a helical or figure eight configuration. Generally, either coil configurations can be used. Also, other coil configurations, e.g. sinusoidal, may be used provided they allow dispensing of the suture or one half of the suture from the holder without tangling. After coiling, a loop is formed in about the midpoint of the suture. The loop is held in place by insertion into a second foam receptacle 9. The second receptacle 9 contains a slit 9a to contain the loop. Optionally, the suture loop may be directed back to foam receptacle 7 and held in place by insertion into a slit within receptacle 7. The suture holder of this invention is direct dispensing. That is, the suture holder does not have to be unfolded during use. After removing the suture holder from the exterior envelope, the user dispenses the suture by disengaging the needles from the first receptacle and then pulling them until the suture is removed from the holder. If only one half of the suture is required, the loop is severed prior to dispensing. A term such as CUT and or a symbol can be printed on the suture holder or label in a visible location proximal to the suture loop.The user dispenses about one half of the suture by disengaging one of the needles from the first receptacle and then pulling on it until about one half of the suture is removed from the holder. Figure 3 describes the folding sequence of the suture holder of Figure 2. Flap la is placed onto center panel 1. Slit 2 on center panel 1 is used to contain a distal corner of flap la. Flap lb is then placed onto flap la. Flap lb aids in confining the suture in the suture holder during loading and or transporting. Flap lb contains an opening to allow the loop to be visible and to be severed without unfolding the flap. Flap lc is then placed onto flap lb and partially onto flap la. Slit 16 on flap la is used to contain a distal edge of flap lc. Referring to Figure 3, when a distal edge of flaps la and lc are adjacent to the score line s 5, a recess in the edge of both flaps is necessary to allow the suture loop to be visible and to be severed without unfolding the flaps. Although a recess in the edge of both flaps is described, it is to be understood that alternative means of allowing the suture loop to be visible and to be severed without unfolding the flap is within the scope of this invention. For example, a distal edge of flaps la and lc can be adjacent to the second foam receptacle 9. Figure 4 describes the preferred absorbable suture package. The package can be contained in an interior and then in an exterior sealed envelope. An adequate interior and exterior envelope useful with the package. of this. invention is. described in the prior art. Referring to Figure 4, the absorbable suture package contains a folder 10 and a suture holder 11. The folder 10 wraps around the suture holder to provide tear resistance to the suture holder. The folder 10 contains a recess to allow the needles 16 to be dispensed and to allow the suture loop to be visible and to be severed. Figure 5 describes the suture holder after it has been removed from the exterior and interior envelopes, and from the folder 10, and opened along score lines 12, 13 and 14 to show construction and suture configuration. Although double score lines are described, it is to be understood that single score lines are also within the scope of this insertion. The needles 16 are held in place by insertion into the receptacle 15. Preferably, the receptacle is manufactured from a commercially available polypropylene foam. A double backed adhesive can be used to affix the receptacle to the suture holder. The suture 8 is coiled on the center panel 17 of the suture holder. Preferably, the coil is in a helical or figure eight configuration. Generally, either coil configuration can be used. Also, other coil configurations, e.g. sinusoidal, may be used provided they allow dispensing of the suture or one half of the suture from the holder without tangling. After coiling, a loop is formed in about the midpoint of the receptacle 15. The receptacle contains a slit 15a to contain the loop. The suture holder of this invention is direct dispensing. That is, the suture holder does not have to be unfolded nor does it have to be removed from the interior envelope and the folder during use. The absorbable suture holder is used by the user pulling open the exterior envelope. The interior envelope is then projected onto a sterile field. The interior envelope is then opened by a diagonal tear, exposing the receptacle 15. The user dispenses the suture by disengaging the needles from the receptacle and then pulling them until the suture is removed from the holder. If only one half of the suture is required, the loop is severed prior to dispensing. A term such as CUT and or a symbol can be printed on the suture holder in a visible location proximal to the suture loop.The user dispenses one half of the suture by disengaging one of the needles from the receptacle and then pulling on it until about one half of the suture is removed from the holder. Figures 6 and 7 describe the folding sequence of the suture holder of Figure 5 and of the folder, respectively. Referring to Figure 6, flap 17a is placed onto center panel 17. Slit 18 on center panel 17 is used to contain a distal corner of flap 17a. Flap 17b aids in containing the suture in the suture holder during loading and or transporting. Flap 17c is then placed onto flap 17b and partially onto flap 17a. Slit 18 on flap 17a is used to contain a distal edge of flap 17c. Referring to Figure 7, flap 10a is folded such that it is contiguous with center panel 17. Flap 10b is then placed onto flap 10a. Slit l9a on flap 10a is used to contain tab 20 on flap 10b. Figure 8 describes a method of loading the suture holder 11 into the folder 10. The folder is folded as described in conjunction with Figure 7 above. The suture holder is then slid into the folder such that the folder recess is adjacent to the needles and the loop. It is to be understood that alternative loading methods are within the scope of this invention. For example, the center panel of the holder 10 can be placed onto flap 17c.The holder 10 can then be folded as described in conjunction with Figure 7 above. Figure 9 describes the preferred absorbable suture package for microsurgical use. The package can be contained in an interior and then in an exterior sealed envelope, which are known from the prior art. Referring to Figure 9, the absorbable suture package contains a folder 10 and a suture holder 11. The folder 10 wraps around the suture holder to provide tear resistance to the suture holder. The height of the holder 11 is greater than the height of the front portion of the folder 10 to allow the needle 16 to be dispensed. Referring to Figures 9 to12, an optional embodiment is the word PULL and or an arrow affixed to the upper portion of the holder 11 to indicate the direction for dispensing it from the folder 10. Another optional embodiment is a dot adjacent the butt end of the needle 16 to assist the user in locating the needle in the receptacle 15. Fianlly, the preferred receptacle 15 is shown in partial view. The needle 16 is therefore shown as being visible. It is to be understood however that the needle 16 is placed into and not on the receptacle 15. Figure lOdescribes the suture holder after it has been removed from the exterior and interior envelopes, the folder 10, and then opened along score lines 12, 13 and 14 to show construction and suture configuration. It is to be understood that single or double score lines separating the respective holder panels are within the scope of this invention. The needle 16 is held in place by insertion into the receptacle 15. Preferably, the receptacle is manufactured from a commercially available polypropylene foam. A double backed adhesive can be used to affix the receptacle 15 to the suture holder 11. The suture 8 is loaded onto the center panel í 7. Any loading configuration my be used provided Lhe dispensing of the suture from the holder is without tangling. The suture package of this invention can be direct dispensing. That is, the suture holder does not have to be unfolded or removed from the interior envelope or from the folder 10 during use. Preferably, however, the suture holder 11 is removed from the folder 10. The absorbable suture holder 11 can be used by pulling open the exterior envelope. The interior envelope is then projected onto a sterile field. The interior envelope is then opened by a diagonal tear, exposing the needle 16 in the receptacle 15. The user can then dispense the suture 8 by disengaging the needle 16 from the receptacle i5 and then pulling it until the suture is removed from the package. Alternatively, referring to Figurell, the holder 1l can be removed from the folder 10. The user can then dispense the suture 8 from the holder 11 as described above A grid on the exterior surface of the panel 17c can be used, for example, to orient and or to measure the suture 8. A marking, for example mm , can be used to show the actual distance between w parallel lines of said grid. Figure 12 describes the folding sequence of the holder of Figure 10. Specifically, flap 17a is folded on score line 13 and placed onto center panel 17. Flap 17b is folded onto flap 17a. Flap 17b aids in containing the suture in the suture holder during loading andior transporting. Flap lic is then placed onto flap 17b and partially onto flap i7a. Slit l8a on flap 17a is used to contain an edge portion of flap 17c. Figure 13 describes the folder after it has been removed from the exterior and interior envelopes and opened. It is to be understood that single or double score lines separating the respective folder panels can be within the scope of this invention. Figures 14 and 15 describe the folding sequence of the suture folder ofFigure 13. Referring to Figures 14 and 15, flap 1 is folded onto flap 2. Flap 1 is then folded onto the center panel 3. Flap 4 is folded onto flap 2. Flap 6 is then folded onto flap 5. Flap 6 is then folded onto flap 4 and partially onto flap 3. Figure 11 describes a method of loading the suture holder 11 into the folder 10. As described above,Figure 11 also describes a method of removing the folder 10 from the holder 11. An alternative method of loading the holder 11 into the folder 10 is described in conjunction with Figures and 15 The suture holder 11 can be placed in the pocket of the partially formed folder 10 between flaps 1 and 2.In this alternative method of loading,center panel 17 can be placed onto flap I of the folder 10. The folder 10 can then be completely assembled as described in Figures 14 and 15.
