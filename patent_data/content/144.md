# Process for preparing 2 isocyanatoalkyl esters of unsaturated carboxylic acids.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to a process for preparing a 2 isocyanatoalkyl ester of an unsaturated carboxylic acid by reacting a water soluble 2 alkenyl 2 oxazoline with a solution of phosgene in a water immiscible organic solvent in the presence of an aqueous solution of a hydrochloric acid acceptor. The process is characterized by adding the 2 alkenyl 2 oxazoline into the reaction mixture as an aqueous soluion. The aqueous solution of the 2 alkenyl 2 oxazoline is prepared by reacting a 2 alkyl 2 oxazoline with formaldehyde to form 2 α hydroxymethylalkyl 2 oxazoline, dehydrating the 2 α hydroxymethylalkyl 2 oxazoline to form the 2 alkenyl 2 oxazoline, and separating a voatile composition from the reaction product of the dehydrating step which when condensed, comprises an aqueous solution of the 2 alkenyl 2 oxazoline. The 2 isocyanatoalkyl esters produced by the process of this invention are useful as reactive intermediates in preparing coating formulations from hydroxyl containing compounds that are curable through the carbon to carbon double bond.
