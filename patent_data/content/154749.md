# Solid phase immunoassay with visual readout.

## Abstract
Solid phase assay for an analyte wherein binder is supported on a solid support, such as nitrocellulose, and the tracer is comprised of ligand labeled with a coloured par ticulate label, such as a liposome including a dye. The assay has a high sensitivity, and the tracer is visible on the support under assay conditions, whereby tracer can be determined, without instrumentation, and without further treatment thereof.
