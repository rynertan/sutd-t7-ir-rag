# Electron beam line width measurement system.

## Abstract
Disclosed is an electron beam line width measurement sys tem wherein an electron beam 1 is converged to a fine spot, the electron beam 1 is scanned an a sample 5 formed with a pattern to be measured, secondary electrons 2 generated from a surface of the sample 5 by the projection of the elec tron beam 1 are detected, and the detected signal is processed to determine a line width of the pattern to be measured. A secondary electron detector 3 detects a signal corresponding to the amount of all secondary electrons 2 generated by the scanning, and a secondary electron energy analyzer 4 selec tively detects a signal corresponding to an amount of second ary electrons 2 of specified energy. It thus becomes possible precisely to detect a pattern boundary region defined by differ ent sorts of materials in a stepped structure of a small level diffrence, which has not been measurable with a prior art elec tron beam line width measurement system.
