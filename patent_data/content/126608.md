# Fluidic device.

## Abstract
A fluidic diverter comprising a housing 10 forming a chamber 11 having an inlet 12 at one end and two deverging outlets 13, 14 at the opposite end. An asymmetric configura tion is produced within the chamber by axially spaced steps 18, 19 in opposing walls 15, 16 of the chamber and a single control port 17 communicates with the chamber at a position associated with the step adjacent the inlet. In use and in the absence of a control at the control port, flow will emerge through the outlet 14 at the side of the chamber associated with the control port 17 . A fluidic pumping system includes a fluidic pump having the fluidic diverter in a delivery line of the pump.
