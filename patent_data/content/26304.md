# IMPROVED CONTENT ADDRESSED TEXT SEARCH APPARATUS FOR A TEXT PROCESSING SYSTEM

## Abstract
In a text processing system having a keyboard 8 , a printing mechanism 6 , a text storage 10 and a processing unit 2 , an improved content addressed text search apparatus is provided that locates a reference point in a string of text representative codes in storage 10 based on com parisons with an address string entered by the operator on the keyboard 8 . Such comparisons are automatically modified to equate certain codes and code patterns that present an ambiguity to the operator in establishing the address string, e.g. a tab operation and a series of space operations may have the same apparent result for printing but are stored as differ ent codes. By so expanding the acceptable matching code patterns selectively with respect to the codes presented for comparison, the likelihood of operator success in identifying a desired text location is increased significantly.
