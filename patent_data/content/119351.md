# OFFSET ORBIT FLUFF GENERATOR

## Abstract
Apparatus for converting bales of wood pulp sheets to fluff. There is a non rotating horizontal bed plate having a port through which the cutter tips of a cutting mill project from below. A cylindrical casing is journalled on its lower rim for rotation above said bed plate about a vertical axis that is perpendicular to the bed plate. Sets of guide means are mounted to the interior of the casing. Each guide means set holds a bale such that the bales are prevented from centrifuging radially outwardly but can settle on the bed plate. The guide means are located so they keep all portions of the areas of the bales offset or radially spaced from the casing axis in which case the bales are driven in an orbital path as they are swept over the cutting mill.
