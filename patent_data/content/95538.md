## Description
IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO BEDS This invention relates to hospital beds and trolleys of te kind in which the platform to support the patient is mounteg on a linkace froi a base frame or chassis with a jack for extending the linkage so as to raise the platform. One earls proposal of this kind is contained in our prior Patent 1060120 where the linkage is an X frame and the jack is a hydraulic one. A much rore recent proposal is contained in our applicationNo. 2018221 where a mechanical jack is use to move pairs of radius arrow and tile platforn, base and radius arn s together rake up a kind of parallellogram linkage. In beds of this kind the jack provides for elevation of tie platform and the platform is allowed to descend to a lower position under its own weight.Often a gas strut is used as a damper to restrict the rate of descent. Particularly in the case of the mechanical jack, elaborate provision is ade for transferring the weight of the platform and hence cf the patient from one part of the linkage to the other at the end of a period of elevation, or at the commencement of a period of descent, with the object of avoiding jerkiness and shocks which are transmitted to the patient. The object of the invention is to provide an improved structure. In accordance with the invention, a hospital hed or trolley has a platform carried on a pair of radius arms forming a generally parallellogram linkagc, a tie rod connected between the radius arms , the rod or a ran connected to t1 c radius arms passing through a pair of canting plates of a mechanical jack, an elevating pedal on the end of one limb of a lever which extends generally parallel to said tie rod, a second lirrb of the lever extending transversely of the tie rod and being fixed to a rocking crank, the crank being coupled to an operating member connected to one of said plates whereby pedal displacement cants the plate to wedge on the rod or ram and axially displaces the sane t elevate the platform, and the second of the plates being springloaded to a normal cant inc position in which it wedge locks the rod or ram but allows the same to be drawn therethrough in the platform elevating direction, and a second like pedal for displacing the second plate to the non canting non wedge locking position, characterised in tat there is no connection between the two pedals and in that said second pedal is directly and permanently crank connected to a member for displacement of ttie second plate. Comparing the invention with the structure in said prior application 2018221, it will be seen that considerable simplification is effecteei. A complete rod with its springloading abutments and like are omitted and the comparatively complicated linkages connecting the descent pedal to the second plate are also eliminated teing replaced by tie direct connection. According te a feature cf the invention, the platform is pivotally connected to one of the radius arrow and is connected to the ether of the radius arms by an adjustable length strut whereby the platform may be tilted relative to the base frame known per se and the base frame terminates as clese as possible to the echanism at the foot end of the latter so that aximum tilting of the platform in a foot down position is possible even at minimum elevations of the platform. These and other features of the invention will be Jore clearly understood froi the description of a presently preferred embodiment of the invention which is now given in conjunction with the acconpanying drawings wherein Figure 1 is a elevation of the bed, Figure 2 is a plan view of the sare with the mattress supporting platform removed, and certain parts cut away for clarity Figure 3 is an elevation of the jack structure used in the bed of Figures 1 and 2 and Figure 4 is a plan view of the same, Figures 3 and 4 being on a larder scale than Figures 1 and 2. Turning now to Figure 1, the bed comprises a base frame 10 provided with a castor 12 at each corner and mounting a pair of radius arns 14 16 which are duplicated on opposite sides of the base frame and are journalled on the base frame. The radius arms have crank extensions 18 20 which are coupled by tie rods 22 only one of which is seen in these drawings. This lay be effected by providing parallel shafts 24 26 each of which is coupled to the free ends of the corresponding cranks 18 or 20, these shafts 24 26 being interconnected by a single tie rod 22 which may be laterally offset frol the centre line of the arrangement, as best seen in Figure 2.The tie rod may be connected to a gas strut or damper 28 and the opposite end of the sare is fixer to the front cf the base frame, as also seen in figure 2. The jacl , which is particularly shown in Figures 3 and 4, comprises a ram 30 which is ccnnected to the shaft 24 so that the action of the jac is to swing tile shaft 24 anticlockwise during elevation of the bed platform 32. The platform 32 is connected to te radius arms 14 and 16 by a pair of links 34 towards the foot end of the bed and by a a pair of adjustable links 36 towards the head end of the bed. The former are connected to the radius arms 14 and the latter to the radius ars 16.The adjustment, by extending the effective length of the links 36 tilts the foot end of the platform 32 downwardly or vice versa , and it will be noted particularly fro Figure 2 that the base frame extends forwardly of the radius arms 13 by relatively small d dimension so that maximum foot down tilt can be achieved even when the bed platform is at minimum elevation, and without the platfcrr contacting the base frame in the area indicated hy the arrow A of Figure 1. The radius arms are journalled by diametrically split shell bearings clamped to the base frame by U bolts. Turning now to the jack construction of Figures 2 and 4, this comprises a pair of side plates 40 which are connected together by transversely extending plates 42 46 which also form abutments as will be hereinafter explained. Additionally, the side plates 40 are connected by a carrier member 48 which is used to ount the jack in the base frare. A first canting plate 50 abuts the jack member 42 antl is urged by compression spring 52 trapped between it and the jack body member 44. This plate 50 is the one used to displace the ram 30 in the direction of the arrow B of Figure 3 and elevate the platform.Displacement is effected by tie red 54 which is urged by spring 56 trapped between an abutment on the rod and a loose abutment plate 58, and the rod 54 is connected to crank 50 which is fast with the limb 62 cf ttie first pedal shaft The pedal shaft is generally L shaped with its second limb extending forwardly and approximately parallel to the ra 30, and the shaft is journalled in the plates 40 of the jack body.When the pedal 64 is depressed the crank is rocked anticlockwise, the tie rod 54 is displaced generally in the direction of the arrow fs, te canting plate 50 tilts because it is restrained in its lower end by the spring 52 the plate wedges on the ram 30, and the rod is displaced in the direction of arrow b. hen the pedal is released, the springs s return it and the tie rod 54 and plate 50 to the positions illustrated in Figures 1 and 3 respectively. The ran 30 passes through a second and locking plate 70 which rocks on the abutment 46 and is urged to the illustrated position by spring 72 which is a compression spring abutting against the opposite side of the plate 42 to that abutted by the first plate 50. The spring 72 cants the second plate 70 into the locking position, but movement of the ram 30 in the direction of the arrow B is accompanied by slight movement of the plate against the spring 72 to allow the ram to be drawn through the plate.Any tendency towards reverse movement permits the spring to wedge the plate 70 on the ram and prevent reverse movement of the ram 30. The second pedal 76 is connected to a corresponding pedal shaft likewise journalled and crank connected, but this tie connected to rod 78 which is urged generally in tie direction of arrow I by compression spring 80 trapped between abutment on the rod and the floating abutment 58.The free end of rod 78 carries a striker 82, here shown as an adjustable r er er, which, on depression of pedal 76 is generally axially displaced against th plate 70 to counter cant the same and vercome the spring 72 to allow the ral 30 to Jove in the direction opposite to that of arrow P. It will be appreciated that because there is no interconnection between the rods 54 and 78 movement of either completely independently of the other is possible. This is a particularly simple jack mechanism which is economical to manufacture. evertheless it has been found in experiments that the illustrated construction does not result in any jar to the platform when descent commences despite the absence of complicated rovisicns for transferring load froIn one pedal operated mechanism to the other.
