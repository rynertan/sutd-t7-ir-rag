# Splint for stabilising animal teeth.

## Abstract
The economic value of an animal e.g. a sheep is en hanced by bonding the incisor teeth 2 together in a group, when the teeth are fully matured, but before trauma of the teeth has occurred, with an apertured brace 5 which is bonded to the group of teeth by means of a hardened bonding composition 6 to leave the incisal edges 3 of the group of teeth exposed. The invention also relates to a splint 5 for stabilising animal teeth to reduce the risk of trauma.
