# One part solvent free thermosettable prepolymer composition.

## Abstract
An adhesive and coating composition pertaining to the technical field of polymer chemistry, in a stageable one part solvent free thermosettable formulation, containing a pre polymer terminated with blocked isocyanate groups and hav ing a melting point below 95 C, a difunctional amine or alcohol which is soluble in the prepolymer at 95 C, a mono functional amine or alcohol which is soluble in the pre polymer at 95 C, with at least one of the foregoing bearing fury or furfuryl substituents, and a bis dieneophile. The com position undergoes separate, essentially sequential chain lengthening and crosslinking reactions.
