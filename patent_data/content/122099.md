# Connection of and sealing of tubular members.

## Abstract
An annular collar 14.1 having an internal annular recess 48.1 is connected to a tubular member 12.1 by positioning it over the end of the tubular member which is then deformed radially into the recess 40.1 by the expansion of a synthetic rubber sleeve 58.1 under the effect of internal fluid pressure. The sleeve 58.1 forms part of a connection tool 24.1 com prising a mandrel 34.1 having screw threaded ends 36.1, 38.1 carrying confining rings 42.1 which, in conjunction with anti extrusion members 64.1 , confine the sleeve 58.1 in an axial direction and thus cause its expansion to be radially outwardly. The mandrel 34.1 is held in position by a flange 26.1 bolted to a second flange 16.1 which is welded at 18.1 to the collar 14.1 . The mandrel has an axial bore 78.1 for connection to a source of fluid pressure and which commu nicates with a radial bore 80.1 leading to an internal recess 60.1 in the sleeve 58.1 to produce the required expansion.
