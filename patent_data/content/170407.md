# Agents for the removal of impurities from a molten metal and a process for producing same.

## Abstract
An agent for removing impurities from a molten metal comprising a first compound capable of reacting with and removing the impurities contained in the molten metal and a second substance coated on the first compound to form a composite. The second substance has a contact angle with the molten metal less than that of the first compound, thereby causing the composite to be more wettable in the molten metal as compared to the first compound. This helps the composite to penetrate into the molten metal, resulting in the first compound efficiently reacting with the impurity contained within the molten metal. In one example of the invention, an desulfurising agent for iron and steel compris es calcium carbide having a coating of titania.
