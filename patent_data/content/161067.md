# VOLTAGE FOLLOWER

## Abstract
For a voltage follower unity gain amplifier, used, for in stance, as a buffer in a transceiver associated with a data bus, the input signal is fed forward to a comparator T2 T3 to which the output is also applied. The input is also applied via an amplifier stage T5 T6 to a transistor T4 in the com moned circuit of the comparator, which is a long tailed pair. Thus, with a connection from the output of the circuit which includes another transistor T9 , provides negative feedback round the comparator, gives a highly stable current.
