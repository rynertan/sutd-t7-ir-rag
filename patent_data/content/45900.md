# Methods for the continuous conversion of magnetic values into electrical values.

## Abstract
The magnetization of the core of an inductance dimi nishes its reactance. The magnetization of the core, common to two or more inductive circuits, modifies the characteristics of a local oscillation, the mutual induction and the transfer ence of energy. The phenomenon is governed by the composition, the form and the dimensions of the core, by the value and the construction characteristics of the inductive and oscillatory circuits and by the reciprocal position of the components with respect to the core. This method for the continuous conversion of magnetic values into electrical values is based on the determined premagnetization of various core types of one or various inductive and oscillatory circuits, to obtain significant elec trical changes in these circuits, by little alterations of the initial premagnetization.

## Description
Method of High Sensibility, Stability and Efficiency for the Continuous Conversion of Magnetic Values into Electrical ValuesThe spectacular development of electronics in the last few decades has not been paralleled by progress in the field of magnetic transducers for constant values or slowly varying values.Complicated and costly methods, such as nuclear resonance, specially constructed cathode ray tubes, rubidium vapor magnetometers, etc., have applications limited to special cases, and most of the devices, instruments and appliances for such applications are equipped with Hall effect elements, which are more efficient than the magneto resistance.All these sophisticated or simple transducers have an efficiency between the lowest compulsorily acceptable, and sensitivities which are comparable to that of a compass.Moreover, the small tensions which they supply, require a big amplification in continuous current, an area in which not even modern electronics has solved the problem.The small variation of temperature induces appreciable drift, and the tendency to instability complicate the amplification of such tensions.On a world scale, the shortage and price of the devices for magnetic measurement constitutes a handicap in many sectors of scientific investigation and activities including also satellites which are to carry out magnetic space exploration.Nevertheless, a method exists, based on a phenomenon probably ignored until now, which offers a different perspective. The description follows If the core of a suitably coupled circuit, almost syn chronized with an external oscillator, is magnetized without saturating small alterations of the premagnetization or of the Foucault currents, provoke large variations of the tension in said circuit.If the core, common to a local oscillator, or to a primary fed by an external oscillator and at a given distance to a circuit almost synchronized with the frequency, is premagnetized without saturating small alterations of the premagnetization provoke large variations in the value of the induced tension.The alterations of the premagnetization can be caused by changes in the environmental magnetic field in the case of the open cores, or by small changes in the current which circulates through a winding situated on the same core, in all the cores.The phenomenon can be more or less observed using any type of core and at all frequencies to an upper limit, governed by the losses of the core.The rate, form and linearity of the electrical variation are governed by the relative positioning of the components, by the intensity of the premagnetization and by the almost synchronization of one or more of the circuits with the utilized frequency, and also of other known factors.Enumerating the conditions and the factors which determine the phenomenon, the fundamental characteristic in all its practical applications is evident the premagnetization without saturating of the core of a coil or inductive circuit, or of the core common to various inductive and osciallatory circuits.The possible practical variables allow an indefinite number of potential applications, such as various magnetic transducers, orientation in the terrestrial magnetic field, continuous current amplifier, detector of metallic accumulations, proximity detector, vibration detector and transducer, amplitude and frequency modulator, electrical field detector, seismograph, etc.Bearing in mind from the beginning that the progress in electronics is more than unsatisfactory concerning continuous magnetic transducers and the amplification of small continuous tensions, we shall analyse the phenomenon in this type of application, and implicitly in others, making reference to the figures of the attached drawing setting out at the same time, and after the final observations, the bases of the method of high sensitivity, stability and efficiency to convert small magnetic values constant or variable, into large electrical values, constant or variable.If in figures 1 and 3 we exclude S1 S2 P2, and P1 constitutes a circuit, suitably coupled and almost synchronized with an external oscillator, significant amplitude variations appear in the alternating tension existins at the extremes of P1 when a modification of the environmental magnetic field is produced, or when theFoucault currents are modified by the presence or movement of a material diamagnetic or paramagnetic electrical conductor, in the vicinity of the core. The inductance set up on a core with an air gap of suitable dimensions fig. 4 allows measurements on magnetic fields in reduced spaces, to detect the presence and nature of metallic bodies, electrical fields, etc.If in figures 1, 2, 3, 4, we exclude only S1, and P1 is suitably coupled and almost synchronized with an external oscillator, and P2 constitutes the load of an amplifier stage of a small continuous tension, the minimum variations of the current which circulates throughP2, provoke large variations in the tension induced inS2. To avoid alterations through changes in the environmental magnetic field, closed cores, fig. 2 or cores with a small air gap fig. 4 may be used. If, in the same case, P1 is fed by a frequency carrier and P2 by a modulator, the frequency P1, modulated in amplitude by the frequency P2, will appear in S2.If in figures 1,2,3,4, P1 S1 constitute a local oscillator, the current variations in P2 provoke significant variations of amplitude and frequency, detectable and measureable in S2.If in the above case S2 is almost synchronized with the frequency of the local oscillator, largely parallel amplitude variations may appear in S1, dependent upon the intensity of the premagnetization M and of the constructive characteristics of the circuit.Different type of cores and assembling are used according to the purpose. The difference between the two open cores shown in figs. 1 and 3 is that the transducer set up in accordance with fig. 1, allows a symmetry of sensitivity to be obtained in the two extremes.It is important to note that in all cases A continuous output tension can be obtained, recti fying and filtering the tension to be measured. As the windings S1 and S2 can have a much higher number of turns than P1, the output tension of the transducer can have much higher values than the tension used for the power supply. As the winding P2 can have a much higher number of turns as a load of an amplifier stage of a continuous tension, the resulting amplification surpasses that of a classical stage, with less temperature drift and good stability, owing to the electrical insu lation created between successive stages. To be able to judge the prospects of possible practical applications, I would like to give comparative data of transducers for magnetometers, utilizing two types ofHall elements of a recently developed different technology, and a new transducer set up according to fig. 3,For maximum sensitivity each Hall element has been fixed between two ferrite bars of 6,3 mm type 3D3, manufactured by Hispano Ferritas Spain , with a total length of 26,5 cm the new transducer has been made with the same type of bar, 24 cm in length.The established power supply tension is 1,5 V. The current consumption in each case is. 3 mA for the Hall elements GaAs of JVC, type VHG 210 6 mA for the Hall element InSb of Asahi Chemical, type H300A. 0,24 mA for the new transducer.The variation of the continuous output tension through 2 3600 horizontal rotation in the terrestrial magnetic field in Las Palmas about 30.000 gamma measured on a resistance of 10 Mg is 1,7 mV in the case of the Hall element type VHG 210 13 mV in the case of the Hall element type H300A 13,2 V 13.200 mV in the case of the new transducer. In conclusion the new transducer has a sensitivity of at least a thousand times greater, supplying tensions without problems of amplification, and the efficiency is in excess of 25.000 times the efficiency of the modern Hall elements. As all the experiments have been carried out only with materials in existence of the open market, and with reduced means, the possible achievement of an extensive range of devices, instruments and appliances can be expected, when more suitable means and materials are available.After the spectacular results already obtained under these conditions, it does not seem rash to state that the method constitures an important step forward in fundamental electronics, and a means of facilitating significant progress in other scientific sectors.
