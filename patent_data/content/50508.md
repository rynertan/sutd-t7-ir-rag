# ORIGINAL FEEDER FOR COPYING MACHINES

## Abstract
The original document feeder automatically positions originals of any substance on the exposure surface 15 , so avoiding opening and closing the original pressing cover at each change of original, and with a considerable reduction in idle times. The feeder comprises a set of spaced friction wheels 31 of flexible material mounted on a single shaft 30 , these wheels facing into a transverse channel 40 so as to compel each original sheet to bend in such a manner as to exert a force against the wheels 31 which is the greater the higher the substance or rigidity of the sheets. The feeder is also provided with a stop 74 for automatically aligning the originals, and a timer system for coordinating the con veying stages of the originals with the copying machine cycle. The stop is moved by the advancing original and actuates a microswitch 90 to stop the motor 66 driving the advancing belts 60 . In an alternative, the original rides over unidirectional aligning stops and is then driven back against these by reversing the motor 66 .
