## Description
PROCESS FOR PREPARING 3,5 DIAMINO 1,2,4 TRIAZOLES This invention relates to a new process for preparing 3,5 diamino l,2,4 triazoles using diphenylN cyanoimidocarbonate as a starting material. In addition, this invention relates to new intermediates in this process. The 3,5 diamino 1,2,4 triazoles which may be prepared by the process of this invention have been described as having histamine H2 receptor blocking activity in U.K. Patent Application GB 2,023,133A, published December 28, 1979. In particular, the following 3,5 diamino 1,2,4 triazoles which are described therein are prepared by the process of this invention EMI1.1 FORMULA I in which R1 and R2 are each lower alkyl or R1 andR2 may, together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl or hexamethyleneiminyl ring Q is a furan or benzene ring n is O or 1 m is 2 or 3 X is sulphur when n is 1, m is 2 and Q is furan, and X is oxygen when n is 0, m is 3 and Q is benzene and R3 is hydrogen or lower alkyl. As disclosed in U.K. Patent ApplicationGB 2,023,133A, the compounds of Formula I have pharmacological activity as selective histamineH2 antagonists,andcompounds with histamine H2 blocking activity may be used in the treatment of conditions where there is a hypersecretion of gastric acid, and in the treatment of allergic and inflammatory conditions where histamine is a mediator. Several methods of preparing 3,5 diamino 1,2,4triazoles are disclosed in G.B. 2,023,133A,one of them being the reaction of a hydrazine with a compound of the formula EMI2.1 in which L is defined as a leaving group, for example a lower alkoxy or lower alkylthio group. According to the process of this invention, 3,5 diamino 1,2,4 triazoles.are prepared by a procedure in which diphenyl N cyanoimidocarbonate is reacted with a substituted amine and the resulting O phenyl isourea intermediate is reacted with d hydrazine. The process of this invention provides high yields of the 3,5 diamino1,2,4 triazoles. It is advantageous over the process in which L is lower alkylthio because it avoids the toxic and malodorous mercaptans evolved in that process. In the process of this invention, the leaving group is phenoxy which is a superior leaving group L and is advantageous over lower alkoxy since the reaction can be carried out in high yield under mild conditions. Also, the intermediates with L s phenoxy are more stable than the lower alkoxy analogues. The process of this invention is represented as follows EMI3.1 FORMULA IIIEMI3.2 FORMULA IThe term Y is phenyl and R1, R2, Q, n, m, X and R3 are as defined above. The diphenyl N cyanoimidocarbonate is reacted with an equimolar amount of an amine of Formula II in an inert solvent such as ethyl acetate, isopropanol or other alcohols, tetrahydrofuran, dioxan, acetonitrile or preferably ethyl ether at about room temperature to give the O phenyl isourea intermediate Formula III . These O phenyl isoureas are the new intermediate compounds of this invention. The O phenyl isourea is reacted with a hydrazine in an inert solvent at elevated temperature, for example in ethyl ether or isopropanol at reflux temperature, to give the 3,5 diamino 1,2,4 triazoles of Formula I. Alternatively, to prepare the compounds in whichR3 is lower alkyl, the O phenyl isourea may be reacted with at N lower alkylhydrazine having a N protecting group such as a N phenylmethylene group. The reaction may be carried out in an inert solvent such as isopropanol at about room temperature, followed by treatment with dilute hydrochloric acid to remove the protecting group and cyclize to give the 3,5 diamino 1,2,4 triazoles. Also, the diaminotriazoles may be prepared by reacting diphenyl N cyanoimidocarbonate first with a Nlower alkyl N protected hydrazine, then reacting the resulting intermediate with an amine of Formula II and treating the resulting intermediate with dilute hydrochloric acid to give the 3,5 diamino 1,2,4 triazoles. The diphenyl N cyanoimidocarbonate starting material is prepared by the following procedure EMI4.1 in which Y is phenyl. According to this procedure, diphenyl carbonate is reacted with phosphorus pentachloride at 150 160 to form l,l dichloro l,ldiphenoxymethane which is reacted with cyanamide in an inert organic solvent at temperatures below 800, preferably at room temperature. All temperatures herein are in degrees Centigrade. The invention is illustrated but not limited by the following examples.
