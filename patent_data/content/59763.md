# D.C. GENERATOR TYPE NON CONTACT SPEED SENSING DEVICE.

## Abstract
In a D.C. generator type non contact speed sensing device including a cylindrical permanent magnet rotor 1 with N and S poles alternating around its periphery, a stator 2 with output windings 4 wound thereon confronting the rotor 1 , a position sensing permanent magnet 3 rotating coaxially with the rotor 1 , magnetic sensing switches 5 arranged in the vicinity of the periphery of the position sensing magnet, and the flat portion of a multi phase A.C. trapezoidal wave form being sampled by the switching operation of the switches 5 in response to the rotating position of the position sensing magnet 3 so as to produce a D.C. voltage proportional to the rotating speed, the S pole region and the N pole region in the position sensing magnet 3 are continuously formed such that the resultant magnetic field is sharply inverted from one polarity to the other polarity and the ratio of the width of the S pole region to that of the N pole region is determined by other than 1 such that the switches 5 samples only the flat portion of the multi phase A.C. trapezoidal waveform induced in the output windings, without being influenced by changes in the operational level of the switches, so as to obtain a D.C. voltage with no ripple.
