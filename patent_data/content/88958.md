# Stabilization of azulene derivatives.

## Abstract
Sodium 1,4 dimethylisopropylazulene 3 sulfonate ex hibits antiinflammatory and anti ulcer actions, but it is unstable even in solid state. It has been found that it can be stabilized against heating by a method, in which to a solution of sodium 1,4 dimethylisopropylazulene 3 sulfonate is added a physiologically non toxic additive and then the solvent is removed or separated therefrom by spray drying or lyophilization.
