# Semiconductor integrated circuit protection arrangement.

## Abstract
An array of semiconductor circuits 16, 26, 96 integrated in a single semiconductor body substrate, each circuit 16, 26, 96 having a separate input terminal 16.5, 26.5 96.5 , is pro tected from overvoltages in the inputs by means of a separate diode 17, 27, 97 for each such circuit connected between its protected input node and a reference terminal V
