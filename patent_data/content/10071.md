## Description
An apparatus for the automatic determination in percentage of the volume of particles in suspension in a liquid.The present invention relates to apparatuses for the automatic determination of the percentage of the volume of particles in suspension in a liquid. More specifically the apparatus of the present invention relates to a determination and or a measure and or . detection of homogenous groupings in a determined fi eld of particles in suspension in a liquid.A very specific and convenient application of the apparatus of ti present invention is in the volumetric determination of blood corpuscles which are in an aqueos suspension with addlti ves and more specifically of the red corpuscles.It is well know for instance, that in the specific case of blood diagnosis, the laboratories which are equipped to make such determinations, have available some apparatuses which are capable of measuring predetermined parameters of red cor puscles which are placed in aqueos solution in a small contai ner containing a suitable additive.These parameters essentially consist of the following a numerical calculation with reference to a predetermi ed unit of volume, for instance mm3, that is the number of red corpuscles in a specified volume The average volume of the corpuscles which have been cai lated, that is the volume obtained from the sum of the volu mes of the small corpuscles, that is the corpuscles which ha ve been computed divided by the number of the corpuscles whi ch have been computed. This is the arithmetical average. The total volume of the corpuscles in percentage of the to tal volume of the blood being analyzed. The device which is ordinarily used for this determination is the hematocrit.These results or parameters are essentially obtained with two types of apparatuses The first type is an apparatus functioning electrostatical ly, which utilizes a laser beam and which measures the diffu sion of light at a fixed angle of 15 30 , which apparatus converts the optical signal based on the source of light into an electronic impulse which has a definite duration and a de finite amplitude, the latter being the height of the signal on a screen, so that this amplitude results proportional to the volume of every blood corpuscle being analyzed. The second type consists of an electrical apparatus which determines variations in the electrical resistance or capaci ty due to the passage of the same corpuscles in an aqueous suspension. Also in this apparatus these variations of resis tance and or capacity cause electric signals to be emanated, which signals are characterized by an amplitude and a durati on as with the preceding type of apparatuses.All these types of apparatuses present the drawback that they do not give accurate results, particulary in the case when im purities are present in the environment and when impurities are present in the solution which are computed as if they we re corpuscles.A further drawback of the well know apparatuses resides in the fact that the coincidence of signals due, for instance, to the passage of corpusc , which ate r one next to the other, generates a signal which is not representative of a single corpuscle and therefore the results are incorrect.In view of these drawbacks, in order to obtain more accurate results, it is necessary to repeat the analysis several times, keeping in mind that even in this manner there is no guarant ee that the results will exactly correspond to the true valu es.An object of the present invention is to eliminate the draw backs mentioned hereinabove.Another object of the present invention is to provide a novel apparatus connectable to the prior art apparatus which deter mines the volume of the small particles or globules only in the real environment, that is excluding the instances of abno rmal detection, for instance due to globules being one next to the other.Still another object of the present invention is to provide the percentages of the corpuscles present at different levels of volume as it will be illustrated more clearly hereinbelow.It is well know that red corpuscles have a volume which vari es generally for each individual corpuscle between 50 and 200 t 3 and the apparatuses know in the art give an average v lue of measure, for instance Vm 87 3 determined on the ba sis of the following formula V Vm n in which V is the total volume of the particles being compu ted and n is the total number of particles being computedIt is evident that, when a great number of small particles close one to the other or even adjacent one. to the other o es through, there is an error in the computation with res ct to the value of th voium of v because V is the vol e of a single computation and therefore an error also in the va lue of V which is equal to v1 v2 v3 ... vn. This obviou sly causes inaccuracies in the results as it has been mentio ned hereinabove.With the apparatus of the present invention it is possible to eliminate these anomalous data, which data are considered ano malous either because of the duration of the signal or becau se of the amplitude of the signal itself, that is the height of the impulse, for instance on the screen.By utilizing these data which are freed of anomalous data, it is possible to established a percentage distribution of the corpuscles within a certain number of pre established volume levels.By way of example, in the field mentioned hereinabove, it has been found convenient to divide the entire field in nine lev els. In this manner considering the field limited between va lues 50 194 A 3 one will have 194 50 144, 3 144 9 16A of field for each so that one will have the following level distribution 50 66 3 66 82t 82 98 98 114 3 114 130 3 144 130 3 130 146 3 146 162 162 178 3 178 194 3.Naturally depending upon the specific requirements, the leve ls may be differenciated in a manner other than the extens ion of equal field as described hereinabove.The apparatus according to the present invention is so cons tructed that it permits to draw in progression, to recognize and classify in a simple manner the data measured in the seve ral levels and it permits to totalize these data because it supplies the data in the following three forms 1 a digital numerical presentation of the percentages for each level in a sequential automatic or manual manner 2 printing of the data by means of a alphanumerical printer 3 recordal of the graph on a screen and or on paper.This results is schieved by means of an apparatus which is us ed in conjunction with existing apparatuses.According to one embodiment of the invention, it is also pos sible to build a single complex apparatus which is integrated with the apparatuses know in the art.The apparatus according to the present invention essentially consists of the following a connector which withdraws electric signals which repres ent the amplitude height , duration of the impulse and num ber, red corpuscles which are being analyzed as well as the signal of initial computation and of the end of the computa tion, the relative details of the apparatuses know in the art hereinafter referred to as pre existing apparatuses are not mentioned a filter which leaves out the impulses which represent ano malous properties such as the duration and the height outside of a predetermined field pre established by the operator the discriminant of the height which conveys in each single field of level the impulses falling within the same field and conveys them separately partial accumulators or partial memories, one for each preestablished field, for instance nine memories in the case il lustrated hereinabove an elaborating totalizer of the partial memories connected with the memories, which with a total pre established number of the corpuscles being analyzed, blocks the analysis cf the signals and proceeds with the elaboration of the t with the emission of the same data a sequensor which transfer the signals from the elaborating totalizer and from the partial memories onto means of percept ion of the same, for instance visual means numerical or digi tal, analogical, in the form of graphs which may be written and or visualized on a screen .The structural features of the apparatus of the present inven tion mentioned hereinabove will be better understood and othe rs will appear more clear from the following detailed descriE tion of one example by reference to the attached drawings of which in particular Fig. 1 is a diagram which provides a schematic representati on in blocks of the apparatus according to the present inven tion Fig. 2 is a graphic representation of one first result of analysis Fig. 3 is a second graphic representation of a second analZ sis Fig. 4 is a third graphic representation of another analz sis.As show in Fig. 1, the pre existing apparatuses of analysis of the corpuscles according to the present invention are re presented by the letter A.

This discriminant transmits the impulses in accordance with a pre established number of levels onto con ductors 4.In the specific case illustrated hereinabove nine conductors 4 are used a group of partial memories designated by numeral 5 for the storage of the various impulses differenciated in each field of level received from the conductor 4 an elaborating totalizer 6 connected to conductors 4 a sequensor 8 for alternate presentation of the data by mea ns of exit conductor 10 for each field of level, connected to the partial memories with conductors 7 and with the elaborat ing totalizer by means of conductor 9 a digital monitor 11 which is numerical and or alphanumeri cal and which converts the data transmitted by the sequensor and which is connectable with an alphanumerical printer for printing the data and which is further connected with a digital analogical converter 12 which elaborates the data and converts them in an analogical form because it is provi ded with means for the transmittal and connection with an paratus for the representation of the data which have been elaborated in the form of graphs on paper or on a monitor.The latter is represented in the block figure by numerals 13 and 14 while the printer is represented by numeral 15.Figures 2, 3 and 4 respectively represent three graphs histo grams of three different analysis.
