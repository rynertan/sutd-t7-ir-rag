# Process for producing vitamin B12 by the fermentation technique, and vitamin B12 producing microorganism.

## Abstract
A process for producing vitamin B₁₂ by the fermentation technique which comprises cultivating a vitamin B₁₂ producing microorganism belonging to the genus Proprioni bacterium in a culture medium containing a carbon source and a nitrogen source, and collecting vitamin B₁₂ accumu lated in the cells of the microorganism charcterized in that 1 cultivation is carried out while adding a base to maintain the pH at 5 to 7.5, and 2 cultivation is carried out while adding a carbon source portionwise to the cultivation system nearly within 10 minutes of adding the base, 3 provided that when a vitamin B₁₂ producing micro organism having resistance to proprionic acid is used as the microorganism, the portionwise addition of the carbon source in 2 can be omitted and a proprionic acid resistant, vitamin B₁₂ producing microorganism of the genus Proprioni bacterium.
