# JUNCTION PIECES FOR ELECTRIC CONDUIT

## Abstract
Junction pieces 110 for joining electric cable conduit are made from mouldable plastics material in the traditional shapes of elbows, small bends, and T junctions and comprise a base portion 100 with sockets 130 for receiving the cable conduit at each end, and a cover portion 140 . The base portion 100 is cut away in the middle to provide access for inspection of the cable and to facilitate manipulation of the conduit when inserting it into the junction piece 110 . The cover portion 140 fits over the cut away part of the base portion 100 and is retained on the base portion by snap engagement means 123, 143 . When in place, the cover 140 fits flush with the top and sides of the sockets 130 .
