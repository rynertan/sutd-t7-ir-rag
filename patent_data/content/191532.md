# X ray examining device.

## Abstract
An X ray examining device in accordance with the invention includes an X ray source, an object carrier, an X ray detector and a curved stray radiation grid which is arranged between the object carrier and an entrance window of the X ray detector. In order to obtain images at different irradiation angles, rotation of X ray source and X ray detector about, for example a patient to be examined is necessary. In inclined positions of the X ray detector, however, imaging is not optimum because the distance between the X ray source and the entrance screen of the X ray detector must be increased because of the customary flat shape of the stray radiation grid. Moreover, the stray radiation grid will also absorp a comparatively large amount of X rays when the X ray detector is not ideally positioned. These drawbacks are elimi nated when use is made of a stray radiation grid in which either the direction of curvature is identical or opposed to that of the curvature of the entrance window of the X ray detector, or the direction of curvature is identical to that of the curvature of the object carrier.

## Description
X ray examining device. The invention relates to an X ray examining device which includes an X ray source, an object carrier, an X ray detection system having a curved entrance window, and a stray radiation geid which is mounted between the object carrier and an entrance side of the detection system. An X ray examining device of this kind is known from U.S. 4,220,890. The X ray examining device described therein comprises an X ray detector in the form of an X ray image intensifier tubde. A stray radiation grid is arranged in front of an entrance window of the X ray image intensifier tube. After having irradiated an object to be examined, a beam of image carrying X rays from the X ray source passes through the stray radiation geid and subsequently through the entrance window. Inside the X ray image intensifier tube an entrance screen is provided on the entrance win dow, said screen consisting of, for example a layer of S I c on which a photocathode is provided. In this screen an image carrying X ray beam is converted into a beam of photo electrons. Electrons emerging from the photocathode are accelerated to, for example 25 kV after which they are imaged on a luminescent exit screen.Via an exit window, an image carrying light beam emerges from the X ray intensifier tube by means of which, for example a photographic plate can be exposed or a television image can be formed. In order to obtain images in different irradiation directions, rotation of the X ray source and the detection system about an object to be examined will be required. When use is made of a flat stray radiation grid, the image formation will not be optimum in inclined positions of the X ray image intensifier tube, because the distance between the X ray image intensifier tube and the object necessarily increases because of the geometry of the stray radiation grid. Because of this comparatively long distance in the case of irradiation in inclined positions, the X ray source is often moved to an ideal angular position during a measurement, but the X ray detection system is not. Consequently, the image formation will not be optimum and the stray radiation grid will exhibit a locally inhomogeneous radiation absorption.Consequently, for adequate illumination across the entire entrance surface of the detection system the intensity of the X ray beam will have to be increased this is undesirable because such an increase will result in a higher radiation dose. It is the object of the invention to eliminate these drawbacks to this end, an X ray examining device of the kind set forth is characterized in that the stray radiation grid comprises radiation sbsorbing laminations, either the direction of a curvature of the stray radiation grid being identical or opposed to that of a curvature of the curved entrance window, or the direction of a curvature of the stray radiation grid being identical to that of a curvature of the object carrier. From U.S. Patent Specification 2,760,077 a stray radiation grid is known which has the same curvature as a convex viewed from the X ray source entrance window, but this grid does not comprise radiation absorbing laminations. The stray radiation grid in said U.S. PatentSpecification includes a coil for absorbing secondary radiation, which coil, however, is difficult to construct. When the stray radiation grid is curved in the same direction in the case of a convex entrance window viewed from the X ray source , the distance between the object to be examined and the entrance screen can be reduced during rotation of the X ray image forming system about the object to be examined, so that image forming can be enhanced. The X ray detection system of an embodiment of an X ray examining device in accordance with the invention is formed by an X ray film camera having a cylindrically curved entrance screen, the object carrier being adapted to said curvature in order to minimize the focal distance. In the case of a concave detection system entrance viewed from the X ray source , a focusing stray radiation grid can be comparatively easily realized by adaptation to the divergence of the incident X ray beam. This notably holds good for cylindrically curved stray radiation grids. In that case it will merely be necessary to mount the laminations, being flat per se, in accordance with the divergence of the incident X ray beam. Notably in the case of a non focusing stray radiation grid, the grid can be connected at option to the object carrier or to the detection system. Some embodiments in accordance with the invention will be described in detail hereinafter with reference to the drawing. Therein figure 1 shows an X ray examining device in which the stray radiation grid is curved in the same direction as the concave entrance window viewed from theX ray source , and figure 2 shows an X ray examining device in which the stray radiation grid is curved so as to be concave viewed from the X ray source , and connected to anX ray film camera. An X ray examining device as shown in figure 1 includes an X ray source 1 with a high voltage source 2, an object carrier 3 for a patient 4 to be examined, anX ray image intensifier tube 5, a basic objective 6, a semi transparent mirror 7, a film camera 8, a television camera tube 9 with a beam deflection coil 10, and a television monitor 71, The X ray image intensifier tube 5 includes an entrance screen 12 with not separwtely shown an X ray luminescent screen which is preferably made of C I and which is provided on the inner side, and a photo 5 cathode, an electron optical system which includes one or more intermediate electrodes 15 in addition to the entrance screen 12 and an exit screen 13 which is in this case provided on the inner side of an exit window 14.The entrance screen 12 is mounted on the inner side of an entrance window 22. Furthermore, a ferromagnetic shielding jacket 21 may be provided around the X ray image intensifier tube.An incident X ray beam 16 irradiates the patient 4 and a transmitted image carrying X ray beam 17 is incident on the entrance screen of the X ray image intensifier tube.The X ray beam 17 incident on the entrance screen is converted into a beam of photo electrons 18 which is accelerated to, for example, 25 kV and imaged on the exit screen 13. Via the exit screen 14 an image carrying light beam 19 emerges which can be used, as desired, to expose a photographic plate or to form a television image. In accordance with the invention, between the patient and theX ray image intensifier tube there is arranged a convex stray radiation grid 20 viewed from the X ray source .This grid intercepts X rays whose propagation direction deviates excessively, for example due to dispersion in the patient, from the propagation direction of the beam 17.During rotation of the X ray image intensifier tube about the patient which is necessary in order to obtain images at different irradiation angles, the distance between the patient to be examined and the entrance screen can be minimized because of the convex shape of the stray radiation grid. Consequently, the image formation is improved. The stray radiation grid includes laminations 23 which are focused in accordance with the divergence of the image carrying X rays in order to homogenize the X ray absorption. An X ray examining device as shown in figure 2 includes an X ray source 1 with a high voltage source 2, an object carrier 3 for a patient 4 to be examined, a stray radiation grid 5 and an X ray film camera 6. The object carrier 3 and the stray radiation grid 5 are both concave, viewed from the X ray source. The absorption of the X rays can be homogenized and hence minimized by adapting the direction of the laminations 7 of the stray radiation grid to the divergence of the image carryingX ray beam. In the case of focusing stray radiation grids the curvature of the detection entrance window or screen is preferably chosen so that the centre of curvature coincides with the object focal point of the X ray source. In that case the laminations can be simply mounted perpendicularly to the entrance window. The X ray source and, for example the stray radiation grid connected to the X ray film camera in figure 2, should then remain in a fixed mutual position. To this end, in the embodiment shown in figure 2 the X ray source via a holder 8 as well as theX ray film camera is connected to a so called C arc 9 for combined rotation about the object. Notably for comparatively small rotations it may badvantageous to use a fixed position of the source and the detection system and to position the object to be examined so as to be rotatable.
