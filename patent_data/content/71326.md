# Nuclear power plant.

## Abstract
An organic cooled nuclear reactor power plant utilises a single pass of organic liquid for both the cooling the neutron moderation. The dual function of the organic coolant can be achieved at relatively low pressures which make it possible for an emergency cooling system to be provided, comprising a reservoir 26 of organic coolant for flooding the reactor core 6 and cooling via heat exchangers it in a post accident situation without utilising any prime mover or external power source.
