# Microwave transmitting and receiving arrangements.

## Abstract
A radar system having a common antenna for transmit ting and receiving signals conventionally includes a branch duplexer which is bulky and inconvenient. By using a waveguide section having an antenna port 21 at one end and a receiver port 22 at the other, and including a protection unit comprising p.i.n. diodes 19 and 20, these difficulties are reduced. The diodes 19 and 20 prevent transmitted energy from a magnetron 14 reaching the receiver port 22 but allow received energy, because of its lower amplitude, to pass.
