# Method, test strain and test kit for the laboratory diagnosis of neisseria gonorrhoeae.

## Abstract
A strain of Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 31953 is described which has characteristically poor growth on chocolate agar at a temperature range of about 30 C to about 37 C in a COâ‚‚ atmosphere suitable for growth of N. gonorrhoeae. This strain is resistant to nalidixic acid at the 5 10 mcg ml level and resistant to streptomycin at the 1000 mcg ml level or greater. The strain is suitable for a method for the laboratory diagnosis of gonorrhea, comprising the steps of 1 preparing a test strain of the microorganism Neisseria gonorrhoeae which is competent for transforma tion, 2 extracting N. gonorrhoeae DNA from a patient s specimen material or colonies suspected of being N. gonor rhoeae whether in pure or mixed culture by treatment with a base which lyses N. gonorrhoeae, 3 adusting the pH of the extract of step 2 to a pH that is not toxic to the test strain, 4 applying the pH adjusted extract to the test strain before or after putting it on or into a biological medium suitable for growth of N. gonorrhoeae, 5 maintaining the treated test strain at optimum N. gonorrhoeae growth conditions which are inhibitory for the test strain and 6 observing for detectable growth of the treated test strain. The observance of growth indicates detection of N. gonorrhoeae DNA. Also described is a test kit for performing the method.
