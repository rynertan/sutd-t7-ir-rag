# Phonograph.

## Abstract
A phonograph comprising means for damping un wanted horizontal and vertical vibrations of a pick up cart ridge 3 on an arm 1 . The damping means comprises a paddle 10 moving in a trough 11 of viscous fluid. The paddle is fixed to the arm 1 near the pick up cartridge 3 . The trough 11 is fixed during use to extend with clearance above a record surface. The damping means thus acts to damp the pick up cartridge, giving relatively low damping below 5 Hz, mode rate damping between 5 Hz and 20 Hz and high damping above 20 Hz. The resonance frequency between arm and stylus can be adjusted to be too high to be initiated by warps and too low to fall within the audio bandwidth, by using a counter balance mass 7 comprising a plurality of individually re movable interfitting annular rings. Known phonograph damping, acting far from the pick up cartridge, is subject to more complex vibration modes, e.g. torsional vibrations of the arm, at high frequencies.
