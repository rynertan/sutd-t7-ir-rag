# Process and catalyst for performing hydroformylation reactions.

## Abstract
The invention concerns a catalyst for hydroformylation reactions and its application. The catalyst is prepared by phosphochlorination of an organic polymer carrier in the presence of borontrifluoride or a complex thereof, followed by conversion of the chlorophosphonyl groups into phos phine or phosphite groups, which through their ligand forming action bind a catalytically active metal complex to the carrier. The novel catalysts are stable and highly active.
