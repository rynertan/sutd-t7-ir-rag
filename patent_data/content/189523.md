## Description
The present invention relates to a microprocessor system configured by connecting a memory and or I O having an n 2 bit data bus width to a microprocessor having an n bit data bus width. Semiconductor technology has developed in recent years to allow creation of a high performance computer system through a combination of a microprocessor and its peripheral control LSIs DMA controller, etc. , and to the extent that computer systems can be designed with ease. Furthermore, 8 bit microprocessors are gradually being replaced with 16 and 32 bit microprocessors, and microprocessor capability has been reinforced. However, most currently available peripheral control LSIs are operated on an 8 bit operation basis. For example, when a 16 bit microprocessor controls a peripheral control LSI with an 8 bit data bus width, two byte transfer instructions are used in place of one word transfer instruction. In this manner, a programmer must create a program by considering combinations of the architecture of the system and executable instructions 1 2 4 byte access instructions or the like . Since a word transfer instruction cannot be used in the 8 bit peripheral control LSI, existing software for 16 bit microprocessors must be rewritten such that a 16 bit word instruction is replaced with two byte transfer instructions. The prior art will be described hereinafter. Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a conventional microprocessor system. The system comprises a microprocessor µCPU 8086 1, a bus controller BUS CTRLR 2, a latch LATCH 3, a bus transceiver TRANSCEIVER 4, a memory and or I O MEMORY AND OR I O to be referred to as a memory hereinafter 5 having a 16 bit data bus width, and a system bus 6. The microprocessor 1 comprises, for example, a microprocessor 8086 available from Intel Corp., U.S.A. The microprocessor 1 receives a clock CLK and sends status data STS1 to the controller 2. Upon reception of the data STS1, the controller 2 supplies a read write control signal The operation of the microprocessor system will be described. Figs. 2A to 2E are timing charts explaining a read cycle word transfer instruction starting from an even address in the circuit of Fig. 1. The machine cycle basically consists of clocks CLK T1, T2, T3 and T4, as shown in Fig. 2A. In the read cycle starting from the even address, the microprocessor 1 generates the address and the status data in response to the clock T1, as shown in Fig. 2B. The controller 2 supplies the signal ALE to the latch 3 in response to the status data, as shown in Fig. 2D. The controller 2 supplies the signal The microprocessor 1 fetches the data at the trailing edge of the clock T3. In the word transfer instruction of the read cycle starting from an odd address, there are two access cycles. Data fetching is performed in the same manner as in the read cycle starting from an even address. However, in the first access cycle, the data corresponding to the start even address is fetched as the most significant part of the 16 bit data. The address is then updated, and in the second access cycle, the data corresponding to the start odd address is fetched as the least significant part. In this manner, 16 bit data is thus fetched by the microprocessor 1. The above operation can be performed in the same manner as in the word transfer instruction of the write cycle. As is apparent from the above description, the prior art microprocessor system has a 16 byte boundary. Although one address has 1 byte data, the address has, as its objective, a memory of basically a 16 bit data bus width. For this reason, the microprocessor system configuration is not flexible, resulting in inconvenience see MEMORY ORGANIZATION of MICROPROCESSOR AND PERIPHERALS HANDBOOK 1983 published by Intel Corp. for further reference . Prior art document E.D.N. Electrical design news, volume 29, number 16, 9th August 1984, pages 199 to 206 discloses a method for automatically converting a word transfer instruction to two 1 2 word transfer instructions in a microprocessor system configured by connecting a memory and or I O with a n 2 bit data bus width to a microprocessor with a n bit data bus width. This method comprises the steps of a extracting a read write control signal for said memory and or I O from status data generated from said microprocessor when said microprocessor executes the word transfer instruction, supplying the read write control signal together with an address to said memory and or I O setting a bus converter for connecting a data bus coupled to said memory and or I O with a n bit data bus width, and starting a first access cycle, and b causing said microprocessor to inhibit generation of the read write control signal to complete the word transfer instruction. Further in a first step a first access cycle for said memory and or I O is performed said first step comprising Whereas above E.D.N. document describes an even read cycle and an even write cycle wherein the low byte is first transfered, the address updated by adding 1 to it and then the higher byte is transfered, prior art document COMPUTER DESIGN, vol. 24, no. 1, January 1985, pages 187 194, 196, 198, Littleton, Massachusetts, US M.S. YOUNG et al. Mixing data paths expands options in system design , discloses an odd read cycle and an odd write cycle wherein the higher byte is first transfered. It is an object of the present invention to provide microprocessor system and method that can automatically convert a word transfer instruction to two byte transfer instructions. To solve this object the present invention provides a microprocessor system and a method as defined in claims 1 and 11, respectively. According to the microprocessor system of the present invention, a software programmer need not selectively use the word transfer instruction and the byte transfer instruction in accordance with the data bus width of the memory and or I O. In other words, the programmer can always use word transfer instructions. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which The present invention will be described in detail with reference to a preferred embodiment. Fig. 3 is a block diagram of a microprocessor system configured by connecting a memory and or I O 17 having an 8 bit data bus width to a 16 bit microprocessor 11. At first the architecture of the system will be described with reference to Fig. 3. The microprocessor system comprises the microprocessor 11, a read write controller 12, an address latch counter 13, a timing generator 14, a bus converter 15, a 16 bit memory and or I O 16, the 8 bit memory and or I O 17, and a system bus 18. The timing generator 14 further comprises a detector 19, a counter 20, and a timing controller 21. The microprocessor 11 receives a clock CLK and a wait control signal The address latch counter 13 comprises a latch 61 and a counter 62, as shown in Fig. 7. The latch 61 latches the address ADR 19 0 from the microprocessor 11 in response to the signal ALE from the controller 12. An address ADR 19 0 is supplied to the counter 62 and the detector 19. The least significant bit ADR 0 of the address is supplied to the controller 21. The counter 62 receives, as a preset value, the output from the latch 61, and is counted up in response to a signal of logic 1 from the controller 21. The updated address data is supplied from the counter 62 to the memories and or I Os 16 and 17 through a bus ADDR 19 0 and the bus 18. The detector 19 comprises a decoder 41 and gates 42 and 43, as shown in Fig. 5. The decoder 41 decodes the address data ADR 19 0 generated from the counter 13 and supplies the decoded result to the gate 43. The gate 42 calculates the NAND product of the read write control signals When a predetermined period of time has elapsed, the delay 52 supplies a signal to the pulser 53. The pulser 53 supplies a signal The operation of the microprocessor system of this embodiment will be described with reference to the timing charts of Figs. 9A to 11T. At first a read cycle starting from an even address will be described with reference to Figs. 9A to 9T. The clock signal CLK basically consists of clock pulses T1, T2, T3 and T4. When the microprocessor 11 is held in the wait state, the clock signal CLK is represented by TW. When the microprocessor 11 executes the word transfer instruction, it supplies the status The drivers 71 and 73 are operated to supply data from the memories and or I Os 16 and 17 to the microprocessor 11. However, when the detector 19 detects, in accordance with the read write control signal and the address, that the instruction is an instruction for the 8 bit memory and or I O 17, the detector 19 supplies the DET signal to the controller 21. The controller 21 then supplies the signal A write cycle starting with an even address will be described with reference to Figs. 10A to 10T. In this case, the clock signal CLK, the data A read cycle starting with an odd address will be described. In this case, the clock signal CLK, the data STS1, the control signal COM EN The output CYC from the counter 20 can be omitted when the controller 21 performs sequential operation. When a read write word transfer instruction is performed for the memory and or I O 16 having the 16 bit data bus width, the operation is performed at timings as shown in Figs. 2A to 2E. The mode of operation of the microprocessor will be described when the word transfer instruction starting from the even address is performed and automatically converted to two byte transfer instructions. In this case, the microprocessor 11 comprises a 8086 available from Intel Corp. The latch 72 in the converter 15 can be omitted. A portion for controlling the latch 72 can also be omitted from the controller 21. The address latch counter 13 can be simplified, as shown in Fig. 12. The counter 13 comprises a latch 81 and a gate 82. The latch 81 latches the address from the microprocessor 11 and supplies the least significant bit thereof to the controller 21 and the gate 82. The remaining bits of the address are sent from the latch 81 onto an address bus ADDR 19 1. The gate 82 calculates a logical OR of the output from the latch 81 and the logic 1 from the controller 21, and generates the sum as the least significant bit of the address data. All bits of the address signal appear on the address bus ADDR and are supplied to the memories and or I Os 16 and 17. The timing charts of this microprocessor system are the same as those of the word transfer instruction starting with an even address in Figs. 9A to 10T. The present invention is exemplified by a microprocessor system configured by connecting an 8 bit memory and or I O to a 16 bit microprocessor. However, when the address and data buses of the microprocessor system are expanded, a 16 bit memory and or I O may be connected to a 32 bit microprocessor, or a 32 bit memory and or I O may be connected to a 64 bit microprocessor.
