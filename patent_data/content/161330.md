# Chip presteaming and air washing.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are provided for effecting presteaming and deaeration of wood chips, or like com minuted cellulosic fibrous material. Presteaming takes place in a vertical presteaming vessel 10 , utilizing a plurality of uniformly radially spaced nozzles 17 28 adjacent the bottom of the vessel, a plurality of generally uniformly radially spaced steam introduction pipes 31 38 in a central portion 29 of the vessel, and a pair of synchronized rotating valves 45, 46 for feeding steam to the introduction nozzles and pipes in a coordinated manner. After presteaming, the chips pass through a chips meter 59 to a vertical chute 58 in which they are entrained in liquid, and then pass to a horizontal deaerating vessel 12 . In the deaerating vessel, deaerated liquid is passed in a path generally perpendicular to the path defined by 76 80 of the material flowing through the deaeration vessel. The deaerated material discharged from the deaeration vessel passes through a vertical chute 73 to a conventional high pressure feeder 14 , and then is subsequently passed to the top of a continuous digester 13 .
