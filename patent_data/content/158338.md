# Perpendicular magnetic recording medium.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a perpendicular magnetic recording medium wherein an under layer 2 made of a material containing Si and or Ge as its principal ingredient is depo sited on a substrate 1 , and a perpendicular magnetic film 3 made of a Co based alloy is deposited on the under layer. With the perpendicular magnetic recording medium, the perpendicular magnetic film has an enhanced degree of C axis orientation, and the bond strength between the perpendicular magnetic film and the substrate is also enhanced when the substrate is non metallic.
