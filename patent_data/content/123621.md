# Faraday rotator assembly.

## Abstract
A Faraday rotator assembly comprising a Faraday rotator 1 consisting of an optically transparent magnetic material a device 2 for applying a first magnetic field to the Faraday rotator, which field saturates the Faraday rotator with revers able magnetization and a device 22 for applying a second magnetic field to the Faraday rotator, the field having a direc tion different from that of the device for applying the first magnetic field to the Faraday rotator. The magnetization in the Faraday rotator is maintained in a saturation state by the second magnetic field at least during the reversal of the direc tion of the magnetic field. The angle of the Faraday rotation of the Faraday rotator is reversed by reversing the direction of the first magnetic field.
