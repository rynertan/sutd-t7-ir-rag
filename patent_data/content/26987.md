## Description
Polymerisation Catalysts This invention relates to metal compositions in which an organometallic compound and a transition metal organometallic compound are chemically bonded to a substantially inert matrix material, and to processes for the polymerisation of olefinically unsaturated monomers using such compositions as initiators. Transition metal compositions in which an organo metallic compound of a transition metal of Groups IVA toVIA of the Periodic Table of Elements is chemically bonded to a substantially inert matrix material are described and claimed in our British Patent No 1,314,828. Further in our British Patent No 1,475,184 there is described a process for the polymerisation of ethylene and propylene and the copolymerisation of ethylene with mono a olefins, especially butene l and hexene l, using a catalyst comprising a Group IVA transition metal hydrocarbyl compound supported on particulate alumina in which the group IVA metal compound is of a very high degree of purity, so as to increase the degree of incorporation of the said other olefin in the product copolyr r. The Group IVA metal hydrocarbyl compounds useful in the practice of the invention claimed in British Patent Nos.1,314,828 and 1,475,184 are commonly produced by reacting a Group IVA metal compound, e.g. the halide, with a hydrocarbyl compound of a Group I to III metal. The term very high degree of purity means that the ratio of the amount of Group IVA metal to the amount of GroupI to III metal in Group IVA metal hydrocarbyl compounds is at least 100 1, each expressed in gram atoms. US Patent 3,635,935 Hercules Incorporated claims a process for polymerising ethylene which comprises contacting ethylene with a catalyst comprising a a tetra aralkyl titanium compound extended on a silica support in a ratio from about 0.01 to about 0.4 millimole of said titanium compound per gram of silica and b an organoaluminium compound, the molar ratio of the organoaluminium compound to the titanium compound being within the range of from about 1 1 to about 100 1.The preferred organoaluminium compounds are dialkylaluminium chlorides, for example diethylaluminium chloride.The use of supports other than silica are described, for example alumina and silica alumina. We have now found that when the matrix material is reacted with 1 a Group IIIB metal hydrocarbyl compound and 2 a zirconium or hafnium hydrocarbyl compound stable chemical entities are produced which may be used as initiators for the polymerisation of olefinically unsaturated monomers and certain of which have higher activities than the corresponding Group IVA transition metal compositions disclosed in British Patent No.1,314,828 and the compositions described in US Patent 3,635,935. Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention provides a metal composition which is the product of reacting a particulate support material, preferably having a reactive surface as hereinafter defined which is free from water with an organometallic compound of the general formula EMI3.1 and an organometallic compound of the general formula EMI3.2 wherein M is a metal of Group IIIB of the PeriodicTable, R1 and R2 are hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl groups, X, when present, is a singly charged anionic ligand, or a monodentate ligand, and p is 0, 1 or 2. All references to the Periodic Table are to the version of the Periodic Table of the Elements shown in Advanced Inorganic Chemistry by F A Cotton andG Wilkinson, 3rd Edition, Interscience Publishers 1976. Hydrocarbyl groups of different types may be associated with a single metal atom. The hydrocarbyl group R1 preferably is an alkyl group containing less than 20 carbon atoms and more preferably an alkyl group containing 2 to 8 carbon atoms. The metal M is preferably aluminium. A preferred class of Group IIIB metal hydrocarbyl compounds are those which are soluble in a liquid hydrocarbon, e.g. toluene, hexane. Examples of Group IIIB metal hydrocarbyl compounds include aluminium triethyl and aluminium tributyl. The monovalent ligand x, where it is present, is preferably a halogen. Suitable hydrocarbyl groups R2 include straighT chain and cyclic alkyl groups and substituted derivati thereof and alkenyl groups including 8 alkenyl groups such as w allyl and substituted derivatives thereof e.g. tetrakis allyl zirconium or hafnium, tetrakis s methyl allyl zirconium or hafnium and zirconium tris n allyl bromide . The hydrocarbyl group R2 is preferably a substituted alkyl group of general formula EMI4.1 which is a bonded to the zirconium or hafnium through the carbon atom as indicated. Preferably all the groupsR2 have general formula III, but it is possible for some of them to comprise other hydrocarbyl groups. Suitable substituent groups Y include aromatic and polyaromatic groups such as phenyl and naphthyl, giving rise in general formula III to alkaryl ligands benzyl and l methylene l naphthyl and ring substituted derivatives thereof, for example p methyl benzyl. Y may also be a cycloalkenyl group, such as a cyclo octenyl group. Y may also comprise a group of general formula EMI4.2 where Z represents carbon, silicon, germanium tin or lead and R3 which may be the same or different, represents a hydrocarbyl group, for example alkyl especially methyl or aryl especially phenyl . The group R3 3 of formula IV preferably contains a mixture of alkyl especially methyl and aryl especially phenyl groups, for example when R3 3 is dimethylphenyl. Examples of this preferred class of organometallic compounds R4êZrXp and R4êHfXp include zirconium and 4 p hafnium tetra benzyl , zirconium tetrakis p methyl benzyl , zirconium and hafnium tetrakis l methylene lnaphthyl , zirconium tetrakis trimethylsilylmethylene , zirconium tetrakis neopentyl and zirconium tetrakis neophyl . Examples of preferred organometallic compounds R2ZrX and R2HfX , containing monovalent ligands X include 4 p 4 p tris s allyl zirconium chloride, bromide or iodide and the equivalent ir methylallyl and benzyl compounds. By 1reactive surface we mean a plurality of sites on, and preferably attached to, the surface of the substantially inert particulate support material, which sites are capable of abstracting, e.g. a magnesium hydrocarbyl from a solution thereof. Preferably the said sites are OH groups chemically bonded to the surface of the particulate support material and the particulate support material is an inorganic material. Where surfaceOH groups are present they are capable of acting as a proton source, that is they have an acidic function. Such a material will be substantially inert in that, whereas the said OH groups are capable of reacting with, say, the Group IIIB metal organometallic compounds and the zirconium or hafnium organometallic compounds, the bulk of the support material is chemically inert.Particularly good examples of such support materials are silica and alumina or mixtures thereof. These comprise a matrix of silicon or aluminium and oxygen atoms, to the surface of which OH groups are attached, the hydrogen atoms of said groups having an acidic function. However, apart from the presence of these OH groups, silica and alumina are generally regarded as chemically inert. Within the terms silica and alumina we include silica and alumina based materials containing small amounts of other suitable inorganic oxides, such as magnesium oxide and zinc oxide. The preferred matrix is alumina. It is essential that the support material is freed from adsorbed water, as this would merely react with and destroy the Group IIIB, zirconium or hafnium organometallic compounds. The support materials may be readily freed from such adsorbed water by, for example a simple thermal treatment. The reaction between the support material andGroup IIIB metal organometallic compound or zirconium or hafnium organometallic compound comprises displacement of one or more of the hydrocarbyl groups by the hydrogen atom of an OH group or groups of the support material, with liberation of the corresponding free hydrocarbon.When the organometallic compounds are added consecutively and the support material has reacted with the first of the organometallic compounds, it is important that there should be sufficient residual hydroxylic groups for the subsequent reaction with the other organometallic compound. When the zirconium or hafnium organometallic compounds are reacted, all except one of the hydrocarbyl groups of the organometallic compound may be displaced by OH groups of the support material, so that there is at least always one hydrocarbyl group attached to the transition metal in the product. This appears to be independent of the number of reactable hydroxylic groups present on the surface of the support material. The number of reactable hydroxylic groups, that is, the number available for reaction with Group IIIB organometallic compounds and zirconium or hafnium organometallic compounds will depend on the nature and condition of the support material. For example, in some materials, because of their molecular configuration, some of the hydroxylic groups present are not reactive under our conditions. The progress of the reaction with the Group IIIB metal organometallic compound is most conveniently followed by analysis of the supernatant solutions.Reaction of the group IVA transition metal organometallic compounds occurs in substantially the same way as disclosed in our British Patent No 1,314,828. The number of reactive hydroxylic groups present in a given weight of support material will depend upon its nature for example, whether it is silica or alumina and its condition for example, its surface area and the treatment it has received to remove adsorbed water .Thus the precise composition of metal compositions according to our invention may vary from one batch or sample to another of the same support material but successive portions of the same material prepared under identical conditions will give products having the same composition. The ratio of gram atoms of Group IIIB metal to gram atoms of zirconium or hafnium in the metal compositions of the present invention may be varied within wide limits. Typically the ratio is between 0.05 1 and 100 1, preferably 0.1 1 to 25 1, although higher ratios are not deleterious to catalytic activity. The proportion of zirconium or hafnium organometallic compound in the metal compositions of the present invention is suitably in the range 0.01 to 1.0 millimole g, and preferably in the range 0.05 to 0.5 millimole g. The group IIIB metal organometallic compound may be reacted with the matrix before, at the same time as, or after the reaction of the zirconium or hafnium organometallic compound with the matrix. Compositions according to the present invention may be prepared by first contacting a solution of theGroup IIIs metal organometallic compound or zirconium or hafnium organometallic compound with a suitable support material, in the absence of free or adsorbed water. The solvents used for the compounds should be dry and inert hydrocarbon solvents are preferred. The support is then contacted with the other organometallic compound.Alternatively the compounds may be added concurrently.Most preferably the zirconium or hafnium organometallic compound is reacted with the support material before adding the Group IIIB organometallic compound when theGroup III organometallic compound is an aluminium hydrocarbyl in which the hydrocarbyl group contains four carbon atoms or more. Since many of the zirconium and hafnium organometallic compounds which may be used in our process are thermally unstable, the reaction temperature in this stage of the process must be maintained low enough to avoid decomposition of the compounds. With some compounds, temperatures below OOC are required. An alternative method for preparing metal compositions according to our invention comprises, first, adding excess of either Group IVA transition metal organometallic compound e.g. titanium, zirconium or hafnium hydrocarbyl compound or a Grignard reagent magnesium hydrocarbyl compound to a sample of the support material, determining the number of molecules of hydrocarbon liberated, and then adding to a further sample of the support material Group IIIB metal organometallic compound and zirconium or hafnium organometallic compound which in combination are up to the amount required to liberate an equivalent amount of hydrocarbon. For example, a sample of the support material may be suspended in a solvent and excess of a Group IVA transition metal benzyl added. The amount of toluene produced is measured and related to the weight of support material.A second sample of the support material is then taken and a zirconium of hafnium hydrocarbyl is added, followed by a Group IIIB metal hydrocarbyl. The compositions defined above can be used as initiators for the polymerisation of olefinically unsaturated monomers. In this specification we intend the term polymerisation to mean the formation of high molecular weight polymers and we also intend the term to exclude oligomerisation to low molecular weight materials. According to a second aspect of the present invention olefinically unsaturated monomers are polymerised by means of an initiator which comprises a metal composition which is the product of reacting a particulate support material, preferably having a reactive surface as hereinbefore defined which is free from water with an organometallic compound of the general formula EMI9.1 and an organometallic compound of the general formula EMI9.2 wherein M is a metal of Group IIIB of the PeriodicTable, R1 and R2 are hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl groups as hereinbefore defined, X, when present, is a singly charged anionic ligand or monodentate ligand as hereinbefore defined, and p is 0, 1 or 2. The term olefinically unsaturated monomer is intended to include mono olefins such as ethylene, propylene and 4 methylpentene l. Our compositions may also be used to initiate the copolymerisation of two or more olefinioally unsaturated monomers. For example, ethylene may be copolymerised with propylene, butene, hexene or decene, butadiene or styrene. Polymerisation processes according to our invention may be carried out by techniques generally used for free radical initiated polymerisation or for polymerisation processes of the type using Ziegler catalysts. The choice of conditions of pressure and temperature will vary with factors such as the nature of the monomer and initiator, and whether liquid, e.g. bulk or diluent, or gas phase polymerisation is used. For example, when ethylene is polymerised, pressures from sub atmospheric to several thousand atmospheres may be used. Low pressure, say from 0.1 to 30 atmospheres and intermediate pressure say from 30 to 300 atmospheres polymerisations may be carried out using conventional equipment but very high pressure polymerisation must be performed using suitable specialised reactors and pumping equipment. However, since, generally speaking, the higher the pressure the higher the activity, the use of such techniques may be justified.If very high pressures are used, it is preferred that conditions are such that the ethylene feed and polyethylene produced are maintained in a single fluid phase, i.e.the pressure should exceed 500 Kg cm2, preferably 1000 to 3000 Kg cmê and the temperature should be greater than 125 C, say 140 300 C. This type of process is usually operated in a continuous manner. A wide range of temperatures may be used, but in general low and intermediate pressure ethylene polymerisations are carried out at temperatures in the range 50 lEO0C. When the process of our invention is used to polymerise propylene, it is preferred to operate under conditions commonly used for the polymerisation of propylene. However, polymerisation of propylene under other conditions e.g. high pressure, is not excluded. It is also within the scope of our invention to use our compositions to initiate the copolymerisation of ethylene and propylene together and or with other olefinically unsaturated monomers. The polymerisation process of the present invention may be carried out in the liquid or gaseous phase i.e. in the essential absence of aliquid medium and preferably in the gaseous phase. Where polymerisation is effected in the liquid phase, and the monomer is not liquid under the polymerisation conditions, the monomer may be dissolved in a suitable solvent. Examples of suitable solvents are aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons for instance pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, decane, benzene, toluene and mixtures thereof. Polymerisation may be effected either in a batch manner or on a continuous basis. Preferably, however, the polymerisation process of the present invention is effected as a continuous gas phase process such as a fluid bed process. A fluid bed reactor for use in the process of the present invention typically comprises a reaction zone and a so called velocity reduction zone.The reaction zone comprises a bed of growing polymer particles, formed polymer particles and a minor amount of initiator particles fluidised by the continuous flow of the gaseous monomer, and gaseous diluent to remove heat of polymerisation through the reaction zone. A suitable rate of gas flow may be readily determined by simple experiment. Make up of gaseous monomer to the circulating gas stream is at a rate equal to the rate at which particulate polymer product is withdrawn from the reactor and the composition of the gas passing through the reactor is adjusted to maintain an essentially steady state gaseous composition within the reaction zone. The gas leaving the reactior Dne is passed to the velocity reduction zone where entrained particles are removed.Finer entrained particles and dust may be removed in a cyclone and or fine filter.The said gas is compressed in a compressor and passed through a heat exchanger wherein it is stripped of the heat of polymerisation and then returned to the reaction zone. Chain transfer agents may be used in a polymerisation process according to our invention, and when ethylene is polymerised their use is normally desirable as the polyethylene produced is of very high molecular weight. Hydrogen may be conveniently used in accordance with usual practice. However, some solvents may act as chain transfer agents. Our process is preferably effected under an atmosphere free of oxygen, for example under an atmosphere of an inert gas, e.g. nitrogen, or of theemonomer to be polymerised. It is also preferred to effect the process using apparatus and solvents which have been carefully freed from impurities, such as oxygen, water and other substances which would otherwise react with the initiators. The invention is illustrated by the followingExamples. In the examples iso octane was purified by passage through R3 ll copper catalyst and 5A molecular sieve and finally by sparging with pure nitrogen immediately before use. Ethylene was purified by passage through R3 ll copper catalyst and 5A molecular sieve.Example 1A particulate support material, KETJEN Registered TradeMark Grade B alumina supplied by Koninklijke Zwavelzurfabricken v L Ketjen N.V. was dried and converted to the gamma phase by heating at 5000C for 2 hours under a flow of dry nitrogen. 18.66 g of the alumina was slurried in 100 ml toluene in an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. 13 ml of a 0.5 M solution of triethyl aluminium in hexane was added dropwise with vigorous stirring over 10 minutes.
