# Method and apparatus for determination of an analyte and method of calibrating such apparatus.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are described for the determi nation of an analyte in an aqueous liquid which eliminate the biasing effect of unknown interferents which are either preformed or formed in situ during the determination. The method comprises physically contacting a sample of the liquid with an interactive composition for the analyte, measuring the spectrophotometric responses generated by such contact at a primary wavelength λ₁ and one or more secondary wavelengths λ₂,λ₃, ...λ
