The lid is a one piece plastics moulding and the skirt is formed with a cylindrical part 31 adjacent the flange for form ing a first seal with the lip 22 . A resiliently flexible free end part of the skirt has a frusto conical surface 36 , which en gages with the inner end 25 of the lip to define a second seal, spaced from the first seal. Recesses 17 are provided at the radially outer edge of the surface 36 , to permit air to escape, as the skirt slides down the lip 22 during fitting of the lid in the container.
