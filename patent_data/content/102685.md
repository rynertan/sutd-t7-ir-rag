# Blood vessel catheter for medicine delivery and method of manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
A catheter which is capable of delivering medicine into a blood vessel at a selected point, such as into a coronary artery, includes an outer tube and an inner tube. A distal portion of the outer tube extends beyond the distal end of the inner tube, and the outer tube is formed from a polymeric material having a substantially lower flexural modulus than the polymeric material of the inner tube so that the distal portion is relatively flexible for enabling insertion in a tortuous blood vessel. The inner diameters of the inner tube and the distal portion of the outer tube permit insertion of a guide wire therethrough for aiding in the insertion of the catheter.
