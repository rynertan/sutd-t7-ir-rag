# Thin film optical variable article having substantial color shift with angle and method.

## Abstract
Thin film optical variable article having substantial color shift with varying angle of light incidence and viewing including an optically thick, substantially transparent ele ment 12 carrying a colorant and having first and second surfaces 14, 16 . A multilayer interference coating 17 is carried on one 14 of said first and second surfaces. The colorant serves to modify in essentially a subtractive mode the color at normal incidence and the color shift with angle of the multilayer interference coating as seen by reflection or transmission.
