## Description
X ray apparatus using dummy image subtraction. The invention relates to an X ray apparatus comprising anX ray source and an , ray dete ctor for generating and detecting radiation images produced by interaction between an X ray beam and an object to be examined, and also comprising an imaging device for the formation of images to be displayed. The invention also relates to a method of performing X ray exarainations by means of such an apparatus. An X ray apparatus of the kind seth forth is known from an article entitled Digital Radiography in Computer Tonographie 1, Vol. 3, t Lrch 1983, pp 1 10. This articles describes various X ray examination r.lethods utilizing digital image processing. A very useful method is described on the pages 7 and 8 of said article. This method utilizes anX ray apparatus comprising an X ray image intensifier television chain as a detection system which is suitable for digital image processing. tls.Ps. 4,204,225 discloses an X ray apparatus comprising such a detection system and a digital image subtraction device for images of the same object or part of the object but recorded before and after injection of a contrast medium. A striking aspect thereof is that in comparison with other imaging methods substantially artefact free images are obtained. The invention is based on the recognition of the fact that the majority of artefacts are eliminated by the subtraction operation, because all apparatus induced artefacts which are equally present in both images are eliminated from the ultir.late image. It is the object of the invention to achieve this advantage also for other X ray apparatus and examination methods to this end, anX ray apparatus of the kind set forth in accordance with the invention is characterized in that for the reduction of apparatus induced artefacts in the images to be displayed it fonts a dummy image which is to be used for subtraction at a later stage and which contains the same apparatus induced artefacts as an object image forned with at least substantially the same imaging parameters. Because an X ray apparatus in accordance with the invention utilizes subtraction images for the ultimate image formation, all artefacts introduced by the apparatus are eliminated fraa the ultimate ir.zage. Comparatively difficult problems concerning the superposition of a dummy image and an image of the object to be examined can be avoided by constructing a dummy object so that it exhibits an at least subs can tially hcnogeneous interaction at least for a relevant section of theX ray beam.It may be advantageous to make the interaction between theX ray beam and the durmn object approximately equal on average to the interaction between the X ray beam and thP object to be examined. The subtraction is optimized by utilizing image digitization and digital subtraction The digital image processing is then preferably logarithmically performed. For example, for diagnostic imaging in a variety ofX ray apparatus artefact free images can thus be obtained by means of the device disclosed in US.PS. 4,204,225 without image subtraction in the sense as described therein.Use if preferably made of an X ray image intensifier tube as described in US.PS. 4,213,055 and a television camera tube as described in US.PS. 3,831,058. For applications requiring exact positioning or repositioning of the durry object or the object to be examined, use can be made of the apparatus described in GB 2,098,440 PHN 10043 . The duintry image can be adapted to the nature of the X rays, the shape and the properties of the detector, the object or part of the object to be examined, the geometry of the beam path, etc. For examinations involving X rays of different hardness so called dual energy examinations , use can be made of anX ray generator with a number of fixed excitation pulses for the X ray tube aSich can be preset as regards voltage and pulse duration. An adapted dummy object can be used for each of the wavelength ranges of theX ray beam.For automatic exposure control, use can be made of a phototimer, for example as described in US.PS. 3,546,461 in order to correlate the exposure for a dunny image and an object image. For the recording of image information to be processed at a later stage, a digital magnetic recording device may be included. One or msre dummy images can be stored in such a recording device, also for a prolonged period of time and in such a manner that they can be fetched time and again. Such dumay images require adaptation only when a different te of examination is to be peftorn d or when the imaging quality of the apparatus has changed. Moreover, in the latter case information as regards the nature and the extent of such a change can be derived by subtraction of an earlier and a later dunny image.This information will usually suffice for locating and el mi nating such changes Dunny images of this kind can also be used for testing the quality of theX ray apparatus, for example, they can be sent to the manufacturer of the apparatus for comparison. The invention involves the formation of an object image as well as a dummy image, all circumstances remaining the same as all as possible for both image formations the dummy image is adapted to the degree and nature of the interaction between the X ray beam and the object to be examined. The t D images thus formed are subsequently subjected to a subtraction operation. Subtraction is preferably digitized.For brief or prolonged image storage use can be made of digital magnetic image recording. Some preferred embodiments in accordance with the invention will be described in detail hereinafter with reference to the accompanying dia grammatic drawing. An X ray apparatus as shown in the sole Figure of the drawing comprises an X ray tube 1 which comprises an anode 2, a cathode 4 and an exit window 6 for an X ray beam 8 for irradiating an object 10 which is arranged on an object table 12. Underneath the object table viewed in the Figure and in the X ray beam 14 carrying image information there is arranged an X ray image intensifier tube 15 which com prises an entrance screen 16, an exit screen 18 and an electronoptical system 20 which images an electron beam 22 on the exit screen, said electron beam being released from a photocathode of the entrance screen by the X ray beam 14.Using an optical fibre system or, as in this case a lens system 24, the exit screen 18 is optically coupled to an entrance screen 26 of a television camera tube 25. In the television camera tube an image which is projected onto its entrance screen 26 by a light beam 27 is scanned by an electron beam 28 in order to be converted into a video signal. Via a preamplifier 30, the video signal is applied to a first monitor 32 and an A D converter 34 in which analog video signals are converted into digitized image signals which can be applied for further processing to a digital image recording device 36 which comprises a digital image prccessing unit 38,a first image storage device 40, for example a magnetic disc, and a second memory 42, for example a digital optical memory in which images can be stored for prolonged periods of tine. From the memory arithmetic unit a resultant digital image can be displayed on a television monitor 46 via a D A converter 46 or be recorded as a hardcopy via a hardcopy unit 48.A central control unit 50 is provided for control and, if necessary, synchronisation of the television camera tube, the X ray tube and the position or the Object table and hence of the object. For the execution of the method in accordance with the inven tion, being parallel to the method disclosed in US.PS. 4,204,226 to a high degree, a dunny image is made, for example of a dummy object cons is ting of a plate of a material whose absorption is approximately equal and equivalent to the mean absorption of an object to be examined. To this end, use can be made of a material having an absorption coefficient which is at least substantially equal to that of the object to be examined, so in the case of diagnostic examination a material whose ab sorption coefficient corresponds to that of biological tissues or bones etc.The degree of absorption can be adapted by selection of the thickness of the dunny object, viewed in the direction of the radiation. For the geometry and the radiation properties of the dummy object it is also possible to take into accour.t the radiation quality of the X rays to be used, for equal hardening of the radiation etc., the geometry of the radiation beam, so the mutual positions of the radiation object point, the object and the detection entrance screen, notably for uni ty in imaging and scattered radiation, beam stopping, and the cross section of the X ray beam to be used, as well as as has already been stated the geometry and the nature of the object or series of objects to be examined The circumstances being the same as well as possible, at least for the apparatus as such, a duir liflage is formed as well as an object image, after which a subtraction image is formed using the method described in US.OS. 4,204,226. However, this subtraction image is no an object image wherefrom all apparatus induced artefacts have been removed. If desired, the dunny image and the object image may be stored for a short or long period of time in a in this case digital memory.Though the digital subtraction offers rrany advantages, the inventIon need not be restricted thereto. The advantages of the inve tion can also be achieved by means of analog, for example video signal subtraction and optical subtraction of, for example, cinematographic images. The suzer position problems encountered in customary non digital image sub traction are here irrelevant thanks to the hcmogenous transmission of the dunny object. For other examinations a new dummy image can be formed as de sired, said new dummy image taking the place of the previously formed dunny image or being stored in a memory. It is also possible to deliver with an X ray apparatus a set of identified dunny images which can be fetched, for example, from a digital or analog memory. By subtraction of an earlier and a later dunny image of, for example the same dunny object, changes in the imaging quality of the apparatus in the course of its service life can be demonstrated and usually their nature and cause can be identified. After such a test, either the later dunny image can be used or the apparatus can be repaired. A further type of X ray apparatus in which the invention can be successfully used is the type described with reference to Figure 16 of said article Digital Radiography . Therein notably any inhomogenities of the luminescent screen are completely removed from the ultimate diagnostic image by subtraction of a dunny image. Merely an image subtraction unit comprising a memory need then be added to the digital image processing device included in the described apparatus. Also for dual energy X ray examination methods improved ultimate images can be obtained by means of the invention. It is notably advantageous to form an adapted dunny image for each of the X ray wavelength ranges to be used. Deviations in the imaging properties of the apparatus due to the difference in hardness of the X rays are thus eliminated from the ultimate images. The only difference then remaining bet . sen two ultimate images recorded with X rays of different hardness is then the interaction differences between the X ray beam and the object to be examined, so that a better diagnosis is possible. Because the diagnostic ultimate images obtained by means of the method in accordance with the invention are substantially free from the image artefacts customarily occurring, a smaller radiation dose will usually suffice for the formation of the object image, so that a patient to be examined will be exposed to a smaller radiation load.
