# Machine for lasting heel seat portions of shoes.

## Abstract
In tack seat lasting machines, operator skill is often required because of irregularities in last manufacture, especially in drilling the last pin hole. Thus automatic presentation is difficult. In accordance with the invention the last pin 32 min is mounted for limited rocking movement about an axis extending lengthwise of the shoe bottom, and shoe centralising means 424 engages edges of the shoe, at opposite sides of the last pin, to ensure alignment with a longitudinal centre line of the machine. Furthermore, the rocking axis can be adjusted angularly, about a heightwise axis, to locate it substantially in the heel to toe plane of the shoe. The centralised shoe is then clamped by a holddown 406 , the centralising means released, and the shoe heel end clamped by a heel band 520 which, by equalised pressure being applied to both legs thereof, holds the shoe in position as presented.

## Description
Machine for lasting heel seat portions of shoes This invention is concerned with machines for lasting heel seat portions of shoes comprising a shoe support, for supporting, bottom uppermost, a shoe comprising an upper positioned on a last and an insole on the last bottom, said support comprising heel support means including a last pin which can be received in a hole therefor formed in the heel end of the last, and a toe support member, which can be positioned widthwise of the machine according to whether the shoe is a left or a right, holddown means between which end the shoe support heightwise relative movement can take place, whereby the heightwise position of the shoe bottom can be set by engagement of the heel seat region thereof with said holddown means, a heel band arrangement, between which and the shoe support relative movement can take place lengthwise of the shoe bottom, to cause the heel end of the shoe to be clamped, and heel seat lasting instrumentalities, including wiper plates movable in a wiping plane, whereby lasting marginal portions of the upper can be wiped over and pressed against corresponding marginal portion of the insole. One such machine is described in UK patent specification No. 8020133, in which machine shoes are loaded onto the shoe support by hand, the operator holding the shoe in a desired orientation, both in relation to a longitudinal centre line of the lasting instrumentalities and also in relation to said wiping plane, until the shoe is clamped in such position by the holddown means and the heel band arrangement. When, on the other hand, it is a question of automatic presentation, a problem frequently arises where the shoe support comprises a last pin for supporting the last, because the hole formed in the heel end of the last for receiving the last pin is often carelessly drilled, with a result that it is either not arranged with its longitudinal axis normal to the surface of the cone of the last, or is not positioned centrally of the cone, or both. Thus, in the case of automatic presentation, where location of the shoe relies solely on the position of the last pin hole, misalignment of the shoe with the heel seat lasting instrumentalities often arises in the manually fed machines, of course, this can be readily corrected for by the operator presenting the shoe. For assisting the operator, furthermore, it has been proposed in a number of cases, for overcoming this particular problem, to enable the last pin to rock about an axis extending lenthwise of the shoe bottom in order to facilitate the orientation of the shoe by the operator as he presents it to the heel seat last instrumentalities.Such an arrangement in itself, however, is not satisfactory alone where the shoe is to be presented automatically. It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide an improved heel seat lasting machine in which shoes can be reliably presented automatically to the heel seat lasting instrumentalities. This object is resolved in accordance with the invention in that the last pin is mounted for limited rocking movement about an axis extending lengthwise of the shoe bottom, and in that shoe centralising means is provided comprising two shoe engaging elements, arranged at opposite sides of the last pin, and means for moving them, through equal distances, to engage the shoe supported by said last pin. sing this arrangement, it will be seen that, regardless of the last pin hole position, the heel seat of the shoe can be accurately oriented in relation to the longitudinal centre line of the machine and the wiping plane. Furthermore, the invention is especially, but not exclusively, suited to a machine as described in the aforementioned specification, wherein the heel band arrangement is such that, by equalised pressure being applied to the legs of the heel band, the shoe is clamped substantially in the position in which it is presented to the heel band arrangement, thereby ensuring that the orientation of the shoe, as determined by the operation of the shoe centralising means as aforesaid, is maintained when the shoe is clamped in the machine. Conveniently, the shoe centralising means is supported by a carriage by which also the heel band arrangement and the heel seat lasting instrumentalities are supported, the arrangement being such that relative movement is effected between the heel band arrangement and the shoe support only after the holddown means is operative and the shoe centralising means has then been rendered inoperative.In this way, it will be appreciated, once the shoe has been centralised and its position established by the operation of the holddown means, the shoe centralising means can be moved to an out of the way position, in which it will not interfere with the further operation of the machine, and this is readily achieved in accordance with the invention by mounting the centralising means on said carriage. The axis about which the last pin can rock as aforesaid may be aligned with the longitudinal centre line of the heel seat lasting instrumentalities. Where, however, the toe end of the shoe bttom is significantly offset from the longitudinal centre line of the heel end portion of the shoe bottom, and thus the toe support means of the shoe support is significantly offset from the longitudinal centre line of the machine, the support for the shoe may become unstable.This instability is believed to arise primarily because of the lack of symmetry of the last about its heelto toe plane, in combination with the bulk of the material of the last being disposed about the rocking axis of the last pin, with the result that the last pin is urged by the bulk of the last to rock about its axis, this rocking being such that the less bulky portion of the last, on the opposite side of the heel to toe plane, tends to lift off the toe support means. At the same time, rocking of the last in an opposite direction, which may be desirable in order to orient correctly the shoe bottom in the plane of the heel seat lasting instrumentalities, is strongly opposed because of the relationship between the rocking axis of the last pin and the heel to toe plane of the last. With a view to overcoming this problem, in accordance with the further feature of the present invention, the last pin is mounted on a support member for rocking movement as aforesaid, said member being itself mounted for movement about an axis extending heightwise of the shoe bottom.By thus aligning the rocking axis of the last pin in the heel to toe plane of the shoe, the tendency of the, shoe to rock in an undesirable manner as above described is resisted, while limited rocking in both directions about the rocking axis, for purposes of orienting the shoe bottom to the heel seat lasting instrumentalities, is permitted. For securing the support member in adjusted position as aforesaid, locating means may be provided, comprising a locating pin engageable in one or more recesses provided therefor, the pin being inserted by the operator after he has positioned the support member in a desired position. Alternatively, the locating pin may comprise a spring urged detent, which yields as the operator rotates the support member. Again, clamping means may be provided for clamping the support member after it has been positioned as aforesaid. In one embodiment of the invention, the last pin is carried by a support block supported by the support member inter engaging faces of said block and member being arcuate, the centre of curvature thereof extending widthwise of the shoe bottom, and locking means being provided for holding the block in adjusted position on the member. Such adjustment of the support block assists in setting the heel to toe orientation of the shoe, according to the different styles of shoe to be accommodated, especially taking into account variations in the heel height. Similarly, in one embodiment of the invention the support block supports a cradle for the last pin, said cradle being slidable, widthwise of the shoe bottom, in said block and locking means being provided for locking said cradle in adjusted position. Such setting of the cradle, widthwise of the shoe bottom, serves to compensate for the difference, widthwise of the shoe bottom, between the longitudinal centre line of the cone surface of the last and the longitudinal centre line of the heel seat of the shoe bottom. In order adequately to support the last on the last pin, furthermore, preferably a last support plate is provided on the shoe support, the under side of said plate and a co operating surface of a mounting for the last pin being complementarily part spherical. Furthermore, the last support plate is preferably resiliently held on said mounting. Thus, regardless of the orientation of the last on the shoe support, an overall surface contact can be achieved between the shoe engaging surface of the last support plate and the corresponding last cone surface. There now follows a detailed description, to be read with reference to the accompanying drawings, of one machine in accordance with the invention, which machine has been selected for description by way of nonlimiting example. In the accompanying drawings Figure 1 is a fragmentary left hand side view of the machine in accordance with the invention, showing details of shoe centralising means thereof Figure 2 is a front view, showing details of said shoe centralising means Figure 3 is a fragmentary view partly in section, showing details of heel support means of a shoe support of the machine in accordance with the invention Figure 4 is a diagram of a shoe bottom, indicating the heel to toe plane thereof in relation to a rocking axis of a last pin of the heel support means. The machine in accordance with the invention now to be described is a machine for lasting heel seat portions of shoes using tacks, said machine comprising toe support means not shown and heel support means generally designated 30. The toe support means may be of any conventional design and may comprise a V shaped toe end engaging member 48 see figure 4 and a toe pad not shown which can be urged upwardly against the toe cap portion of a shoe supported by a heel support means 30, thus to set the toe to heel orientation of the shoe bottom. The position of the toe support means, widthwise of the shoe bottom, can be adjusted in a conventional manner to accommodate a left or a right shoe. The heel support means 30 comprises an upstanding sleeve portion 24 carrying at its upper end a threaded collar portion 26 for heightwise adjustment thereon. Projecting from the collar portion 26, and slidable heightwise therein, is a rod 28 carrying a support member 420 Figure 3 accommodated in a bore 28a provided therefor in the rod 28. The support member 420 is thus able to be rotated, about the axis of a spigot 420a and thus about an axis extending heightwise of the shoe bottom, clamping means, in the form of a headed bolt 421, being provided for clamping the support member 420 in adjusted position on the rod 28.The support member 420 has a groove portion in which is accommodated a support block 416, inter engaging faces of the block 416 and support member 420 being curved, and the centre of curvature thereof extending widthwise of the shoe bottom, the block 416 thus being able to slide relative to the support member 420 about said centre of curvature, thus to assist in setting the toe andheel orientation of the shoe. For adjusting the position of the block 416 in the support member 420, and also for clamping it in adjusted position, two locating pins 422 are provided, threadedly secured in the block 416 and engageable each with the head of the clamp bolt 421.The support block 416 in turn is provided with a groove, normal to the groove of the support member 420, for receiving a cradle 414 for sliding movement therein, a locking pin 418 being provided, in the support block 416, for locking the cradle 414 in adjusted position. The position of the cradle 414 can thus be set by the operator in a direction extending widthwise of the shoe bottom. The cradle 414, which is generally Ushaped in end view, supports a pivot pin 412 on which is carried a mounting block 410, itself supporting a last pin 32 , the pin 32 thus being able to rock about the axis of the pin 412 which axis thus constitutes the rocking axis of the last pin . For supporting each last, furthermore, the heel support means 30 also comprises a support plate 442, on which the cone surface of the last rests when a last is placed on the last pin 32 . The support plate 442 has an elongated slot 444 through which the last pin 32 projects, and spring fingers 446 are bolted to opposite sides of the block 410 and engage in grooves 448 formed at opposite sides of the plate 442, to hold it resiliently in position on the block. The under side of the plate 422, furthermore, has a part spherical recess 450 which engages on a complementarily shaped surface 452 of the block 410, so as to enable the plate to be universally movable relative to the last pin 32 . In this way, overall surface engagement can be achieved between the plate 442 and the cone surface of the last. The machine in accordance with the invention also comprises a main frame 360 within which a carriage 362 is mounted, for sliding movement towards and away from a shoe presented thereto on its last support 20, on slide rods 364 carried by said frame, the carriage supporting heel seat lasting instrumentalities generally designated 366, and including wiper plates, fastener driving means associated therewith, and a heel band arrangement not shown . The heel band arrangement is of a type fully described in U.K.Patent Application No. 8020133 wherein the legs of the band are urged inwardly by means of a pressure compensating arrangement so that if one of the legs engages the shoe before the other, it will not dislodge the shoe, but rather its further inward movement will be curtailed and no signi ficant pressure will be applied by it to the shoe until the other leg engages the shoe. In this way, the shoe is clamped by the heel band arrangement in the position in which it has previously been located on the last pin. The machine in accordance with the invention also comprises a holddown member 406 which is arranged to engage with the heel seat of a shoe positioned on the shoe support 20, moveable heightwise of the machine under the action of a piston and cylinder arrangement 398. For supporting the holddown member 406, the machine in accordance with the invention comprises two support arms 386, mounted on the frame 360 and supporting a cross member 388 which carries a shaft 392 connected by a lever 394 to a piston rod 396 of a piston and cylinder arrangement 398, which is carried on the frame 360. Operation of said arrangement 398 thus effects rotation of the shaft 392.The shaft also supports a lever 400 connected to two plates 404 to which the holddown member 406 is bolted, a further lever 408 being connected between the holddown member and the cross member 388, the levers 400, 408 thus forming a parallel linkage arrangement whereby the movement of the holddown member 406 is maintained substantially vertical. The machine in accordance with the invention also comprises shoe centralising means generally designated 423 Fig.2 , comprising two forwardly projecting shoe engaging elements 424, arranged for movement between an operative position, in which they can engage opposite side portions of the heel seat of the shoe, one at either side of the last pin 32 , and an out of the way position. F9r moving the elements 424 as aforesaid, each element is carried on a lever 426, which is supported, at an end remote from the element, on a further lever 428 pivotally mounted on a cross member 430 bolted to the front face of the carriage 362. In addition, pivotally connected to an intermediate portion of each lever 426 is one arm of a bell crank lever 432, pivoted on the cross member 430, the other arm of which is directed inwardly towards a central region of the cross member 430. Each of said other arms carries an abutment which engages with a flange member 434 carried on a piston rod 436 of a piston and cylinder arrangement 438 itself supported on the carriage 362. In addition, springs 440, connected between each lever 428 and the carriage 362, urge the elements 424 into their out of the way position, operation of the piston and cylinder arrangement 438, on the other hand, moving said elements to their operative position.It will thus be appreciated that, because of the arrangement above described, operation of the elements 424 ensures that each moves through the same distance as the other, so that they can effect a centralising action on a shoe presented therebetween. In using the machine in accordance with the invention, the operator locates the rocking axis 412 of the last pin 32 so that it lies substantially in the heelto toe plane of the shoe bottom, said plane of course being determined by the widthwise position of the V shaped toe end engaging member 48 see Figure 4 . Of course, in certain circumstances, the rocking axis of the last pin may well lie along the longitudinal centre line of the heel seat lasting instrumentalities, viz. when the shoe bottom shape is such that the V shaped member 48 is located on said centre line also. It will of course be appreciated that some misalignment between the heel to toe plane of the shoe bottom and the rocking axis 412 of the last pin 32 can be tolerated without going beyond the scope of the present invention. Figure 4 is a diagram of a shoe bottom, showing the heel to toe plane HT of the last bottom, the location of which is determined by the widthwise setting of the toe support means 34 indicated in this Figure by the member 48 and pad 58 . The longitudinal centre line of the heel seat liy is also indicated. Conventionally, using e.g. a heel seat lasting machine, the rocking axis 412 of the heel pin 32 would be aligned with the line HS, so that the last pin would be able to rock in a plane indicated by R HS . With a shoe having a configuration as indicated in Figure 4, however, there would be a tendency for the last to tilt on its support. Thus, in accordance with the invention, the rock ing axis 412 is aligned with the heel to toe plane HT, the rocking plane now being as indicated by R HT . With the rocking axis thus oriented, a shoe can then be located on the last pin,32, with its heel seat region in a desired heightwise position. Thereafter, firstly the shoe centralising means 423 is operated to engage opposite side portions of the shoe, and if necessary, by rocking the last pin 32 about the axis 412, to centralise the heel end region of the shoe with the longitudinal centre line HS of the heel seat aligned with the longitudinal centre line of the machine, regardless of the relationship between the centre line HS and the heel to toe plane Hut of the shoe bottom. With the shoe centralised as aforesaid, the holddown foot 312 is actuated to clamp the shoe on the last pin in a centralised condition, and the elements of the shoe centralising means are then moved to an out of the way position. With the shoe thus held, the carriage 362 is then caused to advance, to bring the heel band 420 into clamping engagement with the heel end of the shoe, the shoe centralising means, which is mounted on the carriage 362, thus being moved out of the way, so as not to impede the side lasting operation. With the shoe clamped by the heel band, the side lasting operation then takes place in a conventional manner.
