## Description
The present invention relates to a device and method for the reduction of static charge buildup in cassettes for housing magnetic recording tape. A non volatile, organic, conductive coating composition is created on the surfaces of components of the cassettes, dramatically reducing static charge buildup within the cassette. The problems of triboelectric charging and other forms of static charge buildup have long provided problems in various commerciaql areas. A large number of various methods have been developed over the years for dealing with this problem. Amongst the various techniques used to reduce electrostatic charge buildup are the application of conductive coatings to surfaces, the inclusion of conductive particulate matter or fibres within the composition, the matching of work functions of surfaces in movable contact with each other, exterior grounding of surfaces subject to charge, and even coating with compositions that suppress spark discharge. Each of these procedures has its own advantages and disadvantages, but are generally regarded in the art as equivalent in their ability to reduce static charge buildup. A prior art that is of interest is US A 4 313 978 that discloses an antistatic composition that may be used to treat the surface of a gramaphone record to reduce static charging thereon. The antistatic composition according to Claim 1 of this prior art document comprises a mixture of This prior art contains the features that are defined in the pre characterizing part of the accompanying Claim 1. In the characterizing part of the accompanying Claim 1 there is the requirement that the antistatic composition of the present invention shall contain polyethylene glycol 200. During the examination stage of this patent it was noted that the antistatic composition of US A 4 313 978 may include a lubricant. Because of this attention is directed to McGraw Hill Encyclopedia of Science Technology, 5th edition 1982, McGraw Hill Book Company New York St. Louis San Francisco Auckland Bogota Guatemala Hamburg Johannesburg Lisbon London Madrid Mexico Montreal New Dehli Panama Paris San Juan Soa Paulo Singapore Sydney Tokyo Toronto, vol. 10 per prog, pages 626 627 that discloses that polyethylene glycol with average molecular weights of 200 to 20,000 can, amongst many other purposes, serve as a lubricant and as an antistatic agent. Finally, attention is directed to Ullmann s Encyklopädie der technischen Chemie, Vol 15, p. 270, Weihan 1978, page 270, bottom left hand column, that states that polyethylene glycol is exclusively an inner antistatic agent, i.e. for internal application, whereas the present invention uses it as an outer antistatic agent, i.e. for external application. The present invention provides for an improved method of reducing electrostatic charge buildup in cassettes which house magnetic recording tape by the creation of a non volatile electrically conductive, organic coating composition on surfaces of the cassettes and the components of the cassette, the method being as defined in the accompanying Claim 1. The invention also includes a cassette as defined in claim 2. The coating composition is preferably applied to all surfaces which do not directly contact the magnetic recording tape during storage or playback mode, although those surfaces may also be coated. The coating composition is a non integral, preferably non film forming composition which is applied to both interior and exterior surfaces and components in the cassette. Magnetic recording tapes are stored in various types of cassettes for their use in various fields within the industry. Magnetic tape containing cassettes are used in computers, in audio recording, audio video recording, typewriting and other information storage and usage mediums. Even within the various fields of use described above, there are different formats in the industry. Cassettes are thus variously available for both 8 track cartridges and cassette audio recording nominally 3.8 mm tape , and both U Matic three quarter inch nominal and VHS and BETA format nominally one half inch tape audio video recording devices. Newer formats, such as the 8 millimeter audio video format, are already being tested and developed. These cassettes have traditionally been plagued with a problem of electrostatic charging during both manufacture and use. During manufacture, the molding and handling operations used to form the various parts of the cassette have caused generation of triboelectric charges within the cassette. When the cassette is then transported to the operating station where the tape is inserted into the cassette, significant problems are often encountered because of the residual or developed charge on the cassettes. Particulate matter, such as dust, is often attracted into the cassette and is also deposited upon the surface of the magnetic tape as it is inserted. The dust causes both aesthetic and functional problems with the use of the tape. During use of cassettes, static charge build up will again attract particulate matter into and onto the cassette. The presence of dust on the tape itself can harm both the tape and the magnetic heads which read the tape. The appearance of dust on the cassette and the tape provides an unattractive and worrisome appearance to the user. As noted above, cassettes presently are made with conductive materials included within the composition used to form the various surfaces and components of the cassettes. This moderately reduces the residual charge which cassettes can maintain, but residual charging in excess of 2000 volts is still quite common. The application, according to the present invention, of a non volatile, conductive, organic coating composition to the surfaces of and the components of a cassette which houses magnetic recording tape has been found to be able to consistently reduce the residual charge in cassettes to less than 500 volts. Generally, electrostatic charging is held to less than 200 or even less than 100 volts in such cassettes. The residual charge is that charge retained on the body after charging of the body and exposure to air at 20 C and 30 percent relative humidity for 20 hours. The conductive coating composition of the present invention has been referred to as non volatile . In the practice of the present invention this means that, after evaporation of any solvents, less than 2 percent by weight per week of the coating composition will evaporate off the surface of an article at 25 C and 40 percent relative humidity. Preferably less than 1 percent by weight per week would evaporate and, more preferably, less than 0.1 percent by weight per week would evaporate at those temperatures and conditions. The greater the percentage of surfaces of components on and within the cassette that are coated with the organic, conductive coating compositions of the present invention, the greater the general reduction in electrostatic charging. This does not necessarily mean that greater amounts of the coating composition better reduce the electrostatic charging, but rather that it is important to insure the coating of as much surface are as possible in and on the cassette. Thus both interior and exterior surfaces of the cassette, reels, spools, structural supports, and other parts of the cassette should be coated. As the coating composition is likely to come in contact with the magnetic tape, which is not necessarily preferred, the coating composition should be selected so as to not be detrimental to the performance and structural integrity of the magnetic recording tape e.g., it should not be a strong solvent for the structural component of the tape . The coating composition should generally be applied so as to provide a dry without solvent coating weight of between 0.5 0.08 micrograms per square centimeter and 250 micrograms per square inch 40 micrograms per square centimeter as an average coating weight. Because the coating composition will not necessarily spread uniformly over the coated surface, or because of surface structure variations such as an embossed non glare surface , it is the average coating weight that must be considered in this range. If less than this amount of material is applied, insufficient antistatic protection will be provided. If greater than this amount is applied, no further antistatic protection is obtained, and an undesirable, highly greasy appearance will be provided to the coated article. Preferably a coating weight of 1 100 micrograms per square inch 0.16 to 16 micrograms per square centimeter is used or more preferably 1 50 micrograms per square inch 0.16 to 8 micrograms per square centimeter . In the most preferred practice of the present invention, 5 30 micrograms per square inch of the coating composition is used. The organic coating composition useful in the practice of the present invention is non integral as this provides the greatest static reduction. By non integral it is meant that the composition does not form a self supporting solid film when air dried, as it would be when an antistatic polymeric film is present on the surface of the cassette. The term non integral therefore excludes the provision of a solid, thermoplastic or non liquid conductive coating composition to the surface of the cassette. The composition of the cassette is immaterial to the practice of the present invention, since triboelectric charging can occur on substantially all solid surfaces. Generally, however, only synthetic resin compositions are used for the major structural components of cassettes. These may be either thermoplastic or thermoset resins. Amongst the various resins normally used in the production of cassettes acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic, styrene acrylonitrile resin, polystyrene, polycarbonates, high impact polystyrene and medium impact polystyrene, polyvinyl acetal and polyesters are generally used. Of course, dyes, fillers, molding aids and the like may be included within these compositions. Surprisingly, the inclusion of equal or larger quantities of antistatic materials into the composition used for structural portions of the cassette do not reduce static charging nearly as well as the applied coatings of the present invention, even where the same materials are used. These and other aspects of the present invention will be shown in the following non limiting examples. The following formulation was prepared in our laboratory for spray application to plastic components Properties Clear Solution of 0.1 by weight non volatile. The solution was applied from a Binks Model 69 air spray gun to ABS plastic components of the VHS format. The electrical potential due to the electrostatic surface charge of each component was measured before and after spray treatment by means of a Monroe Model 175 electrostatic voltmeter. Results were as follows The laboratory experiments were expanded to plant studies wherein technical feasibility of spray application to total assemblies was demonstrated. Evaluation of the treated assembled cassettes VHS confirmed the laboratory findings that electrostatic charges were reduced to an acceptably low level less than 300 volts . Competitive analyses were run on commercially available cassette products and the findings published namely, that the subject invention treatment reduced cassette body charges below 100 volts whereas all commercially available cassettes were orders of magnitude higher at 2000 11,000 volts . The publication referred to is a white paper that was released to the press on December 19, 1984. The paper explains the theory for static charge buildup and discusses antistatic agents. Although the performance of the present invention is described the paper does not disclose the specific composition of the present invention. Substantially identical results were obtained using isopropyl alcohol in place of the ethyl alcohol as solvent. The following tests were performed on six different commercially available VHS format cassettes. The cassettes were first electrostatically charged to about 13,000 volts. Electrometer probes were placed adjacent to each of the cassettes within 6 mm one quarter inch to measure static electricity bleed off at 24 C 76 F and 42 relative humidity. The charge was measured at various time intervals at least initially, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 20 hours and recorded. The lowest level of static charge for any of the cassettes, even after 20 hours of air discharge, was 1550 volts. The effect of anitstatic materials in the molding composition was compared to the same materials on the molded surface. An acrylonitrile butadiene styrene molding resing at a melt temperature of 243 C 470 F ws injected at 6.55 x 10 ⁶ Pa 950 p.s.i. into a cassette mold at 66 C 150 F . In the first run, no antistatic agents were included in the molding resin. The three following runs respectively contained 0.01 by weight, 0.10 by weight and 1.0 by weight of the antistatic system of Example 1. The residual charge was measured in the same manner as Example 2 and are compared in the Table below. The superiority of coated antistatic agent to included antistatic agent is apparent.
