# Apparatus for accurate determination of powder content in flowing gas stream.

## Abstract
Accurate measurements are made of powder entrained in a flowing gas stream. Measurements are made of the flowing gas stream prior to powder entrainment and x ray measurement techniques are made to determine characteris tics of the combined materials. An equation is disclosed for calculating the mass flow rate of the powder material from these measurements.
