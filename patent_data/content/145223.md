## Description
HIGHLY STABLE FREE IODINE IODOPHOR COMPOSITIONS, PROCESS FOR PREPARING SAME AND PROCESS FOR USING SAME The present invention relates to iodophor compositions containing highly stable free iodine, a process for preparing same and a process for using same as a fungicide or bactericide. Fungicidal compositions based on copper salts are well known to kill a wide variety of fungus on contact. However, these preparations act only on the external surfaces of plants and are not absorbed by plant tissues. Thus, these compositions only control the external fungi manifestation of infected vegetation while leaving unaffected the internal manifestation. That is, vegetation infected by fungus suffer internal damage, for example, energetic and hormonal imbalance, i.e., vegetation infected by bacteria or fungi suffer internal damage due to toxins generated by the pathogens as well as the plugging of the food conducting tissues at the union between the stock and scion which quickly kills the vegetation. Hence, it is desired that a fungicide bactericide not only kill fungi on the surface of the vegetation but also enter the plant system and be active therein. The term vegetation herein is intended to mean any plant, cane, vine, shrub, bush, tree or any vegetation in general. Attempts have been made to find a satisfactory method for effectively combating fungi such as coffee tree rust Hemileia vastatrix Berk. . However, known treatments have not achieved a satisfactory degree of success beyond a partial control of the external manisfestation of the fungi. Various iodophor compositions are well known in the art to be suitable as bactericides and fungicides.More specifically, U.S. Patent 4,271,149 teaches germicidal iodine compositions comprising an aqueous solution of iodine, iodide ion, iodate ion and an organic substance which slowly reacts with iodine, for example, a surface active agent such as ethoxylates of alkyl phenols. In such compositions, the free iodine level is maintained for extended periods of time by the presence of both an iodate ion and a buffer to control the pH within the range of 5 7. Such compositions are disadvantageous in that they require both the addition of an iodate ion and a buffer for maintainance of the pH range. U.S. Patent 4,288,428 teaches an iodophorous disinfecting composition comprising an iodophor in the form of an alkyl phenoxy poly ethyleneoxy ethanoliodine complex. This iodophor complex contains 5 10 by weight urea and an acid in an amount sufficient to maintain a pH between 1 5. This composition is disadvantageous in that it requires the use of both urea and an acid to control the pH as well as a solvent. U.S. Patent 4,113,857 discloses a method for producing an organic iodophor germicidal composition comprising reacting an organic iodophor forming compound, for example, nonyl phenoxy poly ethyleneoxy ethanol with an iodine adding agent, for example, potasium iodide , and hydriodic acid in the presence of an oxidizing stabilizer such as potasium iodate. This iodophor preparation is disadvantageous since it requires the use of hydriodic and an iodate. U.S. Patent 344,056 discloses a disinfectant consisting of a mixture of ammonium chloride, potassium iodide dissolved in water and iodine. However, this composition is disadvantages since it is not very stable. Great Britain Patent 1,191,970 teaches an iodo phor for combating Pseudomonas morsprumorum on cherry trees. The iodophor composition employed therein is not a free iodine complex, rather, it is an iodine carrier complex. An object of the present invention is to provide a highly stable free iodine iodophor composition that does not require the use of a buffer solution to maintain the pH so as to prevent reduction of the free iodine into iodide. Another object of the present invention is to provide a fungicide bactericide which is effective against internal fungi bacterial infections of vegetation, i.e., a fungicide bactericide which has systemic properties. An additional object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing the above described iodophor composition. A still further object of the present invention is to provide a method of use of the iodophor composition as a bactericidal, fungicidal, or disinfectant composition. The above objects of the present invention have been met in one embodiment by an iodophor composition comprising a an ether nonyl polyglycol ethoxylate having an ethylene oxide mole number greater than 4 represented by the following formula C9H19C6H4 OCH2CH2 XOH X number of moles of ethylene oxide b elemental iodine c potassium iodide and d optionally, an agriculturally acceptable liquid carrier or diluent. As stated above, the present invention relates to a highly stable free iodine iodophor composition comprising a an ether nonyl polyglycol ethoxylate having an ethylene oxide mole number greater than 4 b elemental iodine c potassium iodide and d optionally, an agriculturally acceptable liquid carrier or diluent. The stability of the iodophor composition of the present invention is obtained by the addition, to a free iodine solution, of the ether nonyl polyglycol ethoxylate having an ethylene oxide mole number greater than 4. That is, the oxidation of elemental iodine through potasium iodide is stablized by the non ionic compound, i.e, ether nonyl polyglycol ethoxylate having an ethylene oxide mole number greater than 4. While the upper limit of the ethylene oxide mole number is not critical, a typical upper range is 30.Examples of such ether nonyl polyglycol ethoxylates useful in the present invention includeHostapal 3634 ethylene oxide mole number of 10 ,Arkopal N 090 ethylene oxide mole number of 9 ,Arkopal N 080 ethylene oxide mole number of 8 ,Arkopal N 100 ethylene oxide mole number of 10 ,Arkopal N 060 ethylene oxide mole number of 6 ,Arkopal N 110 ethylene oxide mole number of 11 ,Arkopal N 130 ethylene oxide mole number of 13 ,Arkopal N 150 ethylene oxide mole number of 15 ,Arkopal N 230 ethylene oxide mole number of 23 andArkopal N 300 ethylene oxide mole number of 30 .When the ethylene oxide mole number increases, the solubility of the ether nonyl polyglycol ethoxylate is also increased. Preferably, Hostapal 3634,Arkopal N 060 and Arkopal N 100 are employed in the present invention. Some surface active agents induce foliar phytotoxicity at concentrations above 0.01 . The surface active agents employed in the present invention are ones where penetration of the composition into vegetation when applied to the surface thereof is enhanced. The ether nonyl polyglycol ethoxylate having an ethylene oxide mole number greater than 4 may be dissolved in, e.g., hard water or soft water at a temperature of about 700C, preferably not less than 600C, although higher temperatures, i.e., up to just less than the boiling point can also be used.The ether nonyl polyglycol ethoxylate having an ethylene oxide mole number greater than 4 cannot be used in water solutions containing more than 1.5 ppm chlorine since the stability thereof is adversely affected. A useful weight ratio of elemental iodine to potassium iodide is in the range of 1 1.01 to 1 1.05, preferably 1 1.03. It is preferable that the weight ratio of the ether nonyl polyglycol ethoxylate having an ethylene oxide mole number greater than 4 to the combined weight of the elemental iodine and the potassium iodide is 3 1 to 20 1, more preferably 6 1. The iodophor composition of the present invention is prepared by first dissolving elemental iodine and potassium iodide in water, at a temperature of not more than about 250C, preferably not less than 200C.Then, the mixture is diluted in 1 to 4 parts water Solution A . Next, an ether nonyl polyglycol ethoxylate having an ethylene oxide mole number greater than 4 is dissolved at a ratio of not more than 1.25 parts w w ether nonyl polyglycol ethoxylate having an ethylene oxide mole number greater than 4 to 1.0 part w w water at a temperature of 60 to 700C under agitation so as to achieve a concentration of preferably 55 by weight of ether nonyl polyglycol ethoxylate having an ethylene oxide mole number greater than 4.Thereafter, the solution is allowed to cool to a temperature of 20 250C Solution B . Then, Solution A and Solution B are slowly mixed together under agitation and thoroughly mixed so as to provide a weight ratio of the ether nonyl polyglycol ethoxylate having an ethylene oxide mole number greater than 4 to the combined weight of the elemental iodine and the potassium iodide of 3 1 to 20 1, preferably about 6 1. The resulting composition is represented by the formula C9H19C6H4 COCH2CH2 x13 I The resulting iodophor composition can be stably stored for extensive periods of time, e.g., more than two years, when stored in, for example, an amber stained glass or plastic opaque container at room temperature 250C to 300C without loss of fungicidal, bactericidal or disinfectant activity, as shown in the following Table. TABLE 1 Days Days Days Days Days Days DaysTEST 8 30 60 120 240 480 720P a Stability Separation good bad p is the density of the composition determined by measurements of mass and volume. a is the viscosity of the composition determined by a viscometer Cannon Fenske Stability is the stability of the composition determined by testing the bactericidal and fungicidal effectiveness of the composition Separation is a determination of the stability of the composition evaluated by visually comparing color and translucence. In Table 1, samples of the composition of this invention were stored and analyzed after a period of 8 days, 30 days, 60 days, 120 days, 240 days, 480 days and 720 days. The results in Table 1 indicate that no substantial changes were seen in the stability of free iodine in the compositions of the present invention. The iodophor composition of the present invention is particularly suitable for use on various plants that are infected with various fungi. For example, coffee trees infected with Hemileia vastatrix Berk or citric trees infected with Foot Rot Phytophthora parasitica Dast., Phythophthora citrophthora orDiplodia noctaleusis. In addition, the iodophor composition of the present invention is useful for killing various fungi and bacteria on fresh foods and vegetables. For example, the composition of this invention is effective against the following bacteria Bacillus sp. Staphyloccoccus sup. Coliphorms Candida sp. Salmonella typhi E. coli Shigella B. Proteus vulgaris Proteus mirabilis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Proteus morgani Proteus rettger Micobacterium andTuberculossum as well as the following fungi Septobasidium pseudopedicillatum Baurt., Collectrichum gloesporiodes or Elsinoe Fawcetti Bit.. Treatment with the iodophor composition of the present invention may be effective in a variety of ways such as spraying, brushing, washing or immersion. The iodophor composition of the present invention can be used in its original concentration by brushing or by any other application method directly to the trunk and branches of trees. Pruning cuts and other bark openings can also be treated with the composition of the present invention without any phytotoxic effects. These types of treatment are rapidly effective. It is preferable that vegetation is sprayed with an aqueous solution of from 2 to 100 v v , preferably 2 to 5 v v , of the iodophor composition of the present invention. When the amount used is below 2 v v , the effectiveness is decreased. As a systemic solution, the iodophor composition of the present invention is quickly absorbed through the leaves and bark of trees without danger of being washed out by rain, even if it rains about 3 to 4 hours after application. In addition, since there is no reduction of free iodine in the composition of the present invention, there is no danger of phytotoxic effects. The time most appropriate for treatment using the iodophor composition of this invention depends upon the time of fungal attack. It is preferable that the first treatment of the composition of the present invention occur about 30 days before the rainy season starts. Of course, this will vary depending upon the geographical location of the trees. At this time, the treatment will kill, by contact, the fungi endospores as a preventative treatment and at the same time will stimulate flowering, fructification and the growing of new stems as a result of the systemic action of the composition of the present invention in controlling the internal disease manifestation. It is preferred that a second treatment be made in the middle of the rainy season. At this time, any new fungus attack will be combated and again plant growth will be stimulated. The iodophor composition of the present invention is also suitable for sterilizing fruits and fresh vegetables. Once the fruit is picked from the tree it is susceptible to the invasion of microorganisms that cause rotting. At the same time, pathogenic bacteria can be picked up by contact with contaminated soil or water. In addition, blue or green mold, Penicillium sp., or stem end rot caused by Diaphorte citri orDiplodia noctaleusis can also infect the fruit.These microorganisms are effectively destroyed by the iodophor composition of the present invention.Spray application is recommended to treat leaves or other soft vegetables without damaging or impairing appearance. The following examples are illustrative of the present invention and are in no way intended to limit the scope thereof. EXAMPLE 1 The iodophor composition of the present invention used as a spray, three gallons of the composition as defined below diluted v v in 57 gallons of water, was sufficient to cover one hectare of a coffee plantation. Hostapal 3634 1.3177 IK 0.0922 I 0.0896 H2O 98.5005 100.0000 A hectare of coffee trees infected with Hemileia vastatrix Berk, located in El Salvador, CentralAmerica, was treated with the above 5 v v solution of the iodophor composition of the present invention in April, i.e., 30 days before the rainy season began.The rainy season in El Salvador lasts for about 6 months. A second hectare of coffee trees infected with Hemileia vastatrix Berk was left untreated as a control. The fungus on the surface of the treated trees was killed within 30 days after the treatment and fructification, flowering and the growing of new stems was stimulated thereafter. The fungus prevention effect of the single treatment with the iodophor composition of the present invention lasted 72 days.In contrast, the untreated coffee trees remained infected with the fungus and damage to the trees continued. EXAMPLE 2 The iodophor composition of the present invention can be used to combat fungi in several citric varieties and as shown below can be effective to control and cure Foot Rot disease caused by Phytophthora parasitica Dast., Phytophthora citrophthora andDiplodia noctaleusis. A solution of 5 v v of the iodophor composition of Example 1 was sprayed on one hectare of persic lemon trees infected with Foot Rot . The aqueous solution acted on the fungi endospores on the bark and leaves of the trees within a few days and was absorbed by the tree system where it acted to combat the internal fungi manifestation affecting the conducting tissues. Persic lemon trees not treated with the composition of the present invention and used as a control were killed by the Foot Rot . The iodophor composition of the present invention was also used in its original concentration by brushing it directly on the trunk and branches of persic lemon trees as well as a cover on pruning cuts. Sap leakage through damaged bark stopped in the treated persic lemon trees after about 10 to 20 days from the date of treatment. Abundant buds, new leaves and stems were also observed in the treated trees and early fruit dropping was reduced which increased the yield of fruit. In contrast, new leaves and stems were not observed in the untreated trees used as a control. EXAMPLE 3 An aqueous solution of 2 v v of the iodophorous composition of the present invention, as defined below, in water was sprayed on different fresh fruits and vegetables, i.e., citric fruit, bananas, tomatoes, lettuce, avocados, cucumbers, potatoes, cabbage and carrots on conveyor tables, at handling times or in wash dipping baths. Hostapal 3634 0.52708 IK 0.03688 I 0.03584 H2O 99.40020 100.00000 The solution destroyed the fungi and bacteria and thus sterilized the fruit as shown in Table 2 below.
