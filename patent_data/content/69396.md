# Preparation of pigmentary form of quinacridone pigments.

## Abstract
Pigmentary grade quinacridone pigments are prepared from crude quinacridone by conversion to aggregated low crystallinity quinacridones followed by milling the aggre gated low crystallinity quinacridone in the presence of a liquid which wets the pigment and can improve the crystal linity of quinacridone at 10 to 60 C. Suitable quinacridones include
