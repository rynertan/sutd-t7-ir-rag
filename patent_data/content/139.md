# Unloader for an X ray film holding casette.

## Abstract
Apparatus for opening a cassette, of the type which carries a sheet of X ray film, to allow the film to move into processing equipment, without requiring a darkroom. The apparatus includes a lighttight housing containing inclined guides for receiving the cassette, and pins at the bottom of the space between the guides, that can engage latches on the cassette to open it. The cassette is forced against the pins by a cover on the housing, which pushes on the cassette as the cover approaches its fully closed position, so the pins unlatch the cassette which opens to allow the film sheet to drop out.
