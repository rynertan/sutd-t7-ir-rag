## Description
IMIDAZOLE DERIVATIVES, THEIR PREPARATION AND THEIR USE AS FUNGICIDES This invention relates to imidazole derivatives, to a process for their preparation, and to the use of such derivatives as fungicides. EP A 91056 BASF discloses a class of 5 substituted 4 methylimidazole compounds of formulaEMI1.1 wherein X is inter aliaEMI1.2 RÚ is hydrogen or an aliphatic moiety and each Rê is independently hydrogen, an aliphatic moiety, a halogen atom or an alkoxy group. The compounds are disclosed as starting materials for plant protection compounds, dyestuffs and pharmaceuticals. W. German Offenlegungschrift 3 217 094 Hoeuschst discloses the preparation of various imidazole 5 carboxylic acid derivatives of formula EMI2.1 wherein R2 is a phenyl or benzhydryl group optionally substituted by one or more substituents selected fran halogen,C1 4 alkoxy and C1 4 alkyl moieties, X is 0, S or NR1 and R1 is H, phenyl, C26 alkenyl, optionally substituted C1 12 alkyl or, when X is O or S, a metal cation or ammonium. These derivatives are described as having fungicidal, herbicidal and plant growth regulant activity, and the compounds wherein R is an optionally substituted 2,6 dialkylphenyl group are claimed to be navel. There has now been discovered a novel class of 5 substituted imidazole derivatives having useful fungicidal activity. Acoording to the present invention there is provided an imidazole 5 carboximidate of general formulaEMI2.2 wherein R represents an optionally substituted phenyl group, R1 represents an optionally substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, aryl or aralkyl group, Rê represents an optionmally subastituted alkyl, cycloalayl, cycloalkylalkyl, enyl, aryl or aralkyl group, and X represents an oxygen or sulphur atom or a group where R represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group orR2 and R3 together with the interjacent nitrogen atan represent a 5 or 6 membered saturated or unsaturated heterocyclic ring optionally containing one or two further heteroatoms. Optional substituents include for example halogen atoms and alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, hydroxy, cyano, nitro, amino, carboxy, alkoxycarbonyl, phenyl, phenoxy, phenylthio, alkylthio and alkylsulfonyl groups, any alkyl moiety present preferably having up to 4 carbon atoms. R is preferably a phenyl group optionally substituted by a phenoxy group, a trifluoromethyl group a methoxy group, a nitro group and or by 1 to 5 halogen atans. Advantageously R is a phenyl group substituted by 1 to 3 halogen, preferably chlorine or fluorine, atoms or by a trifluoromethyl group and one or two halogen, preferably chlorine or fluorine, atoms. R1 is preferably a C1 12 alkyl, conveniently a C1 6 alkyl, group, a C3 8 cycloalkyl group, a C26 alkenyl group, a phenyl group or a benzyl group. It is further preferred that R2 is a C1 6 alkyl or haloalkyl group, a C38 cycloalkyl group, a C3 8 cycloalkyl methyl group, a C3 6 alkenyl group, a phenyl group or a benzyl group, X is O , S or NR , and R is a hydrogen atom or a C1 6 alkyl group, or Rê and R together with the interjacent nitrogen atom represent a triazole or pyrrolidine ring. A particularly prefered sub group of compounds of formulaI is that wherein R is 2,4 dichlorophenyl, 2,4 difloorohenyl or 4 chloro 2 trifluoromethylphenyl, RÚ is a C1 4 alkyl group, X is O , S or NCH3 and Rê is a C1 4, alkyl, e.g. ethyl, isoprcpyl or isobutyl, or C1 3 alkenyl, e.g. allyl or 3 but l enyl, group. The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of an imidazole 5 carboxamidate of formula I which comprises reacting a compound for formulaEMI3.1 wherein R and R1 are as defined above and L is a leaving group with a compound of formula H X R2 III where R2 and X are as defined above, in the presence of a base. The leaving group L may conveniently be a chlorine or bromine atom. In sate cases, e.g. when X is O , the compound of formula III may advantageously be treated with the base prior to admixture with the compound of formula II. Thus for example when the compound of formula III is an alkanol the mixture of compound of formula III with base may be achieved by dissolving sodium metal in the alkohol or by reaction of the alkanol with sodium hydride. In cases where X is NR , the base may be an excess of compound of formula III or it may be a base such as pyridine. In cases where X is S , the base may conveniently be a base such as pyridine. The above process may be effected in the absence of an additional, inert, solvent e.g. when the compound of formula III is in excess and the excess acts as a solvent, or in cases when e.g. pyridine is used as the base and itself acts as a solvent.Alternatively an additional, inert solvent may be present.Suitable solvents include dimethoxyethane, dimethylsulfoxide,N,N dimethylformamide and tetrahydrofuran. Dimethoxyethane and diltethylsuiphoxide have been found to be very suitable. Compound of formula II, wherein L is C1 or Br, may conveniently be prepared by reacting a oatcund of formulaEMI4.1 where R and R1 are as defined above, with a halogenating agent.Suitable halogenating agents include thionyl chloride, phosphorous pentachloride, phosphorous trichloride and phosphorous tribranide. Such reaction may if desired be effected in the presence of an inert solvent such as toluene, benzene, diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran. Compounds of formula IV are either known compounds or can be prepared by processes analogous to known processes, e.g. to processes described in R.G. Jones, J.Am.Chem.Soc. 71 1949 , 644, or in DE A 3 217 094 referred to above. Further in accordance with the invention there is provided a fungicidal ccmposition which comprises a carrier and, as active ingredient, a carboximidate of formula I as defined above. A composition according to the invention preferably contains fran 0.5 to 95 by weight of active ingredient. A carrier in a composition according to the invention is any material with which the active ingredient is formulated to facilitate application to the locus to be treated, which may for example be a plant, seed or soil, or to facilitate storage, transport or handling. A carrier may be a solid or a liquid, including a material which is normally gaseous but which has been compressed to form a liquid, and any of the carriers normally used in formulating fungicidal compositions may be used. Suitable solid carriers include natural silicas such as diatomceus earths magnesium silicates, for example talcs magnesium aluminum silicates, for example attapulgites and vermiculites aluminium silicates, for example kaolinites, montmorillonites and micas calcium carbonate calcium sulphate synthetic hydrated silicon oxides and synthetic calcium or aluminium silicates elements, for example carton and sulphur natural and synthetic resins, for example coumarone resins, polyvinyl chloride, and styrene polymers and copolymers solid polychlorophenols bitumen waxes, for example beeswax, paraffin wax, and chlorinated mineral waxes and solid fertilisers, for example superphosphates. Suitable liquid carriers include water alcohols, for example isopropanol and glycols ketones, for example acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone ethers aromatic or araliphatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene and xylene petroleum fractions, for example kerosine and light mineral oils chlorinated hydrocarbons, for example carbon tetrachloride, perchloroethylene and trichloroethane. Mixtures of different liquids are often suitable. Fungicidal compositions are often formulated and transported in a concentrated fran which is subsequently diluted by the user before application. The presence of small amounts of a carrier which is a surface active agent facilitates this process of dilution. Thus preferably at least one carrier in a composition according to the invention is a surface active agent. For example, a composition may contain at least two carriers, at least one of which is a surface active agent. Of particular interest in enhancing the duration of the prctectant activity of the compounds of this invention is the use of a carrier which will provide a slow release of the fungicidal compounds into the environment of the plant which is to be protected. Such slow release formulations could, for exariple, be inserted in the soil adjacent z nt to the roots of a vine plant, or could include an adhesive component enabling them to be applied directly to the stem of a vine plant. A surface active agent may be an emulsifying agent, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent it may be nonionic or ionic. Examples of suitable surfa z surface active agents include the sodium or calcium salts of polyacrylic acids and lignin sulfonic acids the condensation products of fatty acids or aliphatic amines or amides containing at least 12 carbon atans in the molecule with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide fatty acid esters of glycerol, sorbitan, sucrose or pentaerythritol condensates of these with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide oondensation products of fatty alcohol or alkyl phenols, for example Eroctylphenol or p octylcresol, with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide sulphates or sulphonates of these cosdensation products alkali or alkaline earth metal salts, preferably sodium salts, of sulphuric or sulphcnic acid esters containing at least 10 carbon atans in the molecule, for example sodium lauryl sulphate, sodium secondary alkyl sulphates, sodium salts of sulphonated castor oil, and sodium allylaryl sulphonates such as sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate and polymers of ethylene oxide and o3polymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The compositions of the invention may for example be formulated as wettable powders, dusts, granules, solutions, emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, suspension concentrates and aerosols. Wettable powders usually contain 25, 50 or 75 w of active ingredient and usually contain, in addition to solid inert carrier, 3 10 w of a dispersing agent and, where necessary, 0 10 of stabiliser s and or other additives such as penetrants or stickers. Dusts are usually formulated as a dust concentrate having a similar composition to that of a wettable powder but without a dispersant, and may be diluted in the field with further solid carrier to give a composition usually containing 10 w of active ingredient.Granules are usually prepared to have a size between 10 and 100 BS mesh 1.676 0.152mm , and may be manufactured by agglomeration or impregnation techniques. Generally, granules will contain 4 25 w active ingredient and 0 10 w of additives such as stabilisers, slow release modifiers and binding agents. fltulsifiable concentrates usually contain, in addition to a solvent and, often necessary, co solvent, 1 50 w v active ingredient, 2 20 w v emulsifiers and 0 20 w v of other additives such as stabilisers, penetrants and oorrosion inhibitors.Suspension concentrates are usually compounded so as to obtain a stable, non sedimenting flowable product and usually contain 10 75Fw of active ingredient, 0.5 15 w of dispersing agents, 0.1 10 w of suspending agents such as protective colloids and thixotropic agents, 0 10 w of other additives such as defoamers, corrosion inhibitors, stabilisers, penetrants and stickers, and water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is substantially insoluble certain organic solids or inorganic salts may be present dissolved in the formulation to assist in preventing sedimentation or as antifreeze agents for water. The compositions may also contain other ingredients, for example other compounds possessing pesticidal, especially insecticidal, acaricidal, herbicidal or fungicidal, prcperties. Aqueous dispersions and emulsions, for example compositions obtaining by diluting a wettable powder or a concentrate according to the invention with water, also lie within the scope of the present invention. The 8 said emulsions may be of the water in oil or of the oil in water type, and may have a thick like consistency. The invention still further provides the use as a fungicide of a carhoxiinidate of the general formula I as defined above, and a method for combating fungus at a locus, which comprises treating the locus, which may for example be plants subject to or subjected to fungal attack, seeds of such plants or the medium in which such plants are growing or are to be grown, with such a derivative. The present invention is of wide applicability in the protection of crop plants against fungal attack. Typical crops which may be protected include vines, grain crops such as wheat and barley, rice, z , beans and apples. The duration of protection is normally dependent on the individual carpaund selected, and also a variety of external factors, such as climate, whose impact is normally mitigated by the use of a suitable fn m llation. Application rates may typically be in the range 0.1 to 10 kg active ingredient per hectare kg ha , preferably 0.1 to 1 kg ha. The invention will be further understood fran the following Exarples.

The lower surfaces of leaves of whole vine plants cv Cabernet Sauvignon are sprayed with a solution of active material in 1 1v v water acetone containing 0.04 w Triton X 155 trade mark octyiphenol polyoxyethylene surfactant , at a dosage of 1 kilogram of active material per hectare using a track sprayer which delivers 620 l ha, and after a subsequent 24 hours under normal glasshouse conditions the lower surfaces z s of the leaves are inoculated by spraying with an aqueous solution containing 104 zoosporan9ia ml. The inoculated plants are kept for 24 hours in a high humidity compartment, 5 days ys under normal glasshouse conditions and then returned for a further 24 hours to high humidity.Assessment is based on the percentage of leaf area oeeered by sporulation with that on control leaves, b Direct protectant activity against vine grey could Botrytis cinerea Bcp The e test is a direct protectant one using a foliar spray and is effected as described under a , with the difference that the leaves are inoculated by spraying with an aqueous solution containing 105 conditia ml. c Activity against wheat leafspot Leptosphaeria nodorum Ln. The test is a direct antisporulant one, using a foliar spray. Leaves of wheat plants cv Mardler , at the single leaf stage, are inoculated by spraying with an aqueous suspension containing 8 x 105 spores ml. The inoculated plants are kept for 24 hours in a high humidity compartment prior to treatment. The plants are sprayed at a dosage of 1 kg. of active material per hectare using a track sprayer as described under a . After drying, the plants are kept for 5 days under normal glasshouse conditions, followed by assessment. Assessment is based on the percentage of leaf area covered by sporulation compared with that on leaves of control plants. d Activity against barley powdery mildew Erysiphe graminis f.sp. horde Eg The e test is a direct antisporulant one, using a foliar spray. Leaves of barley seedlings, cultivar Golden Praise, are inoculated by dusting with mildew conidia one day prior to treatment with the test compound. The inoculated plants are kept overnight at glasshouse ambient temperature and humidity prior to treatment. The plants are sprayed at a dosage of 1kg. of active material per hectare using a track sprayer as described under a . After drying, plants are returned to a compartment at ambient temperature and humidity for up to 7 days, followed by assessment. Assessment is based on the percentage of leaf area covered by sporulation compared with that on leaves of control plants. e Activity against apple powdery mildew Podosphaera leucotricha Pl The e test is a direct anti sporulant one using a foliar spray. The upper surfaces z e of leaves of whole apply seedlings are inoculated by spraying with an aqueous suspension containing 105 conidia ml 2 days ys prior to treatment with the test compound. The inoculated plants are immediately dried and kept at glasshouse ambient temperatures and humidity prior to treatment. The e plants are sprayed at a dosage of 1 kilogram of active material per hectare using a track sprayer as described under a . After drying the plants are returned to a compartment at ambient temperature and humidity for up to 9 days, followed by assessment. Assessment is based on the per percentage of the leaf area covered by sporulation compared with that on leaves of control plants. f Activity against broad bean rust Uromyces fabae Uf The test is a direct antisporulant one using foliar spray. Pots containing 1 plant per pot were inoculated by spraying an aqueous suspension, containing 5x104 spores ml plus a little Triton X 155 , onto the upper surface of each leaf 20 24 hours before treatment with test compound. The inoculated plants were kept overnight in a high humidity ccmpertnent, dried at glass house ambient temperature and then sprayed, on the leaf upper surface, z , at a dosage of lkg ha of active material using a track sprayer as described under a . After treatment the plants were kept at glass house temperature and assessment made 11 14 days after treatment.Symptoms s are assessed on the relative density of sporulating pustules per plant actFared with that on control plants. g Activity against rice leaf blast Pyricularia cryzae Po The test is a direct eradicant one using a foliar spray. The leaves of rice seedlings about 30 seedlings per pot are sprayed with an aqueous suspension containing 105 spores ml 20 24 hours prior to treatment with the test compound. The inoculated plants are kept overnight in high humidity and then allowed to dry before spraying at a dosage of 1kg of active material per hectare using a track sprayer as described under a . After treatment the plants are kept in a rice compartment at 25 30 C and high humidity. Assessments are made 4 5 days after treatment and are based on the density of necrotic lesions and the degree of withering when compared with control plants.
