# Sterile suspension and solution holding and mixing tank.

## Abstract
A mixing apparatus for preparing suspensions, emulsions and solutions, comprising a container 12 adapted for holding a mixture of materials to be formed into a suspension, emulsion or solution, and an external recirculation loop 31 connected to the container so that successive portions of the mixture of materials in the container can be continuously flowed in series through the external recirculation loop, characterized in that the external recirculation loop 31 has a first end communicating with the container near to the bottom of the container, and has a second end communicating with the container near to the bottom of the container but above the first end, and a mixing device 36 including a rotatable, hollow mixer head 37 disposed within the external recirculation loop 31 , the mixer head having an internal cavity having a centrally located inlet opening 51 at one end thereof and a plurality of circumferentially spaced apart radial slots 52 extending from the cavity and defining outlets therefrom, the mixer head being adapted upon rotation thereof to draw the mixture from the container 12 into the first end of the external recirculation loop, then into the internal cavity of the mixer head through the inlet opening 51 , then impel the mixture radially outwardly from the internal cavity through the slots 52 , whereby the mixture is intensely mixed and subjectcd to high fluid shear effective to homogenize the mixture, the mixture then flowing through the external recirculation loop to the second end thereof, then out of the second end into the interior of the container, whereby the mixture is continuously recirculated and mixed to form a homogeneous product.
