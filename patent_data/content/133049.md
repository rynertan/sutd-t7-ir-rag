# Video signal recording and reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A video signal recording and reproducing apparatus comprises a circuit 12 21, 25 for separating a luminance and carrier chrominance signals from a color video signal and for recording on and reproduction from a recording medium 23a, 23b a multiplexed signal in which a frequency modulated luminance signal and a frequency converted carrier chromi nance signal which is frequency converted into a low fre quency band are multiplexed, a circuit 28 for obtaining a reproduced luminance signal, a circuit 35 for obtaining a reproduced carrier chrominance signal which is in an original frequency band and has an original phase by subjecting a reproduced frequency converted carrier chrominance signal to a signal processing, a de emphasis circuit 33 supplied with the reproduction luminance signal and or an input signal or the reproduced carrier chrominance signal of the proces sing circuit, for relatively attenuating the level of a high frequency component in a temporal frequency of the repro duced luminance signal and or an input signal or the repro duced carrier chrominance signal of the processing circuit compared to a low frequency component, and a mixer 34 for mixing the reproduced luminance signal and the reproduced carrier chrominance signal so as to produce a reproduced color video signal.
