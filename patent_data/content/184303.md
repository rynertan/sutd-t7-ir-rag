## Abstract
A fuel injection system has an electronic module 60 mounted directly on a fuel body portion 12 of the fuel injection system for cooling by fuel flow through the fuel body 12 . The electronic module 60 energizes a fuel pump 66 to circulate fuel through the fuel body 12 , even when the engine is not operating, if the temperature within the module 60 exceeds a selected level.
