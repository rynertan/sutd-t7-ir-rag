# Method of thickening aqueous latex compositions.

## Abstract
A method of thickening an acidic aqueous coating composition comprising tannic and a latex of a film forming polymer substantially free from non ionic surtactants, char acterised in that a water soluble thickening agent for the aqueous latex which is non complexing with tannic acid is incorporated into the aqueous composition in the form of a gel like aqueous dispersion containing evenly dispersed particles of fumed silica, said thickening agent also being compatible with the tannic acid as used in the aqueous coating composition. The thickened acidic aqueous coating composition so produced is storage stable.
