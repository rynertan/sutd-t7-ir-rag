# Process for printed draw formed body, and container formed by this process.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a process for the preparation of a printed draw formed body having a printed image on the side wall thereof by subjecting a prior printed blank to draw forming, which comprises converting an image of an original to be printed to a digital image element signal on a rectangular coordinate, converting the image element signal on the rec tangular coordinate to an image signal or image signals on a corresponding conversion coordinate formed by developing the rectangular coordinate to an annular plane having an area substantially equal to the area of said rectangle, reading im age element signals on the conversion coordinate in order of the coordinate, photo electrically converting the read image element signals to a printing plate for the blank and printing the blank by using the formed printing plate. According to this process, since digital coordinate con version is performed while compensating anisotropy of the elongation of the metal blank, an improved printing precision can be obtained in a draw formed body.
