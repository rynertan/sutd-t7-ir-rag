## Description
A METHOD OF PRODUCING A LAYERED STRUCTURE This invention relates to a method of producing a layered structure, which layered structure is used for forming electrical interconnections in an integrated circuit. Integrated circuits, require the formation of layered structures comprising various levels of metal defining between them vias, that is metal to metal connections. There are three factors which determine how the metal layers at each level are to be defined. These three factors are 1 Metal to metal spacing m 2 Via size v 3 Metal surround width around the via s The metal pitch, which relates to the overall packing density is equal to m v 2s Normally, there are two considerations which require that the via be surrounded by metal both on first level metallisation and second level metallisation. Firstly, if the via is not contained within the first level metallisation, a gap is generally formed around the first level metal causing difficulties with second level metal step coverage within the via. These difficulties can result in excessive reductions in metal thickness in the connection between first and second level metal causing premature failure of the structure in use.Secondly, if the via surround is eliminated, problems can arise when, due to alignment tolerances, the second level metallisation does not completely cover the via. When this occurs, the first level metal is exposed in the via and may be etched during the etch process used to define the second level metal, resulting in excessive reductions in the thickness of the first level metal which may also cause premature failure of the structure in use. It is an aim of the present invention to remove the need for a surround to the via, so removing this factor from the above mentioned equation and thus affecting a significant improvement on the metallisation packing density. Accordingly, this invention provides a method of producing a layered structure, which method comprises utilising a lift off procedure for forming the first level metallisation, and providing an impervious top surface to the first level metallisation which forms an etch barrier between the first and second level metals. The lift off procedure for forming the first level metallisation may be such that the majority of an insulating spacer layer is left remaining and such that the first level metal is provided by magnetron sputtering. This may provide a much improved connection between the first and second metal layers. Delineation problems associated with etching composite metal layers are avoided by the use of the lift off method. According to the present invention there is provided a method for producing a layered structure having first and second levels of metallisation, the method characterised by forming the first level of metallisation by depositing a parting layer on a spacer layer, etching the parting layer and the spacer layer to delineate field regions therein, depositing a first metal layer, depositing an etch barrier layer, and dissolving the parting layer to remove the first metal layer and the etch barrier layer in the field regions. Preferably, the method of the present invention is characterised by, after dissolving the parting layer, depositing a passivation layer, depositing a dielectric layer on the passivation layer, exposing the etch barrier layer through the passivation layer and the dielectric layer, depositing a second metal layer, and etching the second metal layer to form the second level of metallisation. Preferably, the metal layers are deposited by magneton sputtering. The parting layer and the spacer layer may be etched by plasma etching. Preferably, the plasma etching comprises oxygen plasma etching. The formation of the via and the second level metallisation may be effected as set out in the method described in our co pending Patent Application No. 8309341 and entitled Integrated Circuit Processing Method . The disclosure in this co pending patent application is incorporated herein by reference. An embodiment of the invention will now be described solely by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 illustrates a nested via and is for use in illustrating metallisation layout rules Figure 2 illustrates a non nested via and is for use in illustrating metallisation layout rules Figure 3 illustrates the problems which can arise with second metal deposition if a via is not contained within the first level metallisation and Figure 4 illustrates a method of forming a via according to the present invention. Referring to Figures 1 and 2, there is illustrated, for nested and non nested vias, the metal to metal spacing m , the via size v , the metal surround around the via s , the minimum metal width w , and the via to via gap g . For the nested via illustrated in Figure 1, the metal pitch, which relates to the overall packing density, in an integrated circuit is equal to m v 2s. In the non nested via illustrated in Figure 2, the metal pitch equals m w or v g, whichever is the greater. It can be seen by comparing Figures 1 and 2 that the via pitch with non nested vias is smaller than that of nested vias. However, due to alignment tolerances present in current methods of forming vias, non nested vias are more likely to give rise to defects in the resulting layered structure, as previously described. Figure 3 shows the problem which can arise if the via is not contained within the first level metallisation. A gap 2 is formed around the first level metal which produces a steep sided and deep via in which it is extremely difficult to deposit the second metal layer. Often, the second metal layer contains portions having excessive reductions in metal thickness and micro cracks are common. Referring now to Figure 4, this Figure has been divided into five parts, namely Figures 4a,b,c,d and e. Referring to Figure 4a, it will be seen that a polyimide is coated and imidised onto a suitable substrate such as silicon to provide a spacer layer 4 for the first metal lift off. A thin organic film in the form of a photo resist film is spun onto the spacer layer 4 to act as a parting layer 6 for the lift off procedure. An aluminium masking layer 8 is then deposited on the parting layer 6 and the field regions of the first layer metal, that is regions where it is desired to remove metal in the first layer metal, are delineated in this masking layer 8 such that the masking layer 8 is etched where the first layer metal is required, to form a masking pattern. Referring to Figure 4b, the parting layer 6 and the spacer layer 4 are etched through the masking pattern in the masking layer 8 using an oxygen plasma etch to form a via in the spacer layer 4. The first layer metal 10 is now deposited by magnetron sputtering. The first layer metal is essentially pure or doped aluminium but it is covered with a thin layer of chromium to produce an etch barrier layer 12.It can be seen from Figure 4b that at this stage of the process, the via contains a layer of the first metal 10 capped by the etch barrier layer 12. Referring now to Figure 4c, a lift off is executed to produce the first level of metallisation by dissolving the parting layer 6 in a suitable solvent, thus floating off the masking layer 8 and the first layer metal 10 and the etch barrier layer 12 over the field regions, exposing the surface of the spacer layer 4. A thin silicon passivation layer 14 may now be deposited over the spacer layer 4 and the remaining first layer metal 10 and etch barrier layer 12. The passivation layer 14 acts to protect the spacer layer 6 during subsequent stages of the process. The passivation layer 14 may be 25A thick and it may be of another material such as for example titanium. A dielectric layer 16 is now deposited on the passivation layer 14 and imidised. The dielectric layer 16 may comprise any suitable insulating material such as polyimide. When the dielectric layer is imidised the silicon passivation layer normally converts to silicon oxide. A masking pattern is then formed on the dielectric layer 16 and the dielectric layer 16 and the underlying passivation layer 14 are etched in accordance with the masking pattern to expose the etch barrier layer 12 in the via through the passivation layer 14 and the dielectric layer 16. The passivation layer 14 can be removed from within the via either by wet etching or back sputtering.This produces the structure shown in Figure 4d of the accompanying drawings. A layer of second level metal 18 is now deposited over the structure shown in Figure 4d, with the interconnection between the second level metal 18 and the first level metal 10 being made in the via by means of the chromium etch barrier layer 12, as shown in Figure 4e. A masking pattern is then formed over the second level metal 18 and the second level metal is etched through the masking pattern to remove unwanted metal in the field regions of the second level metallisation. The purpose of the chrome etch barrier layer 12 will now become clear. Due to alignment tolerances, the masking pattern used to enable selective etching of the second level metal 18 may not be aligned exactly with the via. If this misalignment occurs in the process, the second level metal 18, when etched, will be as shown in Figure 4e. The presence of the etch barrier layer 12 prevents the first level metal 10 being etched in the region 20 and hence, the excessive reductions in thickness of the first level metal, experienced with existing methods, do not The method of the invention provides a reliable method of achieving high density multi level metallisation by using non nested vias. No factor for via surround is incorporated in the equation for metallisation pitch, thereby achieving a significant improvement in metallisation packing density. The method also incorporates a solution to first level metal attack and via step coverage problems that are usually encountered when fabricating non nested vias with current processing methods. The method of the invention is particularly applicable to the provision of oxide isolated 12L integrated circuits where, with current techniques, metallisation packing density is limiting circuit density. It is to be appreciated however that the invention can also be used in most double level metallisation applications with similar benefits. The method of the invention can also be used for more than two levels of metal. It is to be appreciated that the embodiment of the invention described above with reference to the accompanying drawings has been given by way of example alone in that modifications may be effected. Thus, for example, the masking layer 8 may be of a metal other than aluminium and the plasma etching of the parting layer 6 and the spacer layer 4 may be by a plasma etching other than oxygen plasma etching. The first layer metal is preferably aluminium or doped aluminium but other metals may be employed. Also, the first layer metal is preferably capped with chromium but again other metals may be employed.
