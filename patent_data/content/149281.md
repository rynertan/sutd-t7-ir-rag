# Magnetic head.

## Abstract
A magnetic head is provided having a core of a soft magnetic material with a comparatively low saturation magnetization and layers of a soft magnetic material having a higher saturation magnetization than the material of the core on the gap bounding faces. In order to avoid the detrimental effects of the non magnetic transition zones between the material of the core and the layers of soft magnetic material, which transition zones as it were form subsidiary gaps, the layers of soft magnetic material on the gap bounding faces have different thicknesses.
