# Particle agglomeration in rubber latices.

## Abstract
Particle size distribution in elastomeric latex prepara tions is advantageously controlled and improved by treat ment of the prepared latex with an agglomerating agent AgAg copolymer having an elastomeric core and grafted thereto a shell of interpolymer comprising polymerized acid and ester comonomers. The grafted interpolymer can beneficially be a polymerized mixture of ethyl acrylate and methacrylic acid. Agglomerated latex product can be reco vered for direct utilization of its favorably particle size distributed elastomeric component or for other purposes such as grafted polymer blends, ABS and similar products.
