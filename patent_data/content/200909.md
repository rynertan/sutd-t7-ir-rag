# Preparation of protein G and or fragments thereof

## Abstract
Hybrid DNA technique for the manufacture of protein G and or fragments of protein G with substantially the same properties as protein G insofar as the capability of binding IgG is concerned. In accordance with the invention a hybrid DNA molecule is produced comprising a vector into which has been introduced a DNA sequence deriving from streptococci which codes for protein G and or the said fragments thereof. In accordance with the invention, moreover, a micro organism is produced belonging, for example, to a strain of E.coli which has been transformed by a hybrid DNA molecule in accordance with the above, and a method for preparing the transformed micro organism. Finally, a method is provided for the preparation of protein G and or the said fragments thereof, according to which a micro organism which has been transformed by the said hybrid DNA molecules cultivated in a suitable culture medium and the protein G product is isolated.
