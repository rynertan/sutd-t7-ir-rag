# A VERTICAL TYPE ELECTROLYTIC CELL AND ELECTROLYTIC PROCESS USING THE SAME

## Abstract
Disclosed is a vertical type electrolytic cell partitioned by an ion exchange membrane into an anode compartment and a cathode compartment, the cathode compartment be ing divided by a non perforated cathode plate into a cathode gas generation room and a cathode gas separation room. Also disclosed is an electrolytic process using the elec trolytic cell in which operation is carried out while circulat ing catholyte between the two rooms thanks to gas lift effect produced by cathode gas.
