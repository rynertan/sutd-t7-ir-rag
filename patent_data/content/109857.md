# Monoazo dye for synthetic fibers.

## Abstract
A monoazo dye for synthetic fibers is of the general formula The dyes are produced by coupling a diazonium salt of 2 amino 3 cyano 5 nitrothiophenone with the required ani line derivative, numerous examples of which are given. Synthetic fibers, especially polyesters, are dyed with a dye bath or printing paste of the dye, to give a clear blue color with excellent fastness to sublimation, fastness to light, and resistance for after finishes and alkali discharge.
