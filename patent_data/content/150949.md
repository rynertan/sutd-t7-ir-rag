## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS The present invention relates to a detergent composition that is intended to be used after application to the skin of a depilatory cream having as its active ingredient a sulphur containing depilatory material It also provides a method for removing body hair using the detergent composition for washing the skin. Presently available depilatory creams commonly employ as active ingredient a sulphur containing depilatory material such as thioglycollic acid or a salt thereof such as calcium thioglycollate at a pH of about 12.5. The cream is applied to the skin and mechanically removed with the unwanted hair after a few minutes. After all visible traces of the cream have been removed, the present recommendation is that the skin should be washed in plain water. Current soaps or detergents have an alkaline reaction and are inappropriate for use until the skin has recovered, otherwise the user may notice a stinging sensation.But neither water nor currently available detergent materials effectively remove calcium salts such as calcium thioglycollate that are present in the pores of the skin or adsorbed on skin cells and that are responsible for the persistant odour associated with the use of depilatory creams because they break the disulphide bonds in skin keratin. Instead they may produce calcium soaps that are insoluble and are trapped in the pores with thioglycollate residue. It is an object of the invention to provide a detergent composition that has the same pH as skin about 6 or less preferably 5.3 5.8 and is effective in removing insoluble sulphur containing depilatory residues from the skin. Broadly stated the invention provides a detergent composition for washing the skin after application of an alkaline sulphur containing depilatory composition, said composition having a pH of less than 6 and comprising an anionic surfactant that is effective at a pH of less than 6 and does not form a water insoluble calcium salt, a sequestering agent for calcium and a non ionic thickener. The amount of detergent present in the composition may be about 13.5 w w and the major anionic surfactant present is preferably an amine salt of a sulphated fatty acid e.g. the monoethanolamine salt of lauryl sulphate.An ethoxylated fatty acid monoethanolamide may be present in minor amounts as foam enhancer as may be a surfactant which is a dimethylamine oxide derivative of an ethoxylated fatty alcohol. The composition may contain up to 8 w w of sequestering agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and its salts e.g.disodium edetate and glucoheptanoic acid and its salts e.g. sodium glucoheptanoate. A water soluble cellulose based thickener or viscosity adjuster may be used in amounts of up to 10 w w depending upon the properties required, and hydroxyethyl cellulose is a preferred material. The composition may contain an emollient which is a lanolin derivative e.g. an ethoxylated lanolin alcohol in an amount of up to 20 w w, and may further contain minor amounts of preservative, colouring and perfume together with antioxidants and UV absorbers. The pH may be adjusted by means of citric acid or another weak organic acid. The invention further provides a method for removing body hair which comprises applying to an area of the skin a chemical depilatory composition, allowing the composition to react with the hair, removing the loosened hair and washing the area of the skin with a composition as aforesaid. The invention yet further provides a method for removing residues from the chemical depilation of the skin which comprises washing the skin with a composition as aforesaid. The depilatory composition may be applied by a roller applicator as described in our co pending application No. . It may comprise up to 10 of a sulphur containing depilatory material, 0.5 30 of an emulsifying wax to give an oils in water cream, 0.1 5 w w of an inert cellulosic thickener that disperses in the aqueous phase and sufficient alkali to give a pH of 9.012.5. The depilatory material present in the composition may be derived from a thio compound such as thioglycollic acid, thiolactic acid, 3 mercaptopropionic acid and thioglycerol. The acids may be neutralised with alkali metals or alkaline earths such as lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, barium and strontium. Calcium thioglycollate is the preferred material because it combines high depilatory activity with low skin irritation. The depilatory composition is desirably formulated to achieve a low fat content and give hydrophilic properties to the composition so that it wets the skin and is easy to remove. Thus the cream or composition base of the oil in water kind may be formed by incorporating into the composition 0.5 30 of a non ionic emulsifying wax such as that sold by Henkel under the tradename DehydagAO which contains 80 cetostearyl alcohol and 20 cetomacrogol. To reduce the harshness of the composition when applied to the skin there may be present other inert emollient waxes and oils such as heavy liquid paraffin in amounts of up to 20 w w. The thixotropy of the composition is maintained at a minimum in order that it should stabilise at the correct viscosity for roller application and flow correctly through the reservoir and applicator head.A non ionic thickener is preferably therefore incorporated into the aqueous phase of the composition, and water soluble cellulosic thickeners such as hydroxyethyl cellulose may be used in amounts of 0.1 5t w w. The latter material is film forming and protects the composition from yellowing due to atmospheric oxidation on composition drying in air. The pH adjuster is preferably at least in part a solid material in order that it may perform the additional function of influencing the flow properties of the composition, and for this purpose the composition may contain up to 10 w w of an alkaline earth oxide or hydroxide such as ground calcium oxide together with up to 4 w w of lithium hydroxide and a minor proportion of an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium or potassium hydroxide to achieve the preferred pH of about 12.5. The depilatory composition preferably also contains one or more sequestering agents that are effective for calcium ions at high pH values i.e. pH 9 and above and the sequestering agent may comprise a major proportion of sodium glucoheptonate and a minor proportion of HEEDTA or a salt thereof such as the trisodium salt. The composition may also contain incidental ingredients such as perfumes, humectants, antioxidants, U V absorbers and preservatives. The above composition may be applied, e.g. to the legs, by means of a roller applicator, left in contact with the skin for 1 15 minutes to soften the hair and then washed off by means of the detergent composition aforesaid. The invention may be provided in the form of a pack containing in a first container a depilatory composition having as principal active ingredient calcium thioglycollate or another salt of thioglycollic acid and in a second container a detergent composition as previously described. A third container may be included in the pack that contains an after care composition for restoring natural oils to the skin.

The skin was then washed using the gel composition of Example 1.
