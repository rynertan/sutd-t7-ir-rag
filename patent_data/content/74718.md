# Microorganism inhibition of frost damage to plants.

## Abstract
Plant host acceptable microorganisms, which are ice nucleation deficient and use at least one nutrient from the plant also used by ice nucleating native microorganisms, are applied to a plant part at an early stage in the growth cycle. The multiplication of the native ice nucleating microorgan isms is inhibited, so that under normal frost conditions encountered in the field, frost damage is substantially diminished. The non nucleating microorganisms may be obtained by special selection procedures, selecting from naturally occuring microorganisms or mutagenized microor ganisms, where additionally the organisms may be trans formed to provide for other desirable properties.
