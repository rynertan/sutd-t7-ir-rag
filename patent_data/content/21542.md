# Method for preparing a water containing vinyl acetate polymer dispersion, dispersion thus prepared and protective colloid used thereby.

## Abstract
Vinyl acetate monomer and initiator are added to a water solution from an emulsifier and hydroxypropyl starch and or hydroxyethyl starch. By using substituted starch with a degree of substitution which is higher than 0,8 substituted glucose hydroxyl groups per anhydroglucose unit, a small amount of emulsifier, between 0,5 to 5 weight from the monomer, can be used to obtain the optimum protecting and thickening action of the starch derivatives. Particularly the degree of substitution lies between 0,8 to 1,80 substituted hydroxyl groups per anhydroglucose unit when the starch is hydroxypropyl starch and between 0,8 and 2,75 substituted hydroxyl groups per anhydroglucose unit when the starch is hydroxyethyl starch.
