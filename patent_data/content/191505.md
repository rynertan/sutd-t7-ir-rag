# METHOD OF PRODUCING SHEETS OF CRYSTALLINE MATERIAL

## Abstract
A method of producing sheets of crystalline material upon a dielectric substrate 80 , wherein a portion of single crystal semiconductor material 82a is disposed on the substrate 80 , non single crystal semiconductor material is deposited on the substrate in proximity to the single crystal portion 82a and the non single crystal deposit is converted into a single crystal layer 82b overlying the substrate by heating to melt or recrystallize the non single crystal deposit.
