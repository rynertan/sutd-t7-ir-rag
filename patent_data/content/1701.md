# Electrical connector for terminating coaxial cable.

## Abstract
An electrical connector for terminating a coaxial electrical cable 1 comprising a centre conductor 2 and a concentric outer conductor 3 spaced from the centre conductor 2 by a layer of dielectric material 4 , the connector comprising a centre contact 6 for crimp connection to a bared end portion of the centre conductor 2 of the cable 1 , a conductive sleeve 7 having a relatively small diameter first end portion 8 adapted to be received between the dielectric layer 4 and an exposed portion ferrule 9 for crimping about the outer conductor portion of the cable on the first end portion 8 of the conductive sleeve 7 , a dielectric spacer sleeve 11 received in a relatively large diameter second end portion 10 of the conductive sleeve 7 , and having a bore 12 to receive the crimped centre contact 6 , a cylindrical outer contact 18 in electrical contact with the conductive sleeve 7 and a coupling member 21 retained on the conductive sleeve 7 by engagement between projections 23 on the conductive sleeve 7 at the inner end of the second end portion 10 thereof, and an inner end 20 of the outer contact 18 , the outer contact 18 being in frictional engagement with the outer surface of the second end portion 10 of the conductive sleeve 7 .
