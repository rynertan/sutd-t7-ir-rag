# Compositionally varied materials and method and system for synthesizing the materials.

## Abstract
Materials are provided containing nonperiodically distributed local environments whose position and type are controlled to obtain specific properties which can be coupled or decoupled one from another and collectively from the constraints implied by an ordered structure. The compositional variation is accomplished by selectively depositing atoms and groups of atoms by means, e.g., of ion beams 16, 18 etc. into designed locations on a substrate 36 to construct a true three dimensionally engineered material. Where order is needed, it can be designed in a local scale or interspersed in varying amounts including layers through the material to create new material functions.
