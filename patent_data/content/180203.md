## Abstract
A method of and an apparatus for recording and reading out radiation image information. The apparatus includes a cir culatory feed system for feeding stimulable phosphor sheets 26 each capable of recording radiation image information along a predetermined circulatory feed path, an image record ing unit 16 for exposing the stimulable phosphor sheets 26 to a radiation through an object to record the radiation image information of the object on the stimulable phosphor sheets, an image readout unit 44 having a stimulating light source 50 for emitting stimulating light to scan the stimulable phos phor sheets 26 with the radiation image information recorded thereon and a photoelectric readout device 44 for detecting light emitted from the stimulable phosphor sheets 26 scanned by the stimulating light to produce image signals, and an image erase unit 74 for discharging remaining radiation energy from the stimulable phosphor sheets 26 after the im ages have been read therefrom by the image readout unit 44 and before new radiation images are recorded on the stimu lable phosphor sheets 26 by the image recording unit 16 . Prior to successive recording of images on the stimulable phosphor sheets 26 , any remaining images and dust are erased from the sheets, and the sheets are checked for de fects or scratches thereon. Any sheet bearing such a defect is controlled to skip image recording, readout, and erasing steps. The frequency of erasing the remaining image on a stimulable sheet in the erasing step is controlled dependent on the amount of the radiation to which the object is exposed.
