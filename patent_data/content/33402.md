# Perfusate for preserving organ to be transplanted and preserving method.

## Abstract
An organ to be transplanted, such as a kidney, can effec tively be preserved for an increased period of time by perfu sion using a perfusate which is made of a Ringer s solution modified by increasing its potassium ion content to 8 20 meq liter with a stably emulsified perfluorocarbon com pound and dissolved albumin. A preferred concentration of the perfluorocarbon compound, for example perfluorodeca lin, is 7.5 to 12.5 W V and that of albumin is 1 8 W V based on the perfusate.
