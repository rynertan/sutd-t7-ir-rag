# Novel phenothiazines, preparation thereof and use thereof in electrochromic recording systems.

## Abstract
3 R Carbonyloxy 7 N R¹ N R² amino 10 RCO phenothiazines userful as color formers, particu larly in electrochromic recording systems, are prepared by the interaction of the corresponding 7 N R¹ N R² ami no phenothiazin 3 one with a reducing agent to obtain the corresponding leuco compound and subsequently interact ing the leuco compound with about two molecular propor tions of an acylating agent.
