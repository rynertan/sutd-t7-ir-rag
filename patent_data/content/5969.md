# Anchoring cartridges and method of anchoring an anchor element.

## Abstract
The invention concerns an anchoring cartridge for use in anchoring an anchor element in a hole in a substrate by means of a self setting composition comprising interactive solid and liquid components. The cartridge comprises a container 1 housing the solid component 4 of the composition, the container being formed of a material such as metal or plastics, which does not absorb the liquid component of the composition. The container has a plurality of holes 2 , preferably each between 0.1 mm² and 500 mm² in area, whereby when the cartridge is immersed in the liquid component, the liquid passes through the holes 2 into the container 1 and reacts with the solid component 4 to form the self setting composition. When the cartridge is immersed in the liquid component, loss of self setting composition through the holes 2 is prevented by, for example, including a thixotropic agent in the composition or by compaction of the solid component 4 . The invention includes a method of anchoring an anchor element in a hole substrate using the cartridge.
