# Gelled aqueous slurry explosives containing gas bubbles.

## Abstract
An improved method of gassing an aqueous slurry explosive composition with an inorganic nitrite gassing agent is provided. The method makes use of thiocyanate ion containing material in the composition as a gassing accelerator. Suitable accelerators comprise sodium thiocyan ate or ammonium thiocyanate. The presence of the thiocyan ate ion produces improved rate and quantity of gas genera tion even under low temperature where gas generation is normally retarded. The effect of the acceleration may be enhanced by the addition of a primary amino group containing material such as acrylamide, ethanolamine or urea.
