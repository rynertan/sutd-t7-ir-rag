# Tunneling gate semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor device includes an insulation film 4 through which a charge can tunnel, a gate insulation film 40 of a material different from the material of said insulation film 4 or having a thickness different from that of said insulation film 4 , and a floating gate 5 extending over said tunnelable insulation film 4 . At least two sides of said tunnelable region 4 are bounded by a device separation oxide film 7 .
