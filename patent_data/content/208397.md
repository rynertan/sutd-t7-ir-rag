# Temperature compensation for ECl circuits.

## Abstract
An ECL circuit comprising an output transistor Q4 hav ing a high output voltage VOH guard band 1 and a low output voltage VOL guard band 12 with a temperature compensat ing network 30 coupled to the output transistor Q4 for caus ing the high level output voltage VOH and low level output voltage VOL of the output transistor Q4 to remain within the maximum and minimum limits of the VOH and VOL guard bands 1,2 over a wide temperature range.
