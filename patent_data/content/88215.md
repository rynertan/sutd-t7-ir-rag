# Air circuit breaker.

## Abstract
The disclosure describes an air circuit breaker com prising a compression coil 31 a first spring holder 302 to compress the compression coil in the axial direction the reof and a second spring holder 301 which is subjected to the compression force of the compression coil, the first spring holder 302 being constructed in such a manner that it is formed of a plate material in a rectangular shape, a pair of projected pieces 316, 317 are provided on both sides of the plate material, and a pin 315 is held to pass between the pair of projected pieces in the direction of thickness of the plate so as to be able to support one end of the energy accumulating spring 31 at four points with the pair of projected pieces 316, 317 and the pin 315 in a compress ible manner. After compression of said energy accumulat ing spring by pressure application thereto, its pressure application is released to stretch the energy accumulating spring so as to close a pair of contact points through the first and second spring holders 301, 302 .
