# Ring laser gyroscopes.

## Abstract
Triaxial ring laser gyroscopes have three interconnecting cavities which provide many paths along which discharge can be initiated, and consequently it has been found that it is dif ficult to achieve the correct discharge. It is therefore proposed to align the desired discharge paths with the electrostatic fields which exist due to the voltage differences between the cathode and each one of the six anodes to enhance the initia tion of the correct discharge.
