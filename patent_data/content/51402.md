# A photomask for, and a method of, producing semiconductor devices.

## Abstract
A photomask for use in the production of semiconductor devices comprises a transparent substrate 1 on one surface of which a mask pattern is formed by a photoshielding film 2 and the opposite surface of which is roughened so that rays of light incident upon it are randomly refracted. This random refraction prevents minute particles of dust 3 casting shadows and so contributing to the projected image of the photomask.
