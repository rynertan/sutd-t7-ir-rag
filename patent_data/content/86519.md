# A BINARY SELECTOR STAGE AND A SELECTOR AND SELECTOR SYSTEM COMPRISING SUCH SELECTOR STAGES

## Abstract
Contemporary communication networks, telephony ex changes in particular, are frequently provided with a central control. A consequence there of is that they are very complex. The invention provides a communication network having a high degree of distributed control and processing by providing a bi nary selector stage with which selectors and selector systems are assembled which are employed in the entire network. The selector stage comprises an identification circuit 10 for ident ifying destination addresses applied to input 12 and which are considered to be associated with the service area of the selector stage. An indicator circuit 11 determines in a list of free outputs 32 to which free output the destination address, which is identified by 10 and transferred to a first output 16 , must be conveyed. Non identified destination addresses are transferred to a second output 14 to which output a further selector stage can be connected.
