# Combined dynamic focus circuit flyback capacitor.

## Abstract
In a cathode ray tube CRT display system utilizing a semiconductor switch 22 in the output stage of the fast scan axis, a resonant circuit L1, C3 is coupled to the flyback circuit for production of a dynamic focus voltage. The capacitance required for the flyback circuit is derived from the equivalent capacitance of the dynamic focus resonant circuit, thereby eliminating the need for a separate flyback capacitor.
