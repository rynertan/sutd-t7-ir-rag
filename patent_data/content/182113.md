## Description
CO INITIATOR COMPOSITION AND PROCESS FOR P METHYLSTYRENE POLYMERIZATION BACKGROU ND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to the polymerization of para methylstyrene, and particularly to an improvement in known processes for such polymerization whereby an increase in the polymerization rate is achieved, together with a higher molecular weight product and a narrower molecular weight distribution. Since its development, poly paramethylstyrene has gained increasing popularity over its earlier developed analog polystyrene, due to superior physical and processing properties. These include a lower vapor pressure, higher flash point, lower density and higher softening point, as well as the fact that its starting monomer, p methylstyrene, is fabricated from a less expensive raw material, i.e., toluene as opposed to benzene. Both styrene and p methylstyrene are known to be best polymerized in the presence of a combination of free radical initiators, particularly peroxides. The combination consists of a high emperature peroxide i.e., one which decomposes to the free radical form at relatively high temperatures and a low temperature peroxide one which decomposes at the same rate at lower temperatures . A wide range of combinations has been suggested, although the most commonly used is t butylperoxybenzoate high and benzoyl peroxide low, also known as dibenzoyl peroxide . It has now been discovered that certain lowtemperature peroxide initiators are unique among the wide range of species heretofore generally disclosed in terms of their ability to produce a polymer of high molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution when applied to p methylstyrene, and to do so in a relatively short period of time. Since high molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution are considered beneficial in certain applications, this subclass of low temperature species provides a distinct advantage in p methylstyrene polymerization. The faster reaction time further provides an economic benefit. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The class of low temperature peroxide initiators demonstrating the unusual behavior which is the subject of this invention are a monosecondary peroxy esters having the structural formulaEMI2.1 and b disecondary peroxy esters having the structural formulaEMI2.2 in which R, R1, R2, R3, R4, R6, R7, R8 and R9 are straight chain or branched chain alkyl or alkenyl groups of up to 12 carbon atoms each, and R5 is either ethylene CH2 CH2 or ethynylene C C . Within the scope of the above formulae, certain embodiments are preferred, namely those in which R, R1 R4 and R6 R9 are alkyl, particular C1 C6 alkyl those of Formula I in which R and R1 collectively contain up to 10 carbon atoms and R2, R3 and R4 collectively contain up to 8 carbon atoms and those of Formula II in which R5 is ethylene, R6 and R7 collectively contain up to 10 carbon atoms, R8 and R9 collectively contain up to 10 carbon atoms, and the formula is symmetrical. Examples of monosecondary peroxy esters ofFormula I are Name R R1 R2 R R4 t butyl peroxy C H C H CM CM CM 2 ethylhexanoate 4 9 2 5 3 3 3 t butyl peroxy CM CH CM CH CH isobutyrate 3 3 3 3 3 t amyl peroxy C4H9 C2H5 CH3 CH3 C2H5 2 ethylhexanoate 1,1,3,3 tetramethyl C2H5 C2H5 CH3 CH3 butyl peroxy2 ethylbutyrateEMI3.1 t hexyl peroxy C 3M7 CH3 CH3 CH3 C 3M7 2 methylpentanoate Examples of disecondary peroxy esters of Formula II are Name R5 R6 R7 R8 R9 2,5 di 2 ethyl CH2 CH2 C2H5 C4H9 C2H5 C4H9 hexanoylperoxy 2,5 dimethyl hexane 2,5 di 2 methyl CH2 CH2 CH3 C4H9 CH3 C4H9 hexanoylperoxy 2,5 dimethylhexane 2,5 di 2 ethyl C C C2H5 C4H9 C2h5 C4H9 hexanoylperoxy 2 5 4 9 2 5 C4H9 2,5 dimethylhexyne 3 In accordance with the known methods, one or more of these peroxy esters is used in combination with a high temperature peroxy initiator to promote the polymerization or copolymerization of p methylstyrene. The terms low temperature initiator11 and high temperature initiator11 are used herein in accordance with their accepted meanings in the free radical literature.The temperature characteristic of each is conveniently expressed in terms of the ten hour half life temperature, i.e., the temperature at which the initiator is 50 decomposed in ten hours. Low temperature initiators are generally those whose ten hour half life temperatures are below 900C, preferably for purposes of the present invention from about 600C to about 800 C, as determined in benzene. High temperature initiators are generally those whose ten hour half life temperatures are about 900C or above, preferably from about 900C to about 1200 C, in the same solvent. The high temperature initiators used in conjunction with the low temperature initiators of FormulaeI and II above are not critical. Indeed, the unusual results attainable according to the present invention are achieved using a wide variety of species as the high temperature peroxides, including both monofunctional and difunctional species. The various types suitable for use include t alkyl peroxybenzoates, t alkyl diperoxybenzoates, t alkyl peroxycarbonates and di t alkylperoxy ketals.Specific examples are t Butyl peroxybenzoate t Butyl peroxy 2 methylbenzoate t Amyl peroxy 2 methylbenzoate t Butyl peroxy 2 ethylhexylcarbonate t Amyl peroxy 2 ethylhexylcarbonate 2, 5 Dimethyl 2, 5 di benzoylperoxy hexane 1, 1 Di t butylperoxy cyclohexane t Butyl peroxyacetate t Amyl peroxyisononoate t Butyl peroxyisopropylcarbonate t Butyl peroxy n octylcarbonate Preferred high temperature initiators are t alkyl peroxybenzoates and t alkyl diperoxybenzoates. The remaining process parameters are generally in accord with the prior art. The ratio of high temperature to low temperature initiators, for example, is not critical and may vary, although for most applications a ratio in the range of about 0.2 to about 5.0 high to low , determined on the basis of moles of peroxy functional group, will provide the best results. The preferred range is from about 0.5 to about 2.0. Similarly, the amounts of each initiator may vary, with amounts in the range of from about 0.5 x10 4to about 30x10 4moles of peroxy functional group per 100 grams of p methylstyrene, preferably from about 2x10 4to about 15x10 4moles per 100 grams, providing the best results. During polymerization, the reaction mixture is generally in the form of a suspension in water, aided by a suspending agent and surfactant as well as additional additives commonly used in this and similar reactions. The reaction temperature is not critical, although in most cases it lies within the range of about 800C to about 1500C, preferably from about 900C to about 1300C. While the present invention is applicable to both homopolymerization and copolyfaerization of p methylstyrene, homopolymerization is preferred. Small amounts of other methylstyrene isomers may be present in the monomer mixture. EXAMPLE 1 Pop bottles of 6.5 ounce 192 milliliter capacity were charged with 50g each of a suspension solution consisting of 0.004g surfactant Dow 2A1, DowChemical Co., Midland, Michigan , 0.0255g Na2CO3, 0.398gNa3PO4, and 2.0g 17.7 CaCl2, with water as the balance.To each suspension solution was added 25g p methylstyrene monomer Mobil Chemical Co., Petrochemicals Div., New York, New York including a dual initiator system. A variety of initiator combinations were used, the low temperature initiator in some of the combinations being benzoyl peroxide and in others either t butylperoxy 2ethylhexanoate or 2,5 dimethyl 2,5 di 2 ethylhexanoyl roxy hexane, the latter two initiators being within the scope of the present invention. The amount of each initiator used, both high and low temperature, was 9.0t10 4 moles per 100g of monomer for monofunctional peroxy compounds and 4.54x1O4rroles per 100 g of monomer for difunctional peroxy compounds. The bottles were flushed with nitrogen, capped and rotated in a 100 C bath for the desired polymerization time, then cooled, acidified, filtered, washed and dried at 500C for two hours. Residual monomer was determined by gas liquid chromatography on a Hewlett Packard 5830A gas chromatograph with a 10 foot by 1 8 inch column packed with 15 QF l and 3 XE 60 on Chromosorb W. The sample was prepared by dissolving lg of polymer and 0.05g of t butyl benzene an internal standard in 20ml of benzene. The oven temperature was 1000 C. Polymerization time to 99 conversion was determined by interpolating the results of residual monomer analysis from bottles pulled from the bath at several different times. The sample chosen for molecular weight measurements was that closest to 99.5 conversion. The weight average molecular weight, Mw, and the number average molecular weight, Mn, were determined by gel permeation chromatography on a Varian 5000 liquid chromatograph. Two 30 cm columns, 4000H and GMH6 TSK Alltech Associates , were used, with tetrahydrofuran as solvent and polystyrene molecular weight standards. The results are shown in Table I.

These trends are all consistent in each of the direct comparisons, and generally evident in the comparisons where different high temperature initiators were used, particularly in the molecular weight figures. EXAMPLE 2 To further demonstrate the surprising nature of the present invention, the following data on styrene polymerization is presented. Polymerization of styrene has been more widely investigated than p methylstyrene polymerization. Due to their structural similarity, one would expect the two monomers to behave similarly in the presence of free radical initiators. The following demonstrates the contrary. The procedure of Example 1 was followed using, however, freshly distilled styrene in place of p methylstyrene. A range of initiator combinations similar to that used in Example 1 was used, although in lesser amounts 4.12x10 4moles of each per 100g of monomer for monofunctional peroxy compounds and 2.0g10 moles per 100g for difunctional peroxy compounds. The results are shown in Table II.

The uniqueness of these low temperature initiators in connection with p methylstyrene polymerization is thus even more unexpected.
