A coating composition is provided. The coating com position is a curable blend of ethylenically unsaturated polyester and ethylenically unsaturated thermoplastic polymers. The composition is capable of providing a thermo plastic, soluble, sandable, intermediate stage coating and, when cured, a final stage coating which is unaffected by acetone placed on the final stage coating for two hours at 22 C, has a percent haze value of 15 or less, and is unaffected when subjected to a Wet Print Test.
