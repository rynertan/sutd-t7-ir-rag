# Improved nitrogen injector system.

## Abstract
A nitrogen injector system is provided including a nitro gen injector unit. The nitrogen injector unit includes liquid ni trogen with a head space having gaseous nitrogen at a pres sure exceeding atmospheric pressure. An injector orifice 76 is provided, as is a distributing disk 78 which normally closes that orifice. The distributing disk is provided with metering ap ertures 82 for receiving metered amounts of liquid nitrogen from a nitrogen receptacle and transporting those metered amounts to a position adjacent the injector orifice and for opening the orifice when the metered amount is in the requi site position. The pressure of nitrogen gas within the head space is utilized to elect the metered amount from the meter ing aperture into a container 34 located at the dispensing po sition. Containers are advanced to the dispensing position on a container conveyor. The distributing disk is rotated at a speed proportional to the speed of the container conveyor with a common drive such that a requisite amount of nitrogen will be dispensed to each container regardless of fluctuations in the speed of the con veyor. A solenoid 52 is provided for selectively disabling the ejection of liquid nitrogen by the disconnection of a gas dis charge conduit 84 which couples the injector orifice with the high pressure nitrogen gas within the head space.
