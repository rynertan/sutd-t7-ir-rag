# Urine collection device.

## Abstract
A mid stream urine collection device comprises a flat open topped tray like receptacle 1 having plastics film 2 wrapped around it under tension with edges secured together across the open top of the receptacle by an adhesive 4 which releases the edges when wetted by urine, so that the film then snaps away from the open top, diverting the first part of the urine stream from the receptacle and permitting the mid stream part to enter.
