# Non crystalline poly alpha olefin catalyst and method.

## Abstract
A process is provided for the preparation of non crys talline, hydrocarbon soluble ultra high molecular weight drag reducing polymers comprising preparing a transition metal catalyst slurry containing crystalline titanium halide, a hydrocarbon diluent and an ether, then contacting the transition metal catalyst slurry with an alkylating agent, having at least one available alkyl group, alkylate the tran sition metal catalyst slurry, before polymerizing alpha mo noolefinic hydrocarbons at a temperature of 40 F or less.
