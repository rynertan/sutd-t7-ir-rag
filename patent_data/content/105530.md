# Winding a package of tape.

## Abstract
Tape 11 is wound into a package by traversing the winding positiona long a cylindrical core 21 such that the winding position is intermittently and repeatedly halted at a plurality of positions arranged axially of the core 21 so that at each position the tape 11 is wound spirally following which the winding position is traversed to the next adjacent position. The spirals comprise at least one turn and more of the winding time is spent in forming sprirals than in traversing between spirals. The spacing between the posi tions is such that the spirals do not overlap and such that the gap between the spirals is less than the width of the tape 11 . The number of spirals wound at each position is insufficient to cause a step which interferes with traverse back to the position. Control of the traverse movement can be achieved either electronically by a pulse counter con nected to the package support shaft or electro magnetically by a control drum driven from the package support shaft.
