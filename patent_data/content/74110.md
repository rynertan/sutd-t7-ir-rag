# GRAPHIC READING

## Abstract
An original 1a is first illuminated with a light beam of white color or a wavelength adapted for reading of the original, and an optical image of the original is focused on a photosensitive drum 5 previously charged uniformly, to form an electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive drum. Thereafter, the photosensitive drum is scanned with a laser beam 16 , and a discharge current attendant on the scanning is detected and converted into an electric signal 22a representative of the optical image. Thus, a monochro matic laser can read graphic records of any color.
