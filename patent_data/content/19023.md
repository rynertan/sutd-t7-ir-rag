# Automatic bagging apparatus and method for automatically packing articles into a bag.

## Abstract
An automatic bagging apparatus for automatically packing articles into a bag 10 comprises a horizontally movable tray assembly A operable to transport and insert the articles towards the bag and a loader assembly D simultaneously movable together with the tray assembly A during the loading of the articles into the bag. When the loader D assembly is to be retracted leaving the articles inside the bag, the loader assembly D starts its return movement independently of and subsequent to the return of the tray assembly A . The bag is, after having been fed from at least one bag box E to a bag receptacle 89 , positioned frontwardly of the tray assembly and is completely opened by the application of at least one blow of compressed air in to the bag subsequent to the opening of the mouth of the bag. The loading of the articles into the bag is initiated after the bag has been so completely opened. The loaded bag is then erected by tilting it downards about the point of pivot located adjacent the mouth of the bag and then pivoting the same upwards about the point of pivot located adjacent the bottom thereof.
