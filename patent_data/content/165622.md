# Apparatus for use in fixation of animal heart valves.

## Abstract
An insert for use in restraining an animal heart valve against distortion during fixation comprises a tubular peripheral wall 37 open at both ends and defining a generally axial passage 39 . The peripheral wall 37 has three generally axially extending projections 41, 43, 45 . Each of the projections 41, 43, 45 terminates axially outwardly in a curved end surface as viewed in side elevation, and each adjacent pair of projections 41, 43, 45 is circumferentially spaced by a recess 47 . Each of the projections 41, 43, 45 has an outer tissue supporting surface 53, 55 closely adjacent its free end, the outer tissue supporting surface 53 of one of the projections 41 lying more radially outwardly of the axis of the passage 39 than the outer tissue supporting surfaces 55 of the other two projections 43, 45 so that the outer tissue supporting surfaces 53, 55 are arranged eccentrically about the axis of the passage 39 . At least the exposed surface of the insert 17 is constructed by a biocompatible material.
