# Method for producing thin silicone elastomeric films and the films produced thereby.

## Abstract
Silicone elastomeric films of 1 to 500 microns can be made by coating an addition curable or dehydrocondensa tion curable silicone elastomer composition on a coated paper which has a peeling resistance of no more than 50g cm, curing the composition, and then peeling the film from the coated paper. These thin silicone elastomeric films can be used for gas separation.
