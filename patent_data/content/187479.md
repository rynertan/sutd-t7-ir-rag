# EXTRACTION OF AROMATICS WITH ETHYL ACETOACETATE

## Abstract
This invention relates to an energy efficient process for the solvent extraction of aromatic hydrocarbons from hydro carbon streams containing the same, using as the solvent ethyl acetoacetate. This solvent may be recovered from the aromatics by cooling the aromatic solvent mixture, whereby separation takes place without distillation.
