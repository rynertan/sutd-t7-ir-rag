# THERMOSTATICALLY CONTROLLED PACK HOLD DOWN ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A filter assembly comprises a housing, a liquid inlet in said housing, a liquid outlet in said housing, a filter pack in said housing, and valve means in said housing which is opened, for bypassing liquid about the filter pack when the liquid is cold and viscous and which is closed when the liquid is warmed and less viscous so that all liquid will pass through the filter pack. The liquid inlet and liquid outlet are each provided with one way check valves for controlling liquid flow into and out of the housing. A flow control orifice is provided in the liquid inlet to reduce housing pressure, without affecting flow of liquid through the filter pack and to reduce the possibility of leaks from housings with worn parts.
