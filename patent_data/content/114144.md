# IMPROVED MOUNTING SYSTEMS FOR CYCLE WINDSHIELDS AND SIMILAR

## Abstract
There is disclosed a windshield mounting assembly for a motorcycle windshield or the like having, in combination, a clamp portion adapted to be snugly received over a portion of an associated cycle, the clamp portion also including means for positioning a portion of a windshield brace assem bly for rotation through a range of angular adjustment posi tions. There is also a shield brace assembly having one end portion adapted to be removably positioned with respect to the clamp to prevent radial movement of one brace end, and a fastener adapted to cooperate with the clamp in securing one brace end. The shield brace assembly further includes cooperating portions also arranged for movement through a range of adjustment positions, and means for locking the cooperating portions of the brace in a desired position of adjustment, one of the cooperating portions having means on a free end thereof for attachment to a portion of a cycle windshield. The one brace end and the clamp have interlock able means for preventing movement of the brace from a desired position of angular adjustment when the brace end and the clamp are fastened together. The fastener is also constructed and arranged for hand tightening so as to lock the brace end to the clamp in said desired position of angular adjustment.
