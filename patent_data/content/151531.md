# Passive pH adjustment of nuclear reactor containment flood water.

## Abstract
An arrangement for the passive adjustment of the pH of the liquid used to flood the containment structure of a nuclear reactor following an accident such as loss of primary or secondary coolant includes perforated containers or baskets, which contain a pH adjusting chemical which is soluble in the flooding liquid usually a slightly acidic solution of borated water and which chemical is covered with or encapsulated in a plastic protective material, which is likewise soluble in the flooding liquid, and which are located in the emergency containment sumps.
