# Transformer with ferromagnetic circuits of unequal saturation inductions.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a magnetic core for a transformer or the like, which core is made of different ferromagnetic mate rials. The core is a composite constructed of ferromagnetic cir cuits 22, 24 nested one within the other and comprising at least one circuit 22 formed of a grain oriented electrical steel, and at least one circuit 24 formed of a ferromagnetic amor phous material. Preferably, the circuit of grain oriented steel forms the inner loop and the circuit of amorphous material forms the outer loop in the composite core.
