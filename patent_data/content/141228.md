## Description
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates te a process for producing polychlorobenzonitrile having chlorine atoms at the 2,6position by ammoxydation of toluene derivative having chlorine atoms at the 2,6 position with a gas containing ammonia and oxygen in vapour phase in the presence of a catalyst, characterized in that bromine and or a bromine containing compound is added to the reaction system. The toluene derivative having chlorine atoms at the 2,6 position abbreviated as 2,6 DCT hereinafter include, for example, 2,6 dicholotoluene, 2,3,6 trichlorotoluene, and 2,4,6 trichlorotoluene. According to the process of this invention, they are converted into 2,6 dichlorobenzonitrile, 2,3,6 trichlorobenzonitrile, and 2,4,6 trichlorobenzonitrile, respectively. 2,6 Dichlorobenzonitrile which is obtained by ammoxydation of 2,6 dichlorotoluene is an effective weed killer per se, and it is also an important intermediate for agricultural chemicals and medicines. Ans recently there is an increasing demand for this compound. At present, this compound is an synthesized through a very complex route, and it is hoped that an economical process will be developed. Heretofore, there hace been proposed several processes for producing 2,6 dichlorobenzonitrile by ammoxydation of 2,6dichlorotoluene. The ammoxydation of 2,6 dichlorotoluene has a disadvantage in that it is necessary to jive oxygen and ammonia in large excess and to extend the reaction time, because the metLyl group to be oxidized is less active than that in other aromatic methyl compunds due to the presence of bulkyl chloride atoms at the both ortho positions. The maximum yield attained so far was 79 . Japanese Patent Publication No. 7902 1967 . The present inventors performed extensive studies on the improvement of yield and productivity in the production of polychlorobenzonitrile abbreviated as 2,6 DCflN hereinafter , having chlorine atoms at the 2,6 position as the substituents, by ammoxydation of 2,6 DCT. As the result, it was found that the ammoxydation of 2,6 DCT is improved in yield and performance regardless of the kind of catalyst system used and it is not necessary to use oxygen and ammonia in large excess, if bromine and or a bromine containing compound is added to the reaction system. The present invention was completed based on this finding. The process of this invention provides better yields than the conventional process in which a bromine compound is not added, regardless of the kind of catalyst system used. However, it is preferred to use a high performance catalyst system for the production of 2,6 DCBN. Examples of such catalyst system include V Fe catalyst as disclosed in Japanese Patent PublicationNo. 790211967, V catalyst and V Cr catalyst as disclosed inJapanese Patent Publication No. 10623 1968, and V P catalyst as disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid open No. 121738 1978 andUSP 4124631. To be concrete, the preferred catalyst is one which has the following composition. 1 V1Fe O wherein x and y denote the atomic ratio of iron and oxygen, x being 0.5 to 10 and y being a value which is determined according to the valence and atomic ratio of other elements. 2 V1PaAbOc a wherein A denotes at least one element selected from the group consisting of chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, and tin and a, b, and c denote the atomic ratio of phosphorus,A, and oxygen, respectively, a being 0.5 to 3, b being 0 to 2, and c being a value which is determined according to the valence and atomic ratio of other elements. 3 V1Cr 0 xy wherein x and y denote the atomic ratio of chromium and oxygen, x being 0.1 to 3.0, and y being a value which is determined according to the valence and atomic ratio of other elements. The scope of this invention is not restricted by these catalyst systems. Any icriown catalysts can be used in the process of this invention, and they can be produced according to the known processes. For example, a preferred catalyst may be produced by mixing the compounds of the constituting elements in the presence of water and evaporating the mixture to dryness, followed by calcination preferably at 400 to 650 cm The carrier such as alumina, silica, beryllia, magnesia, titania, silicon carbide, asbestos, and diatomaceous earth can be used. However, the carrier may not be required. The bromine containing compound used in the procMss num this irvention includes, for example, hydrogen bromide, methyl bromide, dibromomethane, bromoform, carbon tetra bromide, ethyl bromide, 1,2 dibromoethane, n propyl bromide, i propyl bromide, n butyl bromide, i butyl bromide, sec butyl bromide, i amyl bromide, sec amyl bromide, t amyl bromide, cyclopentyl bromide, cyclohexyl bromide, bromobenzenes, and bromotoluenes. In addi tion to these compunds, those bromine compounds which are a gas at the reaction temperature can be used. These bromine compounds is added in an amount of preferably 0.1 to 10 wt, more preferably 0.3 to 5 wt , based on the quantity of 2,6 DCT. The reaction conditions in the process of this invention varies depending on the catalyst used. Oxygen and ammonia is used each in an amount of preferably 2 to 5 mol for 1 mol of 2,6 DCT. The reaction temperattre in the process of this invention may be lower than that in other processes. The preferred reaction temperature is 330 to 450DC. The reaction can be performed under pressure, under normal pressure, or under reduced pressure. The process of this invention can be performed by using a fixed bed reactor or fluidized bed reactor. The invention is now described in more detail with reference to the following examples and comparative examples, which should not be construed to restrict the scope of this invention. The conversion yield1 and selectivity based on 2,6 DCT are defined as follows Conversion A B x 100 II where A number of moles of reacted 2,6 DCT, ma B number of moles of 2,6 DCT fed to the reaction zone. Yield c D x 100 where C number of moles of 2,6 DCBN obtained, and D number of moles of 2,6 DCT fed to the reaction zone. Selectivity E F x 100 where E number of moles of 2,6 DCBN obtained, and F number of moles of reacted 2,6 DCT.
