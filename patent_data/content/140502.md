# Improvements relating to smoke detection apparatus.

## Abstract
A light sensing apparatus comprising a solidstate photo cell 1 responsive to low levels of light connected to an impedance matching buffer stage 2 , a gain controlled amplifier stage 3 and an output amplifier stage 4 a gain control network 5 is controlled by a temperature sensor 6 for receiving an amplified signal from said output stage 4 the gain being adjusted to compensate for temperature dependance of the photocell signal.
