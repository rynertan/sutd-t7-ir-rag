# Method and equipment for separating iodine in solid form, from an acid mercury salt solution.

## Abstract
There ist described a method for separating iodine in solid form, from an acid mercury salt solution, which comprises subjecting said iodine containing mercury salt solution at a pH value between 2 and 8, at an electrolysis 1 for separating the mercury, and thereafter precipitating 2 from the resulting, substantially mercuryfree solution, the iodine in the form of a salt.
