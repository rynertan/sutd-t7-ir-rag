## Description
FURNITURE ELEMENT FURNITURE INCORPORATING IT This invention relates to improvements in and relating to elements used in the construction of furniture, and is more particularly but not exclusively related to such elements for office storage furniture, e.g. cupboards and filing cabinets. it also concerns furniture constructed or assembled using such elements. In the assembly of furniture, it is frequently necessary to fit a constructional element in such a way that it fits into a space between two surfaces which are fixed and spaced apart. Especially in the construction of office storage furniture, such an element must often be capable of being fitted in one of a number of alternative positions, depending on the precise use to which the article of furniture concerned is to be put. For example, a horizontal element for supporting a shelf or drawer or other internal storage fitting must often be capable of being fitted between two vertical spaced supports at a variety of different levels, depending on the number, spacing or size of the internal fittings that are to be incorporated.This horizontal element may for example carry a suspension slide, from which a storage fitting such as a roll out filing frame, roll out shelf, or roll out drawer may be suspended. With conventional constructions, it is difficult to provide an element which can exactly fit into a space between two members, and which can at the same time be easily and quickly fixed without special tools in one of a number of alternative positions. According to this invention we therefore provide a constructional element for an article of furniture to fit between spaced surfaces thereof, the element having fixing means at opposite ends to enable it to be attached to the two surfaces, a hinge between these two ends so that by folding the element about the hinge the distance between the fixing means can be altered, and means enabling the element to be locked against hingeing when the fixing means are a desired distance apart. We also provide an article of furniture assembled using one or more of such constructional elements. The element, which may be an elongated beam of channel cross section, is preferably provided with fixing lugs projecting from its ends and which can fit into corresponding slots on the surfaces of the two members between which it is to fit. The hinge is preferably at about the centre of the beam, and enables the beam to be at least partially folded from a configuration in which it is straight. The means enabling the beam to be locked against hingeing are preferably attachement means, at least one on either side of the hinge, to enable a rigid member to be attached to the said element so that it lies against it and locks it against hingeing.These attachments may, for example, be holes in one face of the member, to receive fixing lugs or the like on the rigid member. The rigid member may also serve as a functional member of the article of furniture. For example, it may be a slide for a drawer or a filing frame. We also provide an article of furniture, especially an article of office furniture, incorporating at least one element as defined above and fitted into a space between two other members. An item of office furniture i.e. a storage cupboard embodying the inRndkn will now de described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of the constructional element in accordance with the invention in a partefolded condition and a wall portion of the article of furniture to which it is about to be fitted. a Figure 2 shows in perspective the same element fitted to the same article of furniture, and a rigid member about to be fitted to the element, and Figure 3 shows in perspective the same element, article of furniture, and rigid member, all assembled together. A storage cupboard 1 includes a side wall panel 2 provided with end flanges 3, 4 forming spaced apart vertical members. The space between these members 3, 4 can be spanned by a hinged beam 5, which is the constructional element of the present invention. This beam 5, when fitted, is arranged to support a suspension slide 10 which can carry out a roll out drawer, shelf, or filing frame. The beam 5 has a front wall hinged along hinge line 6, and is provided at each end with a pair of vertically spaced lugs and parallel top and bottom walls cut away at 11 adjacent to the hinge line to permit limited hingeing thereabout, as shown in Figure 1, which lugs can fit into correspondingly spaced slots 8 in the vertical members 3 and 4.These vertical members include a row of such slots 8 evenly spaced apart so that each end of the beam 5 can be fixed to any desired pair of adjacent slots and so can be fixed between the vertical members 3 and 4 at a variety of different heights, to suit the exact use to which the cupboard is to be put. The suspension slide 10 includes a pair of spacedapart projecting lugs having downwardly hooked ends not shown and the beam 5 has on its front face two corresponding spaced apart openings 9 into which these lugs can be fitted. In use, the beam 5 is fitted in a horizontal position between the vertical members 3 and 4, by folding it about the hinge line 6 to the configuration shown in Figure 1 so that the overall length of the beam is shortened, thereby allowing the beam, including the projecting lugs 7, to be inserted between the members 3 and 4. The beam 5 is positioned so that the lugs 7 are aligned with the desired holes in the vertical members 3 and 4, and then straightened to the configuration shown in Figure 2 so that the lugs become inserted into the holes.The suspension slide 10 is then fitted to the beam 5 in the manner shown in Figure 3, the hooked lugs hooking into the openings 9 in the beam, and, being rigid, prevents any subsequent folding of the beam 5 about the hinge line 6, so that the beam 5 remains firmly fixed in the desired position between the vertical members 3 and 4. The suspension slide 10 thus constitutes the rigid element mentioned above. The opposite sii wall of the cupboard 1 is a mirrorimage of that illustrated and a second beam 5 carrying a second suspension slide 10 is fitted to that side wall and at the same height as that described above. These suspension slides are of conventional type and a fitting such as a roll out fitting frame, shelf, or drawer can be fitted in known manner to them. In order to change the position of the beams 5, for example if a different configuration of fittings is to be incorporated into the cupboard, each suspension slide 10 is disconnected from its assembled beam 5 so that the beam can then be folded again about the hinge line 6. Folding of the beam in this way enables the lugs 7 to be withdrawn from the holes 8, and the beam can then be moved vertically and the lugs refitted in different holes at the desired new height.The beam is then re straightened and the suspension slide 10 re fitted.
