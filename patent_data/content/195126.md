# Star branched polyamides and star branched polyamine derivates thereof.

## Abstract
A star comb branched polyamides having at least 3 branches emanating from the residue of a core compound pending from a substantially linear polymer backbone wherein each branch has a plurality of amide moieties in which each such amide moiety has its amide nitrogen in the chain of the branch and each such amide nitrogen bears a pendant carbonyl moiety, said amide moieties being hydro lyzable to form amine moieties without cleaving the chain of the branch. Star comb branched polyamides having good resistance to degradation upon exposure to shear are prepared by reacting polyvalent core compounds such as tribromoneopentyl alcohol with an oxazoline such as 2 ethyl 2 oxazoline to provide the desired polyamide. The polyamides are readily hydrolyzed with acid such as hydro chloric acid to form star comb branched polyamines. The polyamides and the polyamines are useful as viscosity enhancing agents in such applications as paints, mobility control agents and hydraulic fluids.
