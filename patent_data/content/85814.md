# Dual opposed seal ring coupling assembly.

## Abstract
In a fluid conveying coupling assembly of the type in which a pair of torsionally deflectable seal rings 20, 22 which establish a redundant seal between interconnected coupling structures 14, 16 , the seal rings are oriented and deflected in such a manner that they impose non cumulative radially directed forces on the interconnected structures 14, 16 .
