# A method of processing sulphur containing heavy oil.

## Abstract
A method of processing a sulfur containing heavy oil comprises catalytically cracking the heavy oil in a first zone 1 in the presence of fluidized catalyst particles containing about 30 to 60 wt Fe so as to convert the heavy oil to a light oil, deposit sulfur containing coke on the catalyst particles, and partially fix the decomposed sulfur compounds with reduced iron contained in the catalyst particles as iron suifide. In a second zone 2, the catalyst from the first zone 1 is contacted with an oxygen containing gas in an amount less than that theoretically required to effect partial combustion of the coke on the catalyst, reduce the iron in the catalyst, and fix the sulfur compounds contained in the coke as iron sulfide. In a third zone 3, the reduced catalyst from the second zone 2 is contacted with steam in a fluidized manner to produce hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide and convert the reduced iron and iron sulfide in the catalyst to iron oxides. The iron oxide containing catalyst obtained in the third zone 3 is recirculated into the second zone 2 to be reduced and part of the reduced state catalyst obtained in the second zone 2 is recirculated into the first zone 1.
