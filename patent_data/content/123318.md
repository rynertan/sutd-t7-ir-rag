## Description
Acicular Particulate Material Containing Iron Carbide The present invention relates to novel acicular particles, a process for producing the same and magnetic materials prepared from such particles. More particularly, the invention relates to an acicular particulate material containing iron carbide and having a high coercive force and orientation property in magnetic field. The invention also relates to a magnetic coating composition and magnetic recording medium containing the above magnetic materials Hitherto, acicular particles usually containing an iron oxide as the base are used for magnetic materials for magnetic recording. These particleshave a coercive force Hc of up to about 400 Oe. In recent years, however, there is a demand for magnetic materials of improved performance, j.e. enhanced coercive force which enables them to record signals at a higher density per unit volume of magnetic materials. Some materials already known and somehow meeting such demand include particulate metallic iron obtained by reducing an acicular iron oxide with hydrogen and a modified acicular particulate iron oxide with cobalt.The former, which is chemically so active as to be readily oxidized in the atmosphere, requires special care during manufacture, storage and transport, is therefore cumbersome to handle and is very expensive. The latter, which contains cobalt, is not only expensive but also cliemically and thermally unstable because the material has its coercive force varied with lapse of time and because the variation is promoted by changes in temperature. An object of the present invention is to provide acicular particles having a high coercive force and outstanding magnetic field orientation and a magnetic material containing such particles. Another object of the invention is to provide acicular particles which are chemically and thermally stable and easy to handle and a magnetic material containing such particles. Another object of the invention is to provide acicular particles which are inexpensive and easy to produce and a magnetic material containing such particles. Still another object of the invention is to provide a magnetic coating composition and magnetic recording medium containing the magnetic material. The above and other objects of the invention will become apparent from the following description. Thus, the present invention provides acicular particles containing iron carbide and a magnetic material comprising such particles. These acicular particles are prepared by contacting, for example, an acicular iron oxyhydroxide or acicular iron oxide with CO or with a mixture of CO and H2. Although iron carbide is known to be a magnetic material, the iron carbide is in the form of spherical particles which are in no way commercially feasible.U.S. Patent No. 3s572s993 discloses that iron carbonyl is brought into contact with CO or with a mixture of CO and H2 to obtain spherical iron carbide particles having an average diameter of about 0.005 to O. 1 CI m and usable as a magnetic recording material. Although having a relatively high coercive force of 500 to 700 Oe iHc , the material, which is inthe form of spherical particles, have no magnetic field orientation and is not suited to the production of magnetic recording media having a satisfactory square ratio Br Bm or The acicular particles of the present invention have the following characteristics. First, they have a high coercive force, for example, as much as 1000 O e. Second, they have magnetic field orientation, whereby the material is made to have a magnetic hysteresis curve of improved square ratio. Thus, the particles are useful for giving magnetic recording media having a high residual flux density. Third, they are stable chemically and thermally.Unlike metallic iron particles, the acicular particles of the present invention are free of oxidation by air and are chemically stable. Further unlike the iron oxide modified with cobalt, the acicular particles of the invention are free of variations with time and are much more stable in properties, e.g. coercive force.Accordingly the present particles are easy to handle, do not deteriorate during storage or transport and are expected to retain a stable quality when used as a recording material. Fourth, they are inexpensive. The acicular particles of the invention do not require special care in handling unlike acicular metallic iron particles and are therefore available at a low cost. Unlike the cobalt modified iron oxide, the present particles need not always contain expensive cobalt at an essential component. Fifth, they can be produced easily. For the preparation of the present material, acicular iron oxyhydroxide or acicular iron oxide, for example, can be brought into contact with CO under mild conditions such as a contact temperature of up to 400 C. Sixth, the acicular particles of the present invention produced from acicular iron oxyhydroxide or acicular iron oxide have a higher coercive force than an acicular iron oxide derived from such material, e.g.acicular Fe3O4, or acicular Fez03 compacted by reoxidizing the Fe304 . Thus, the present particulate material has improved magnetic characteristics over acicular iron oxides. The acicular particles of the invention are usually at least 3, preferably 3 to 20, in an average axial ratio long axis short axis or length width of primary particles and are usually up to 2 gm, preferably 0.1 to 2 rm, most preferably 0.1 to 1.0Am, in average particle size long axis or length . The term primary particles herein used refers to particles which can be recognized as such when observed under an electron microscope 3000 to 6000X .For example, Fig. 1, which is an electron photomicrograph 6000X showing the structure of acicular particles of the invention, reveals that bundles of fine slender particles lap over one another. The individual fine slender particles constituting each bundle are primary particles. The iron carbide contained in the acicualr particles of the invention is one of Fe5C2, Fe2C andFe20Cs Fe2.2C or a mixture of at least two of these iron carbides. I t is suitable to represent the iron carbide as F ex C 2 x 3 . G Generally the presence of an iron carbide in a material can be detected by examining the X ray diffraction pattern of the material with reference to the known X ray diffraction patterns of the known iron carbides represented by chemical formulae e.g. those on X Ray Powder Data File ofASTM .However, since the difference in X ray diffraction pattern betweenindividual iron carbides is very small, an iron carbide as the main component can be identified but it is almost impossible to identify other iron carbides which are present in very small amounts although the very small amounts of iron carbides present do not influence the magnetic characteristics, etc. and may be neglected. Preferably the main iron carbide is one exhibiting plane spacings D values anespacings D values at 2.28 , 2.20 , Z.08A, 2.05 and 1.92 in the X ray diffraction pattern. Such ironcarbide corresponds to Fe5C2. This iron carbide is sometimes present conjointly with Fe2C, Fe20Cs Fe2. 2C , Fe3 C, etc. Preferably, the acicular particles of the invention contain at least 20wt. of iron carbide, then they have a coercive force of at least 450 Oe. More preferably, the acicualr particles of the invention contain at least 50wt. of iron carbide, then they have a coercive force of at least 850 Oe As already stated, it is almost impossible to identify all the iron carbides contained in the present particles, and it is also generally impossible to isolate these iron carbides. For the determination of the iron carbide content, therefore, the chemical formula of the iron carbide which can be identified as the main component is determined, and when required, the chemical formulae of other components are determined, for example, as Foe304, etc.The content is generally determined in view of these formulae, the result of elementary analysis and the weight gain on ignition. The acicular particles of this invention include those composed only of iron carbide s and those further containing other components. The components other than iron carbides are those derived from the starting material, such as iron oxide, those resulting from the production process, such as elemental carbon, and others derived from additives, such as carbides or oxides of copper, magnesium, manganese, nickel, cobalt and the like, carbonates or oxides of potassium, sodium and the like and or oxides of silicon and the like. Preferably the acicular particles of the present invention is produced by contacting an acicular iron oxyhydroxide or acicular iron oxide with CO or with a mixture of CO and H 2. The starting acicular iron oxyhydroxides or acicular iron oxides can be those usually at least 3 preferably 3 to 201 in average axial ratio and having an average particle size long axis of usually at least 2 this preferably 0.1 to 2 Fm, most preferably 0.1 to 1.0 m. As will be described later, the acicular particles produced are slightly smaller than, but almost unchanged from, the starting material in average axial ratio and inaverage particle size, so that the acicular particles of the invention in general preferably have such sizes as already stated. Examples of preferred acicular iron oxyhydroxides are acicular alpha FeOOH goethite , ss FeOOH akaganite and acicular 7 FeOOH lepidocrosite . Examples of preferred acicular iron oxides are acicular alpha Fe2O3 hematite , acicular 7 Fe203 maghemite and acicular Fe O magnetite . Acicular alpha Fe2O3 or acicular Y Fe203 is, for example, any of one prepared by heating acicular alpha FeOOH or acicular gamma 7 FeOOH. at about 200 to about 350 C, followed by dehydration, acicular alpha Fe2O3 prepared by heating the resulting product further at about 350 to about 900 C to compact the crystals, and others. The above mentioned acicular Fe3O4 can be prepared by contacting an acicular iron oxide other than acicular Fe3O4 or acicular iron oxyhydroxide with CO, H2 or a mixture thereof, although the Fe3O4 is not limited to one prepared in those methods. When CO or a mixture of CO and H2 is contacted with an acicular iron oxyhydroxide or acicular iron oxide other than acicular Foe304 to prepare acicular Foe304, the same contact conditions as those in the preferred production process of the invention can also be employed except for the time condition. In this case, the acicular Foe304 formed can be subsequently held in contact with thegas under the same conditions as in the preceding reaction without any interruption to obtain the desired acicular particulate material of the invention. The starting material to be used for the preferred process for producing acicular particles according to the invention may have added thereto a small amount or small amounts of a compound, such as oxide or carbonate of copper, magnesium, manganese, nickel or cobalt, silicon oxide, potassium salt, sodium salt, etc., insofar as the starting material is acicular and chiefly comprises an iron oxyhydroxide or iron oxide. The starting acicular iron oxyhydroxide or iron oxide preferably has a pH of at least 5 on the surface thereof. In this case are produced acicular particles having a higher coercive force. The acicular iron oxyhydroxide and iron oxide are preferable insofar as they have a pH of the above range, without regard to methods of preparation thereof. Thus, the starting iron compound having a pH of at least 5 just after the preparation can be used. Also, the starting material having a pH of less than 5 can be used after it is increased to at least 5 in pH by contact with an aqueous solution of an alkali compound eg, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide . The pH is measured in a usual method of measuring pH of solid surface.For example, one of methods is described on page 159 of coating and Pigment published by Nikkan Kogyo Sinbun sha. Specifically stated, 5g of the starting iron compound is boiled in 100cue of distilled water for one hour, the mixture is cooled to room temperature and allowed to place for one hour. The pH of a supernatant layer is measured by a pH meter. CO or a mixture thereof with H2 can be used as it is or as diluted. Examples of diluents are N 2s CO2, argon, helium, etc. When the mixture of CO andH2 is used, the mixing ratio CO H2 is preferably 1 0.05 to 1 5 by volume. The dilution ratio is preferably about 1.1 to about 10 times by volume . The contact temperature, contact time, flow rate of CO or mixture thereof with H2 and other conditions depend, for example, on the production history, average axial ratio, average particle size and specific surface area of the acicular iron oxyhydroxide or acicular iron oxide, dilution ratio of CO or mixture thereof, etc.The preferred contact temperature is about 250 to about 400 C, preferably about 300 to about 400 C. The preferred contact time is about 1 to about 10 hours for acicular Fe304. The Fe304 prepared from other acicular iron oxide or acicular iron oxyhydroxide by reduction is preferably further heated for about 1 to about 10 hours. The preferred flow rate ofCO or mixture thereof with H 2 is about 1 to about 1000ml S.T.P. min per gram of acicular iron oxyhydroxide or like starting material. When diluted CO or mixture thereof with H2 is used, the contact pressure inclusive of that of the diluent is usually 1 to 2 atom. although not limitative particularly. The particulate material obtained by the preferred production process are in the form of generally uniform acicular particles as seen in Fig. 1 when observed under an electron microscope. The particles are present as primary particles and have the same acicular particulate form as the starting particles of acicular iron oxyhydroxide or acicular iron oxide. The acicular particles obtained by the preferred process are found to contain carbon by elementary analysis and to contain an iron carbide by its X ray diffraction pattern, which exhibits plane spacings at 2.28wiz Z.2OA, 2.08A, Z.O5A and 1.92A.Such pattern corresponds to Fisc2. The iron carbide component of the present material chiefly comprises FesC2, with Fe2C, Fe20C9 Fe2.2C , Fe3C, etc.present conjointly therewith in some cases. I n the event of incomplete carbonization, the acicular particles obtained by the preferred process further contain an iron oxide component which is chiefly Fe3O4. With respect to iron oxides, FeO, FesOs and r Fe2O3 are generally related to one another in structure The oxygen atoms in these three oxides are packed in a three dimensional structure to the highest possible density and the number of oxygen atoms in Fe304 actually present varies in an overall range covering the numbers of oxygen atoms in these oxides, so that it is suitable to represent the iron oxide in the acicular particles byFeOy 1 y 1.5 . While the acicular particles prepared by the preferred process contain iron oxide in addition to the iron carbide component in most cases, the elementary analysis values of Css H and N indicate that the amount of carbon is usually excess of that calculated from the chemical formula of the iron carbide identified by the X ray diffraction pattern It is not clear whether the excess of carbon is present as combined with iron or as free carbon. In this sense, it is probable that the acicular particles obtained by the preferred process contain elemental carbon. The particles obtained by the preferredprocess then include acicular particles at least 3 in average axial ratio with respect to their shape as primary particles and composed substantially of iron carbide alone or iron carbide and iron oxide and or elemental carbon. The iron carbide and iron oxide contents of the acicular particles obtained by the preferred process can be determined from the chemical formulae Fe5C2 and Fe O , which are confirmed as the main iron carbide and iron oxide components by X ray diffraction analysis, the result of elementary analysis and the weight gain on ignition. The iron carbide content is preferably at least 20wt , more preferably at least 50wt . The iron oxide content is preferably up to 7Owt , more preferably up to 40wt . The acicular particles obtained by the preferred process are slightly smaller than but almost the same as the starting particles, namely acicular iron oxyhydroxide or acicular iron oxide, in average axial ratio and average particle size. Accordingly the acicular particles prepared by the present process have an average axial ratio usually of at least 3, preferably 3 to 20, and an average particle size long axis usually of up to 2 m, preferably 0.1 to 2 Aim2 most preferably 0.1 to 1.0 CI gl. The acicular particles obtained by the preferred process are formed by a solid vapor reaction wherein an acicular iron oxyhydroxide or a acicular iron oxide is brought into uniform contact with CO or a mixture thereof with H2. Further, the acicular particles formed have nearly the same shape as the acicular starting materialTherefore, in case of containing iron oxide, it appears that the iron carbide or the iron carbide and elemental carbon in the product are wholly or predominantly present on the surfaces of the particles and that the iron oxide is wholly or predominantly present in the interior of the particles. While acicular particles of the invention containing iron carbide have a high coercive force and magnetic field orientation, it is more preferable to treat the surface thereof with a surface treating agent to improve square ratio. Examples of surface treating agents are as follows 1 silane coupling agents such as r amino propyltriethoxysilane, N fl aminoethyl aminopropyltrimethoxysi lane, gamma ureidopropyltriethoxysilane, gamma glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, fl 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl ethyltrimethylsilane, ss methacryloyloxypropyltrimethoxysilane, gamma mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane, gamma chloropropyltrimethoxy silane, vinyltri ss methoxyethoxy silane, vinyltriethoxysilane, vinyltrichlorosilane, vinyltriacetoxysilane, etc. 2 long chain organic carboxylic acids or salts thereof such as oleic acid, coconut oil fatty acid and like aliphatic fatty acid having 12 to 20 carbon atoms alkali metal Na, K, NHs etc salts thereof, alkali earth metal calcium, magnesium, etc salts thereof, etc. 3 phosphates such as lecithin, GAFAK a product of Toho Chemical Co., Ltd. , etc. 4 sorbitan fatty acid esters such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monostearate, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate, etc. 5 organic sulfonates such as sodium dialkylsulfosuccinate, sodium alkylbenzenesulfonate, etc. Acicular particles of the invention can be treated with the surface treating agent in a suitable manner. For example, the present particles containing iron carbide are dispersed in a solvent in an amount of up to 10 by weight and a predetermined amount of the surface treating agent is added to the dispersion with stirring to obtain a layer coated with the agent on the particle surface. In another manner, a solution of the surface treating agent can be sprayed to form a coated layer on the particle surface. The amount of the surface treating agent is preferably about 0.01 to about by by weight based on the weight of acicular particles containing iron carbide.When the amount is in this range, the effect is highly achieved and the surface treating agent does not flow out to magnetic recording media, causing no or little disadvantages on the characteristics of the media. While the present acicular particles containing iron carbide have a high coercive force and magnetic field orientation, it is still preferable to incorporate a sintering preventing agent in acicular particles to improve a coercive force. Acicular particles containing a sintering preventing agent can be prepared by coating acicular iron oxyhydroxide with a sintering preventing agent and contacting the coated iron oxyhydroxide after dehydrated or without dehydration with CO or a mixture thereof with H 2. As sintering preventing agents, any of compounds can be used which is conventionally employed to prevent sintering for the starting acicular iron oxyhydroxide in the preparation of acicular r Fe20 3. Examples thereof are silicone compound, beron compound, aluminum compound, aliphatic carboxylic acid or salt thereof, phosphorus compound, titanium compound, etc. Preferable examples of silicone compounds are water glass, silane coupling agent, etc. Examples of silane coupling agent are, for example, compounds represented by the general formula R Si X3 n Yn wherein R is vinyl group or alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms and having at least one atom or group selected from the group consisting of chlorine atom, amino, aminoalkyl, ureido, glycidoxy, epoxycyclohexyl, acryloyloxy, methacryloyloxy, mercapto and vinyl groups X and Y are respectively chlorine atom, hydroxyl, C1 C10 alkoxyl, C 2 alkoxy substituted alkoxyl, C2 C4 hydroxyalkoxyl or Cz C15 acyloxy n is zero or an integer of 1 or 2. R is an alkyl group having a functional substituent. Preferable examples of group R are P aminoethyl, 7 aminopropyl, N ss aminoethyl gamma aminopropyl, gamma uneidopropyl, 7 glycidoxypropyl, 3,4 epoxycyclohexyl ethyl, z 7 acryloyloxypropyl, gamma methacryloyloxypropyl, 7 mercaptopropyl, fi chloroethyl, 7 chloropropyl, gamma vinylpropyl, etc. R may be vinyl. Examples of the silane coupling agents are same as used in the aforementioned surface treating agent. Preferred examples of the boron compounds are those containing boron in the molecule in a specific form such as compounds obtained by reacting boric acid and glycerin and like polyvalent alcohol having adjacent hydroxyl 1 groups. Examples of such compounds are polyoxyethylene glycerol borate laurate, polyoxyethylene glycerol borate palmitate, polyoxyethylene glycerol borate stearate, etc. Preferable examples of aluminum compounds are potassium aluminate, sodium aluminate, etc. Preferred examples of aliphatic carboxylic acids and salts thereof are oleic acid, coconut oil fatty acid and like aliphatic fatty cid having 12 to 20 carbon atoms alkali metal Na, K, etc salts thereof, alkali earth metal calcium, magnesium, etc salts thereof, ammonium salt thereof, etc. Preferable examples of phosphorus compounds are phosphoric esters, phosphates, etc. Examples of the former are alkylphenol type phosphoric ester, alkylphosphoric ester CGAFAK series, a product ofToho Chemical Co., Lid. , etc. Examples of the latter are sodium hexametaphosphate, sodium pyrophosphate, sodium metaphosphate, etc. Preferred examples of titanium compounds are organic titanium compound having a portion bonded to inorganic part and a portion bonded to organic part.Examples of such compounds are diisopropoxy bis acetylacetone titanate, di n butoxy bis triethanolamine titanate, dihydroxy bis lactic amide titanate, tetraoctylene glycol titanate, etc. The sintering preventing agent prevents particles from adhering each other. I t can be used singly or in mixture. The amount to be coated on the surface of the starting iron compound varies depending on kinds of the agent, but is preferably about 0.01 to about 0.5 by weight based on the weight of the starting iron compound. With the coated amount in this range, excellent coercive force can be obtained. The coating may be conducted in a usual manner. Generally, acicular particles of the starting iron compound are dispersed in an aqueous solution of the sintering preventing agent having a suitable concentration, the dispersion, when required, is adjusted in pH and the particles are filtered and dried. The acicular iron oxyhydroxide thus obtained and having a layer of the sintering preventing agent on the surface is brought into contact with CO or a mixture thereof with H2. The coated acicular iron oxyhydroxide is subjected to the contact reaction as it is, or as changed into a Fe2O3 or y Fe203 by heating at about 200 to about 350C, followed by dehydration, or as changed into a Fe203 having more compact crystal structure by heating the above a Fe2O3 or 7 Fe2O3 at about 350 to 900 C. The acicular particles thus obtained are acicular particles containing iron carbide which contains sintering preventing agent Iron carbide is confirmed by comparing the X ray di f fraction pattern of the product with that of iron carbide containing no sintering preventing agent.The acicular particles exhibit higher coercive force than those obtained from the starting iron compound contai ning no sintering preventing agent. The acicular particles contain similar amount of iron carbide, since there is mere difference in which the starting acicular iron oxyhydroxide is coated with sintering preventing agent or not. The sintering preventing agent includes derivativges thereof derived from the contact reaction of GO or a mixture thereof with H2 and acicular iron oxyhydroxide coated with sintering preventing agent with or without dehydration.The derivatives are presumed to be composed of metal, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, oxides or halogenides of non metal other than halogen, or inorganic compounds derived from these. S ince the acicular particles containing iron carbide which contains the sintering preventing agent have higher coercive force, it is presumed that the agent is coated on the particle surface, which prevents the destruction of acicular form and sintering of particles when heated. The amount of the sintering preventing agent after the contact reaction may vary depending on iron carbide content, kinds of the agent used, but is preferably about 0.015 to 0.7 by weight of the acicular particles obtained. The acicular particles contain a little amount of the sintering preventing agent but have a higher coercive force. Thus, the particles have a similar shape and composition to those containing no sintering preventing agent, apart form coercive force and like magnetic characteristics. The acicular particles of the present invention containing iron carbide are useful as a magnetic material for magnetic recording as is apparent from the foregoing characteristics, etc., while the use thereof is not limited thereto. For example, the acicular particulate material is usable as a catalyst for preparing lower aliphatic hydrocarbons from GO and H2. The present invention provides a magnetic coating composition comprising the present acicular particles containing iron carbide and a binder containing a film forming resin as a main component. The magnetic coating composition can be prepared by a known method and is obtained for example by dispersing the above acicular particles in an organic solvent together with a binder. To the composition are added, as required, a dispersing agent, lubricant, abrasive, antistatic agent and like additives. The organic solvents include ketones such as a cetone, methyl ethyl I ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol esters such as ethyl acetate, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, ethyl lactate and glycol monoethyl ether acetate ethers such as ether, glycol dimethyl ether, glycol monoethyl ether and dioxane aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and xylene chlorinated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, ethylene chloride, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, ethylene chiorohydrin and dichlorobenzene, and the like.

Suitable thermosetting resins or reaction type resins have a molecular weight of about 200,000 or less as a coating solution, and when heated after coating and drying, the molecular weight becomes infinite due to reactions such as condensation, addition, and the li ke. Of these resins, preferred resins, are those resins which do not soften or melt before the resin thermally decomposes. Representative examples of these resins are a phenol resin, an epoxy resin, a polyurethane hardening type resin, a urea resin, a melamine resin, an alkyl resin, a silicone resin, an acryl based reactive resin, an epoxy polyamide resin, a mixture of a high molecular weight polyester resin and an isocyanate prepolymer, a mixture of a methacrylic acid copolymer and a diisocyanate prepolymer, a mixture of a polyester polyol and a polyisocyanate, a urea formaldehyde resin, a mixture of a low molecular weight glycol, a high molecular weight diol and triphenylmethane triisocyanate, a polyamine resin, and mixtures thereof, etc. These binders can be used singly or in mixture, and the additives can be added to the binders.The binders are used in an amount of preferably 10 to 400 parts by weight, more preferably 30 to 200 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the acicular particles.

The abrasives used include those which are generally used, such as fused alumina, silicon carbide, chromium oxide, corundum, artificial corundum, diamond, artificial diamond, garnet and emery main components corundum and magnetite . The average particle diameter of these abrasives is 0.05 to 5 Aim, m preferably 0.1 to 2 Aim These abrasives are added in an amount of 7 to 20 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the binder.

Coercive force H c, residual flux density Br and saturation flux density Bm are measured in a magnetic field with a strength of 5 kOe, using a gauss meter equipped with a Hall effect element and the sample with a packing ratio of 0.2. 2 Elementary analysis for C, H and N The sample is subjected to elementary analysis in the conventional method using NTZ CHN CORDER Yanaco, product of Yanagimoto Mfg. Co., Ltd, with passage of oxygen helium carrier at SOOC 3 Determination of composition The composition of the product is calculated from the chemical formulae of iron oxide and iron carbide determined by X ray diffractiometry, the elementary analysis value of C and the weight gain resulting from the following heat treatment. The calculation is conducted on the basis that Fe304, for example, changes into Fe203 having 1.035 times the weight of the former oxide and that Fe5C2 changes into Fe203 having 1.317 times the weight of the carbide. The weight gain is determined in the conventional method of heat treatment, i.e. by placing the sample in a platinum crucible, then heating the sample in a muffle furnace at 6000 for 1 hour in the air and measuring the resulting weight gain after ascertaining the presence of a Fe203 by X ray diffraction. Stated more specifically, it is assumed that the proportions of Fe5C2, Fe304 and elemental carbon are x, y and z wt , respectively, and that the carbon analysis value and the weight gain are A and B wt , respectively. The values x, y and z are then given by the following equations. x y z 100 1.317x 1.035y 100 B z 0.079x A Fig. 1 is an electron photomicrograph showing the structure of acicular particles of the invention Figs. 2 to 6 show X ray diffraction pattern of acicular particles obtained in Examples 112, 4, and 5 to 7.
