## Description
This application relates to improved polymer blends of olefin polymer and nitrile rubber, and in particular, blends of enhanced compatibility due to the presence of a block copolymer comprising nitrile rubber compatibilizing segments and olefin polymer compatibilizing segments. Blends of olefin polymer and nitrile rubber are known. For example, see US A 3,909,463 and US A 4,104,210. Olefin polymers and nitrile rubber are largely incompatible with one another. Mutual incompatibility prevents the development of optimum properties in blends of these materials. Thus, if the compatibility of the blend components can be increased, improved blends may be obtained. This is because particles of one or another component in the blend will be smaller and less likely to act as flaws. It has now been discovered that an improved composition comprises a blend of 25 to 65 parts by weight of polypropylene and 75 to 35 parts by weight of cured nitrile rubber having an average molecular weight of 50,000 or more per 100 parts combined weight of polypropylene and cured nitrile rubber, the cured nitrile rubber being present in the form of small particles having a size of 50 micrometers or less dispersed throughout the polypropylene, and, in an amount of at least 0,1 percent by weight of the composition, a block copolymer comprising at least one nitrile rubber compatibilizing segment and at least one polypropylene compatibilizing segment, the said block copolymer being derived from a polypropylene containing one or more graft forming functional groups. The term block copolymer means a material in which olefin polymer compatibilizing molecular segments and nitrile rubber compatibilizing molecular segments are chemically linked to one another. Examples of olefin compatibilizing segments are polybutadiene, polyisoprene, and polyalkenamer, as well as the olefin polymers themselves. Examples of nitrile rubber compatibilizing segments are epichlorohydrin polymer, polyamide, polyamine, acrylic polymer, and polyester, as well as nitrile rubber itself. Compatibilizing segments have chemical or physical affinity for olefin polymer or nitrile rubber. The compatibilizing block copolymer has affinity for both the olefin polymer and the nitrile rubber and its presence improves the compatibility between olefin polymer and nitrile rubber. Any thermoplastic uncross linked block copolymer of nitrile rubber and olefin polymer is suitable for preparing the improved compatibilized blends of the invention. A block copolymer may be prepared by causing a reaction to form a bond between the olefin polymer containing one or more graft forming functional groups and nitrile rubber. Preferably, only one bond is formed for each olefin polymer molecule and nitrile rubber molecule. Block copolymers containing more than one bond per molecule are satisfactory but it is preferred that the number of bonds is not so high that the resulting copolymer is in the form of a network molecular structure and is not longer thermoplastic. One embodiment of the invention relates to an especially effective class of block copolymers prepared from an olefin polymer containing one or more graft forming functional groups and nitrile rubber. More preferred block copolymers are prepared from olefin polymer and nitrile rubber each of which contain graft forming functional groups. Usually the graft forming functional groups of the olefin polymer are different from those of the nitrile rubber. Examples of satisfactory functional groups are carboxy , halo preferably, chloro or bromo , amino , groups derived from methylol phenolic material, hydroxy groups, epoxy groups, and sulfonyl, sulfonic acid or salt groups. Functional olefin polymer and functional nitrile rubber may be prepared by known techniques and some of these materials are commonly available. For example, functional groups may be provided during polymerization by copolymerizing an olefin and an unsaturated carboxylic acid. Alternatively, functional groups may be introduced by direct reaction with the polymer by known grafting reactions. The functional groups may react directly to form a block copolymer between the olefin polymer and nitrile rubber. When the graft forming functional groups are such that this does not occur, it may be necessary to provide another reactant in order to form a block copolymer. For example, when the functional groups of the polyolefin and nitrile rubber are carboxy, a polyfunctional reactant such as a polyamine may react with the carboxy groups to form a block copolymer. Functionalized liquid nitrile rubbers having a molecular weight of 500 to 50,000, preferably 800 to 10,000, are especially eferred block copolymer precursors. Block copolymers which are derived from methylolphenolic modified olefin polymer or maleic modified olefin polymer and nitrile rubber containing amino groups are especially preferred. Olefin polymer molecules are generally functionalized before they interact with nitrile rubber molecules. This is because functionalizing agents can generally react far more rapidly with rubber molecules than with molecules of olefin polymer. In the presence of comparable amounts of both olefin polymer and rubber, functionalizing agent could be depleted without enough reaction with olefin polymer it could be used up by reaction with essentially only the rubber. In addition, some functionalizing agents such as dimethylol phenolic derivatives are highly active rubber curatives. Such agents would more likely gel the rubber than functionalize the olefin polymer further, gelled rubber, even though it might become chemically bound to olefin polymer molecules, may not form a compatibilizing block polymer. To insure that reaction occurs between functionalizing agent and olefin polymer, it is frequently advisable, and sometimes essential, that the olefin polymer be functionalized in the absence of rubber, before admixture with rubber in a later portion of the procedure. For example, olefin polymers should be functionalized by dimethylol phenolic derivatives in the absence of the usual types of high molecular weight nitrile rubber. However, an olefin copolymer can be functionalized in the presence of a relatively small amount of a preferably low molecular weight liquid nitrile rubber by the action of a highly active curative such as a peroxide. Here, molecules of a high concentration of olefin polymer are functionalized by a very small amount of free radical generator which form transient molecules of functionalized olefin polymer in which the functional groups are unpaired electrons of the so formed polymeric free radical. The polymeric free radical functionalized olefin polymer then attacks the preferably low molecular weight nitrile rubber molecules to form the compatibilizing block copolymer molecules which contain molecular segments of both nitrile rubber and olefin polymer. A reduction in either the molecular weight or concentration of nitrile rubber suppresses the formation of rubber gel. Also, low molecular weight rubber molecules are mobile and can diffuse rapidly to the olefin polymer free radical sites for block polymer formation the resulting compatibilizing block polymer molecules can also diffuse more rapidly to the olefin polymer nitrile rubber interface to exert their compatibilizing effect. Any essentially uncross linked block copolymer of olefin polymer and nitrile rubber is suitable for preparing compatibilized blends of the invention. Examples of suitable block copolymers, methods for preparing them, and the types of linkages visualized between, for example, polypropylene PP and nitrile rubber NBR are shown as follows Generally, the amount of graft forming functional group does not exceed 10 weight percent of the olefin polymer or nitrile rubber. It can, however, be considerably lower with amounts in the vicinities of 1 percent or less being enough to cause sufficient block copolymer formation to enhance the compatability of a blend of olefin polymer and nitrile rubber. The compatibilizing block copolymer can be formed from compatibilizing segments as long as they are functionalized to mutually interact to form a link therebetween. A suitable functionalized olefin polymer may be conveniently prepared by masticating olefin polymer, preferably at a temperature above its melting point, for a period of 1 to 20 minutes, and 0.1 to 20 weight percent methylol phenolic material, in the presence of an activator catalyst which promotes reaction between methylol phenolic material and the olefin polymer. An example of a satisfactory activator is a Lewis acid. Another suitably functionalized olefin polymer may be prepared by causing an unsaturated carboxylic acid such as acrylic or methacrylic acid, maleic acid, anhydride, or ester, or N substituted maleamic acid, to react in the presence of a free radical generator with olefin polymer, by known processes. For example, see US A 2,973,344. The resulting functionalized olefin polymer is then caused to react with a functionalized nitrile rubber. Olefin polymers suitable for functionalization to give block polymer percursors comprise amorphous or crystalline essentially saturated homopolymers or copolymers of C₂ C₈ alpha monoolefins. Thermoplastic crystalline olefin polymers are especially preferred. An important subgroup of olefin polymers comprise high molecular weight solid products from the polymerization of one or more monoolefins by either high pressure or low pressure processes. Examples of such polymers are the isotactic or syndiotactic monoolefin polymers, representative members of which are commercially available. Satisfactory olefins include ethylene, propylene, 1 butene, 1 pentene, 1 hexene, 2 methyl 1 propene, 3 methyl 1 pentene, 4 methyl 1 pentene, 5 methyl 1 hexene, and mixtures thereof. Commercially available thermoplastic polyolefin resin, such as polyethylene, polybutene 1, and polypropylene, or mixtures thereof, may be advantageously used in the practice of the invention with polypropylene being preferred. Also suitable for the practice of the invention are copolymers of two or more olefins with copolymers of ethylene and propylene being preferred. Any methylol phenolic material which will form a graft with olefin polymer may be used in the practice of the invention. Suitable methylol phenolic material may be prepared by condensation of unsubstituted phenol, a C₁ C₁₀ alkyl Any activator catalyst which promotes the graft formation between olefin polymer and methylol phenolic material is suitable for the practice of the invention. Preferred activators are Lewis acids which include the acid acting metal halides such as boron trifloride, stannous chloride, zinc chloride, titanium trior tetrachloride, aluminum chloride, ferric chloride, ferric bromide, zinc bromide, aluminum bromide or complexes thereof. Suitable Lewis acids are described in US A 4,121,026, Columns 5 6 . Suitable nitrile rubbers comprise rubbery polymers of 1,3 butadiene or isoprene and acrylonitrile. Preferred nitrile rubbers comprise polymers of 1,3 butadiene and 20 to 50 weight percent acrylonitrile. A functionalized nitrile rubber containing one or more graft forming functional groups is preferred for preparing block copolymer compatibilizers of the invention. The aforesaid graft forming functional groups are different from and are in addition to the olefinic and cyano groups normally present in nitrile rubber. Carboxylic modified nitrile rubbers containing carboxy groups and amine modified nitrile rubbers containing amino groups are especially useful for the preparation of block copolymers comprising segments of nitrile rubber. Any nitrile rubber, regardless of molecular weight, is suitable for the preparation of block copolymer, but, as indicated earlier, liquid nitrile rubbers having a molecular weight of less than 50,000 are preferred for this purpose. This contrasts with the nitrile rubber components of the blend which is a solid rubber having an average molecular weight of at least 50,000, and preferably, between 100,000 and 1,000,000. Commercially available nitrile rubbers suitable for the practice of the invention are described in The improved blends of the invention may be prepared by mixing olefin polymer, high molecular weight nitrile rubber, and block copolymer, preferably above the melting point of the olefin polymer by the use of conventional masticating equipment, for example, a rubber mill, Brabender Mixer, Banbury Mixer, or twin screw continuous mixer. Mixing times should be sufficient to obtain homogeneous blends. Satisfactory mixing times depend upon the types of olefin polymer and nitrile rubber and upon the type and amount of block copolymer. Typically, mixing times of 2 to 30 minutes are satisfactory. The compatibilized blends of the invention are further improved by vulcanizing the nitrile rubber by conventional techniques. Vulcanizing agents are incorporated into the blends and the blends are heated to effect cure. The characteristics of the blends containing cured nitrile rubber depend upon the relative proportions of olefin polymer and nitrile rubber and whether the compositions are statically or dynamically cured. Static curing can give thermoset compositions when the blend contains more than 30 parts by weight of cured nitrile rubber per 100 parts by weight of olefin polymer whereas, dynamic curing can give thermoplastic compositions even when the blend contains 80 or more parts by weight of cured nitrile rubber per 100 parts by weight of olefin polymer. Generally, compositions comprising 50 parts or more of cured nitrile rubber per 100 parts by weight of olefin polymer are elastomeric. The effect of the relative proportions on blend composition characteristics cannot be defined with precision because the limits vary depending upon a number of factors, such as, the kind of olefin polymer and nitrile rubber, the presence of fillers, plasticizers and other ingredients, and the extent the rubber is cured. Of course, it is understood that the properties of the compositions of the invention may be modified by the addition of ingredients which are conventional in the compounding of olefin polymer, nitrile rubber, and blends thereof. For additional information concerning compounding and dynamic vulcanization, refer to US A 4,104,210, issued August 1, 1978. Compositions prepared by dynamic vulcanization comprising a blend of 25 65 parts by weight of olefin polymer, preferably polypropylene, and correspondingly, 75 35 parts by weight of cured nitrile rubber in the form of small particles preferably 50 micrometres or less dispersed throughout the olefin polymer, in which the blend has been compatibilized, prior to vulcanization, with a block copolymer comprising olefin polymer compatibilizing segments and nitrile rubber compatibilizing segments are especially preferred. Elastomer compositions generally contain no more than 55 parts of polypropylene per 100 parts of the composition. Improved blend compositions of the invention can be used to form a variety of molded, extruded, or calendered articles. The properties of the blend depend upon the proportions of the components in the blend with a wide range of properties being available simply by varying the proportions of the blend components. The stress strain properties of the composition are determined in accordance with ASTM test procedures. For the compositions of Table 2, tests are carried out using a Microdumbbell tensile test specimen ASTM D 1708 66 having a test length of 2.23 cm 0.876 inch . An Instron tensile tester is used to pull the specimens apart during the test for tensile strength and ultimate elongation. The tester is designed to measure changes in jaw separation in inches. Though the initial jaw separation was adjusted to the ASTM procedure, to 2.29 cm 0.90 inch and the specimen length and jaw separation are not 2.54 cm. 1.00 inch , the elongation at break was read as the jaw separation increase, in inches. The percent ultimate elongation or elongation at break was calculated by multiplying the change in jaw separation required to break the specimen measured in inches by 100. It is true that the original unstrained sample length was 2.23 cm 0.876 inch not 2.54 cm and one might expect that the change in inches in jaw separation should be divided by 0.876 inch 2.23 cm as well as being multiplied by 100. However, it is also true that some flow of the specimen occurs in the jaws, which flow, in effect, somewhat increases the initial or unstrained length. Since the effective length change due to flow of the specimen in the jaws is difficult to measure in each case, and since the effect of this is in the opposite direction of not dividing by 0.876, it was found expedient to estimate the percent ultimate elongation or elongation at break, merely by multiplying the jaw separation at break measured in inches 1 inch 2,54 cm by 100. The actual value may deviate from this somewhat however, the method presented herewith is incorporated into the definition for percent elongation used herein. Test specimens are pulled to 2.5 cm. per minute up to 30 percent elongation and 25.4 cm. per minute to failure. For the rest of the compositions not in Table 2 ASTM D 638 was used. Polypropylene having methylol phenolic groups grafted thereto is prepared by masticating polypropylene and methylol phenolic material at 80 rpm s with an oil bath temperature of about 180 C in a Brabender Mixer. The ingredients are shown in Table 1. All parts are by weight. After the polypropylene Profax 6723 is melted, dimethylol Compatibilized blends Table 2 are prepared by masticating modified polypropylene and nitrile rubber in a Brabender mixer for 3 minutes after the polypropylene is melted. Stock 1 is a control containing unmodified polypropylene. Stock 2 is an improved composition of the invention where 50 parts by weight of modified polypropylene Stock b of Table 1 are mixed with 50 parts by weight of nitrile rubber Hycar 1092 80 . In Stocks 3 and 4, and nitrile rubber is dynamically cured by melt mixing the blend with dimethylol phenolic curative. Enough residual cure activator is present in the modified polypropylene to activate the phenolic curative. The data show a substantial improvement in tensile strength and ultimate elongation by use of the modified polypropylene. This indicates graft formation between polypropylene and nitrile rubber. By functionalizing the polypropylene, the true stress at break nearly doubles. Stocks 3 and 4 show that curing the nitrile rubber results in further improvement in ultimate elongation and true stress at break. In Table 3, compositions of the invention are illustrated in which the polyolefin nitrile rubber block copolymer is derived from methylol phenolic modified polypropylene and amine terminated nitrile rubber. The methylol phenolic modified polypropylene of Table 1 Stocks a , b and c are mixed with a nitrile rubber masterbatch comprising 90 parts nitrile rubber and 10 parts amine terminated nitrile rubber. The nitrile rubber is purchased as Hycar 1092 80 and the amine terminated rubber is purchased as Hycar ATBN 1300X16. The modified polypropylene and the nitrile rubber masterbatch are mixed in a Brabender mixer at 180 C for a period of about 5 minutes after the modified polypropylene is melted. In Stock 5, the blend is mixed for 30 minutes before adding the curative. During mixing, a block copolymer of amine terminated nitrile rubber and the methylol phenolic modified polypropylene is formed. The blends are then dynamically vulcanized by the addition of phenolic curative in the quantities indicated. Mixing is continued until maximum Brabender consistency is obtained. The compositions are removed from the mixer then returned and mixed for 1 additional minute. The compositions are then cooled in a press and then compression molded at 210 C. Stock 1 is a control containing unmodified polypropylene. Stock 2 illustrates that very little, if any, block copolymer is formed when polypropylene and dimethylol phenolic material are masticated without activator. Stocks 3 through 5 illustrate compositions of the invention wherein block copolymers are prepared by causing amine terminated nitrile rubber to react with polypropylene which had been functionalized with methylol phenolic material in the presence of activator, The enhanced compatibility indicated by property improvements of Stocks 3, 4, and 5, indicates that block copolymer had formed. For example, the properties of the composition of Stock 2 are about the same as control Stock 1 except for a slight increase in elongation whereas, Stocks 3, 4, and 5 show a substantial increase in both tensile strength and elongation. It is noted that the longer mixing time of Stock 5 results in a vulcanized blend with extraordinarily high tensile strength. The extended mixing time probably results in a greater quantity of block copolymer being formed. A study of curative levels is illustrated in Table 4. The compositions are prepared in the same manner as in Table 3, except the mixing time before curative addition was 10 minutes and the modified polypropylene, Stock d of Table 1, is used. Also, antidegradants are added and mixed for 1 minute prior to removing the compositions from the mixer. The nitrile rubber and the amine terminated nitrile rubber are the same as used in Table 3. Antidegradant 1 is polymerized 1,2 dihydro 2,2,4 trimethylquinoline, commercially available as Flectol H antioxidant. Antidegradant 2 is the zinc salt of 2 mercaptotolylimidazole, commercially available as Vanox ZMTI. Each of the compositions exhibit an excellent combination of properties including high tensile strength and a high ultimate elongation resulting in an excellent true stress at break. Higher curative levels give better tension set values lower but it causes a reduction in both tensile strength and elongation. The effect of the relative proportions of polypropylene and nitrile rubber are illustrated in Table 5. The ingredients and the preparation procedures are the same as for the compositions of Table 4. The curative level is kept constant at 12.5 parts phenolic curative per 100 parts of nitrile rubber and the antidegradant levels are kept constant at 1.5 parts each by weight per 100 parts by weight of nitrile rubber. The data show that increasing the amount of modified polypropylene results in improved tensile strength and higher elongations. Increasing the amount of rubber results in improved tension set. A study of the effect of the concentration of amine terminated nitrile rubber in the The data show that improved compositions are obtained by the presence of block copolymer. The data show that the amount of amine terminated liquid nitrile rubber can be reduced from 10 of the nitrile rubber to 2.5 thereof with the continued maintenance of the properties of the composition. The amount of amine terminated nitrile rubber can be further reduced to as little as 0.16 of the nitrile rubber and still a significant improvement due to its presence is observed. A plot, on a log scale, of amine terminated rubber concentration versus the improvement in tensile product, ultimate tensile strength times ultimate elongation, indicates that as little as 0.1 of the nitrile rubber needed be grafted to a portion of the polypropylene to give a noticeable improvement in mechanical properties. Polypropylene 100 parts by weight is modified by 4 parts by weight of a substituted maleic acid, namely, N carboxymethyl maleamic acid CMMA or N carbamoyl maleamic acid CMA . Lupersol 101 peroxide was used to promote modification, 0.087 parts by weight for CMMA and 0.174 parts by weight for CMA. Thermoplastic elastomeric compositions are prepared by dynamic vulcanization following the procedure and using the nitrile rubber masterbatch of Table 6. The data are shown in Table 7. The data show that blends containing block copolymer derived from amine terminated nitrile rubber and polypropylene modified with substituted maleamic acid exhibit improved properties. The data also indicate that block copolymer from N carboxymethyl maleamic acid modified polypropylene gives superior blends. The importance of first functionalizing the polyolefin before causing it to react with the nitrile rubber to form a block copolymer is illustrated in Table 8. Improved compositions obtained from a block copolymer derived from a functionalized liquid nitrile rubber are also illustrated. Stocks 1 4 contain high molecular weight nitrile rubber and in Stocks 5 8 the nitrile rubber contains ten weight percent of liquid nitrile rubber, i.e., 45 parts of high m.w. nitrile rubber and 5 parts of liquid nitrile rubber containing amino groups. Stocks 1 and 5 are control blends prepared by melt mixing polypropylene and rubber. Stocks 2 and 6 are also control blends prepared by treating the blends of Stocks 1 and 4 with the indicated quantities of dimethylolphenolic material and activator. Stocks 3 and 7 illustrate improved blends are obtained by first introducing dimethylolphenolic groups in the polypropylene which subsequently forms a block copolymer with the nitrile rubber. Stocks 4 and 8 illustrate the additional improvement obtained by dynamic vulcanization of Stocks 3 and 7. The data show that superior blends result from the presence of a compatibilizing amount of block copolymer. Compatibilized blends containing block copolymer prepared from amorphous polypropylene are shown in Table 9. A block copolymer is prepared by mixing at 190 C, 100 parts by weight of amorphous polypropylene Afax 900D , 2 parts by weight of maleic acid and 0.2 parts by weight of an organic peroxide L 101 . After 5 minutes, 25 parts by weight of an amine terminated nitrile rubber Hycar 1300X16 are added and mixing is continued for 3 additional minutes. Compatibilized blends of polypropylene, nitrile rubber, and block copolymer are prepared and subsequently cured by dynamic vulcanization. Stocks 1 and 3 are controls with the same quantities of amorphous polypropylene and amine terminated nitrile rubber as in the block copolymer. The data show a substantial improvement in properties for stocks 2 and 4 which contain the block copolymer. Block copolymers prepared from chlorinated polypropylene and nitrile rubber, and maleic acid modified polypropylene and nitrile rubber containing carboxy groups are illustrated in Table 10. Polypropylene powder Profax 6523 is chlorinated by passing chlorine through it at room temperature. It is then devolatilized to constant weight in an oven at 100 C. The treated polypropylene contains about 1 2 weight percent chlorine. A 50 50 blend of chlorinated polypropylene and the nitrile rubber masterbatch containing 10 amine terminated liquid nitrile rubber is prepared by melt mixing. During melt mixing, block copolymer is formed. A thermoplastic elastomeric composition is prepared by dynamic vulcanization with phenolic curative Stock 2. A similar blend is prepared with untreated polypropylene, Stock 1. The data show the blend containing block copolymer exhibits superior properties. Polypropylene is functionalized with maleic acid by melt mixing 100 parts by weight polypropylene Profax 6723 and 5 parts by weight of maleic acid. After a homogeneous mixture is obtained, one part by weight of organic peroxide Lupersol 101 is added and mixing is continued until a constant consistency is obtained. A masterbatch is prepared by melt mixing 90 parts by weight of virgin polypropylene, 10 parts by weight of the above maleic acid modified polypropylene, and 0.15 parts by weight of triethylenetetramine. A blend of 50 parts by weight of triethylenetetramine treated, maleic acid modified polypropylene masterbatch and 50 parts by weighs of carboxynitrile rubber Hycar 1072 CG were melt mixed during which time the triethylenetetramine derived moiety forms a bridge between carboxy groups of the nitrile rubber. The compatibilized mixture is then dynamically vulcanized with phenolic curative. Stock 3 is a control with unmodified polypropylene. The data shows that the compatibilized composition exhibits substantially improved properties. A block copolymer is prepared by boiling for 15 minutes, one part by weight of maleic acid modified polypropylene same as in Table 6 , and one part by weight of amine terminated nitrile rubber Hycar 1300X16 in 86 parts by weight of xylene. After cooling, and by the addition of an equal volume of acetone, the block copolymer is precipitated. A compatibilized blend is prepared by melt mixing and dynamic vulcanization of 49 parts by weight of polypropylene, one part by weight of the block copolymer prepared above , 50 parts by weight of nitrile rubber, and the indicated amount of phenolic curative. The properties are shown in Table 10, Stock 6. Stock 5 is a control without block copolymer. The data show a substantial improvement in properties as the result of the addition of a small quantity of block copolymer. An improved compatibilized blend can contain a block copolymer having a nitrile rubber compatibilizing segment derived from low molecular weight polyamide. A composition of the invention is prepared by melt mixing at 190 C, 50 parts by weight of phenolic modified polypropylene Stock d of Table 1 , 50 parts by weight of nitrile rubber Hycar 1092 80 and one part by weight of low molecular weight polyamide Versamid PA 140, amine number 370 400 . The mixture is masticated for ten minutes. Phenolic curative is then added and the mixture is dynamically vulcanized. Another composition is prepared in a similar manner except without any polyamide. The properties are shown in Table 11. The data show a substantial improvement in tensile strength and elongation indicating enhanced compatibilization for the composition containing a block copolymer derived from polyamide. Compatibilized blends containing block copolymers containing various compatibilizing segments are illustrated in Table 12. A modified nylon block copolymer is prepared by melt mixing in a Brabender mixer at 230 C under nitrogen, 100 parts by weight of nylon 6,6 6, 6 10 copolymer Zytel 63 and 100 parts by weight of a liquid carboxylated butadiene rubber Hycar 2000X162 . After mixing 3 minutes, ten parts by weight of an epoxy resin Epon 1007, epoxide equivalent 2000 to 2500 are added and mixing is continued for 5 additional minutes. The nylon block copolymer is removed, cooled, and used as an additive in Stock 2. Other block copolymers are prepared Although the invention has been illustrated by typical examples, it is not limited thereto.
