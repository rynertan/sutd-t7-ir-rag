# Process for the production of polyester copolymers.

## Abstract
The invention is a process for esterifying organic dicar boxylic acid and diol at elevated temperatures and thereafter transesterifying the esterification product in the presence of a diol and a diester at elevated temperatures thereafter poly merizing the transesterification product in a condensation stage to form a polycondensed copolyester having an intrin sic viscosity from .2 to .9.
