# Method for preparing hydrocarbon catalytic cracking catalyst compositions.

## Abstract
A catalyst composition suitable for catalytic cracking of a heavy hydrocarbon oil containing large amounts of metal contaminants is prepared by the steps of spray drying an aqueous slurry containing a flash calcined alumina obtained by contacting an aluminum hydroxide prepared Bayer s process with a hot air of 350 700 C for 5 seconds or less, clay being predominantly composed of silica and alumna, a precursor of a siliceous inorganic oxide and a crystalline aluminosilicate washing this particle until the alkali metal content therein is reduced to 1.0wt or less as oxide and thereafter incorporating a rare earth component in the particle.
