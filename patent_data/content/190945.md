# Herbicidal propylene oxide derivatives.

## Abstract
Compounds of the formula CHEM wherein R 1 is optionally substituted phenyl or thienyl R 2 , R 3 , R 4 , R 3 , and R 4 , are organic groups, or other than R 2 may be halogen, CN or NO2. X is F, CH3 or OR 6 , where R 6 is H or an organic group X 1 is H, F, CH3 or OR 6 L is keto or alkylene exhibit herbicidal activity, especially selective activity on weeds in rice. Some also show a plant growth regulant effect. The novel compounds may be made e.g. be peroxidising an appropriate olefinic starting material.
