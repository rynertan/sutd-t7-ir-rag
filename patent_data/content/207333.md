# Electrodeless high pressure sodium iodide arc lamp.

## Abstract
High pressure xenon is used as a buffer gas in an elec rodeless sodium iodide arc lamp. Very high efficacies are achieved by using an arc tube with rounded edges and by surrounding a portion of the arc tube with quartz wool. The arc tube may also contain small amounts of mercury iodide.
