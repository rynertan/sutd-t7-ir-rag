# An hydraulic actuator for a vehicle internal shoe drum brake.

## Abstract
An hydraulic actuator comprises a first piston 3 and a second piston 4 both working in a bore 2 in a housing 1 and the actuator incorporates a pressure proportioning valve 5 . The valve 5 comprises a valve head 13 for engage ment with a seating 21 , first and second stems 14, 28 projecting from the head 13 and through the first piston 3 in each of two opposite directions, each stem 14, 28 being of an area smaller than that of the head 13 , a seal 16 between the first stem 14 and the first piston 3 , a first spring 23 acting between an abutment adjacent to the seal 16 and a shoulder 27 on the first stem 14 to urge the head 13 in a first direction away from the seating 21 and into engagement with a stop 18 , and a second spring 24 acting on an enlargement 29 on the second stem 28 also to urge the head 13 in the first direction and to augment the force in the first spring 23 . The second piston 4 is provided with a longitudinally extending recess 12 into which the second stem 28 and the second spring 24 both project.
