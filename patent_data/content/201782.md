# Device for supporting cops in circular knitting machines, particularly in fixed needle cylinder knitting machines.

## Abstract
This device for supporting cops in circular knitting machines, particularly in fixed needle cylinder knitting machines, comprises a plurality of frames 2 which are arranged close together around the machine axis 16 and carry the machine feed cops 10 . Each frame 2 is translat able parallel to itself along a direction having a substantially parallel component to the machine axis 16 from a first raised working position to a second depressed position away from the machine axis to enable a floor based operator to get at the cops of one frame when the latter occupies the second position the device also comprises hooks for locking the frames in the first position.
