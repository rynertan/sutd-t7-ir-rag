## Description
HIGH IMPACT FIRE RETARDANT MONOVINYL AROMATIC RESIN COMPOSITION The present invention relates to styrene resin compositions which have a reduced flammability and, more specifically, to such resin compositions having a high impact resistance, improved release property and a reduced tendency to burn in the absence of an external heat source.Recently, in the fields of application of styrene resins, especially in those fields associated with low current electricity, there has been an increasingly higher demand for styrene resins having a reduced flammability and various methods have been proposed to make such styrene resins which are of reduced flammability, including high impact polystyrene, styrene acrylonitrile butadiene copolymers, styrene methylmethacrylatebutadiene copolymers and so forth.As one example of such methods, it is well known that styrene resins can be prepared that have a reduced tendency to ignite and propagate flame in the absence of an external heat source, by adding thereto an organic halide together with an inorganic flame retardant such as antimony trioxide.However, the use of these flame retardants, especially of those particulate or crystalline flame retardants such as antimony trioxide which do not melt and diffuse at temperatures at which styrene resins are usually worked, are likely to remarkably lower the toughness of the polymers and to aggravate desirable properties peculiar to the resins. For this reason, machines having a high mixing efficiency have been used to work such styrene resins, but no appreciable improvement has been achieved. Also, during their molding those styrene resins to which a flame retardant is added exhibit a much aggrevated release property. This constitutes a great limitation on the improvement in the degree of freedom in designing moldings and the productivity which are advantageous features of the styrene resins. Therefore, an improvement in the release property thereof from molds has been strongly desired in the industry.Organic halides are very effective in providing the polymers with a reduced tendency to ignite and burn in the absence of an external heat source, but have a tendency to make the polymers drip while they are burning and, in order to bring the polymers to fall in the range of V l to V O provided under Subject 94 by Underwriters Laboratories Inc. hereinafter referred to as UL , a large amount of halides must be added. It is well known that the use of antimony compounds in combination with the halides is effective in obviating such a defect. However, even with the addition of the antimony compounds, the polymers tend to drip as the thickness of the polymer moldings becomes smaller, and it is very difficult to bring the polymers to conform to the range of V l to V O under UL 94. Thus, the solution to this problem has also long been desired. The tests employed herein to demonstrate supressed ignition properties and burning accurately demonstrate the ignition or burning characteristics of the polymers when exposed to small scale ignition sources according to the tests employed. It is well recognized by those skilled in this art and should be clearly understood by others, that all known organic polymers will burn when subjected to a sufficiently intense heat source whether or not they contain a fire retardant additive. As a means of obtaining an improved release property of styrene resins, it is conventionally known to add higher fatty acids, their metal salts, waxes, etc. to the resins.However, the addition of such materials does not remarkably improve the release property of the styrene resins to which a halide flame retardant is added and, in addition, makes such resins more combustible and more ready to drip and, as a result, degrades the reduced flammability property thereof. To drip or dripping referred to herein, according the vertical burning test under UL 94, means for flaming particles to drip from a specimen during the application of a test flame, after the removal of the flame.The objects which drip from the specimen are called flaming particles. We have now conducted a series of intensive studies to overcome the aforementioned shortcomings and succeeded in obtaining a resin composition having a remarkably improved impact resistance and release property, as well as a significantly reduced tendency to ignite or propagate flame in the absence of an external heat source. Accordingly, the present invention provides a resin composition having a high impact resistance, improved release property and a reduced tendency to ignite and to propagate flame in the absence of an external heat source which resin composition is obtained by mixing a polymer obtained from a major amount of a monovinyl aromatic monomer, a block copolymer consisting essentially of styrene and butadiene, an amorphous alpha olefin polymer or copolymer, a halide flame retardant and an antimony compound. Further advantageously, in has been found that the resin composition according to the present invention can be processed into very thin moldings with a reduced tendency to ignite and propagate flame in the absence of an external heat source well satisfying the UL 94 and without causing dripping. According to the present invention, a simple polymer of an aromatic monovinyl compound, or a graft copolymer obtained by copolymerizing an aromatic monovinyl compound with a rubber polymer, may be used as the base resin. The aromatic monovinyl compounds herein referred to include styrene, alpha methylstyrene, nuclear substituted methylstyrene, nuclear substituted ethylstyrene, nuclearsubstituted butylstyrene, bromostyrene, and derivatives thereof. The rubber polymer herein referred to may be any polymers generally exhibiting rubber like properties, including conjugated diolef in polymers or copolymers such as polybutadiene and styrene butadiene copolymer, rubberlike olefin copolymers such as ethylene propylene copolymer, and rubber like alkyl acrylate polymer or copolymer, etc. Typical examples of base resins comprising the aforementioned compositions are polystyrene and high impact polystyrene. According to the present invention, it is essential to add to the base resin a SB block copolymer together with an amorphous alpha olefin polymer. Although it is wellknown that the impact resistance of polystyrene and highimpact polystyrene can be improved by adding thereto a SB block copolymer1 the inventors have obtained an unexpected finding that adding a SB block copolymer to polystyrene of reduced flammability or high impact polystyrene obtained by addition thereto of a halide flame retardant or antimony compound simulataneously with the addition of said flameretardant or succeeding thereto not only improves the impact resistance considerably as compared with the case in which the SB block copolymer is added to polystyrene or highimpact polystyrene without addition of the flameretardant compound, but also results in the prevention of the aforesaid dripping and improvement in the flame retardance, as far as the added quantity thereof is proper. However, if the SB block copolymer is added alone, the release property of the resin from the mold used in the molding process remains at a lower level and the resin composition cannot be used satisfactorily as far as its practical application is concerned. If fatty acids, their metal salts or waxes are added thereto to improve the release property, not only is the desired improvement not achieved, but also the effect of preventing the dripping achieved by the addition of the SB block copolymer will be aggrevated. The inventors have found that the addition of an amorphous alpha olefin polymer to the resin instead of those releasing agents as mentioned above can result in a desired release property without adversely affecting the dripping prevention effect, and, more advantageously, improve the impact resistance of the resin.Thus, the present invention based on the forementioned finding can provide an excellent resin composition. The SB block copolymers used in the resin composition of the present invention may include those copolymers which are obtained by copolymerizing other olefines and or diolefins with the styrene butadiene block copolymers in addition to the latter copolymers. Most preferably, the ratio of styrene to butadiene of the styrene butadiene block copolymer should be 10 to 70 percent by weight to 90 to 30 percent by weight with the average molecular weight thereof ranging from 10,000 to 500,000. The amorphous alpha olefin polymer used in the resin composition according to the present invention may be any of those alpha olefin polymers which have almost no crystallinity such as atactic polypropylene, atactic polyethylene, ethylene propylene copolymer, ethylene propyleneconjugated diolef in copolymer, propylene butadiene copolymer, and so forth. Among these, particularly preferred is an amorphous alpha olefin polymer with the molecular weight of the ethylene propylene copolymer thereof ranging from 10,000 to 500,000. The halide flame retardants used according to the present invention may be any well known agents, including decabromodiphenyl ether, tetrabromobisphenol A, hexabromobenzene, hexabromocyclododecane and tris 2,3 dibromopropyl phosphate. The antimony compounds used according to the present invention include antimony trioxide, antimony pentoxide, antimony trichloride and antimony trisulfide. As to the ratio of the components of the resin composition of the present invention, it is preferable to mix 1 10 parts by weight of SB block copolymer, 0.2 10 parts by weight of amorphous alpha olefin polymer, 1 40 parts by weight of halide flame retardant and 0.5 15 parts by wight of antimony compound per 100 parts byweight of styrene resin. According to the present invention, the content of SB block polymer is limited to the range of 1 10 parts by weight, because the addition thereof below 1 part by weight hardly improves the impact resistance and reduced flammability while the addition thereof above 10 parts by weight deteriorates the reduced flammability of the resin.That is to say, the SB block copolymer as added in the aforementioned range best contributes to the improvement in the reduced flammability as well as the impact resistance. Also, the content of the amorphous alpha olefin polymer is limited to the range of 0.2 10 parts by weight according to the present invention, because the content thereof below 0.2 parts by weight hardly improves the release property of the resin, while the content thereof above 10 parts by weight deteriorates the flammability characteristics of the resultant resin composition. The contents of the halide flame retardant and antimony compound as well as the ratio of halogen and antimony according to the present invention may fall in any of well known ranges.However, the contents thereof below a certain lower limit level cannot bring forth an adequate reduction in flammability while the resin properties will be remarkably degraded with contents thereof exceeding a certain higher limit. In mixing the aforementioned components, an intended kneaded mixture may be obtained by first mixing the component materials by an ordinary mixing machine such as a mixer, drum blender or kneader and, then, kneading the mixture through an extruder or meltkneading the same through a heating roll, Banbury mixer or other suitable means. In this case, a coloring agent, plasticizer, stabilizer, ultraviolet absorber, foaming agent, inorganic reinforcing agent and or other additives which do not adversely affect the resin composition according to the present invention may be added in a suitable amount, respectively, as required. Hereinafter,the present invention will be described further in detail by way of the preferred embodiments thereof and comparative examples.

As clearly seen from the comparative examples shown in Table 2, the addition of a flame retardant to high impact polystyrene comparative example No. 3 remarkably lowered the impact resistance of the resin comparative example No. 5 . However, a further addition thereto of a suitable amount of a block SBR resulted in an improvement in impact resistance and reduced ignition and flammability property comparative example No.6 . In this case, the improvement in the impact resistance was more remarkable in the resin which was rendered less ignitable and less flammable than the resin that was not made less ignitable and less flammable comparative example No. 4 . Since singly adding the blockSBR did not improve the release property, stearic acid or calcium stearate that had been used as a release agent from the past was further added. However, not only the reduced tendency to burn was deteriorated, but also an adequate release property could not be achieved comparative examples Nos. 2, 7 and 8 . Further, even with the combination of the block SBR according to the present invention with an amorphous alpha olefin polymer, the addition thereof by a quantity exceeding a proper level is not desirable in that such an excessive addition increased the tendency of the polymer to burn comparative examplesNo. 9 and 10 . Thus, it is obvious that the resin compositions according to the present invention as shown in Table I are much superior to the comparative examples representative of the prior art resin compositions in all respects including the impact resistance, reduced tendency of the polymer to ignite and propagate flame in the absence of an external heat source.
