# A LIGHTING FITTING

## Abstract
A lighting fitting for hazardous areas comprises a central hub 18 . Each lateral face of the hub incorporates a connector 11, 13 into which a module 20 containing control equipment for the fitting may be housed. A further connector 15 is disposed in the underside of the hub to receive the lamp 1 . The hub 18 houses a microswitch 30 , which may be flameproof, through which the power supply to the connector 11, 13, 15 is controlled. Springs 33 in the connectors, a locking plate 32 and an actuator shaft 31 combine to prevent operation of the microswitch 30 unless and until a lamp and all modules are connected to their respective connectors. This construction aids manufacturing flexibility and economy and enhances safety.
