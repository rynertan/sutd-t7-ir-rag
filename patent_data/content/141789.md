# A DISPENSING ARRANGEMENT

## Abstract
A dispensing arrangement for dispensing planar lottery tickets and like articles comprises a chute which in cross section corresponds to the surface configuration of a lottery ticket, and at one end of which there is arranged a dispensing mechanism intended for separating a lottery ticket lying nearest the mechanism through a slot like opening. Accord ing to the invention, the dispensing mechanism includes a friction member 12 which can move in the dispensing direc tion and which in a first position is located beneath or in the plane in which a lottery ticket located nearest the mechanism 12 is intended to lie, and which in a second position is lo cated above this plane. In the second position of the friction member, the friction member 12 lifts the end of a lottery ticket opposite the slot like opening, wherewith the lottery ticket is supported at three locations, namely against the friction member 12 and against two mutually spaced and mutually parallel support bars 9 or like members. The sup port bars 9, 10 and a stop bar 21 located at right angles to each of the support bars define therebetween slot like open ings 18 . A lottery ticket is fed out through the slot like open ings 18 by movement of the friction members 12 in the dispensing direction, while supporting the lottery ticket at the aforementioned three abutment locations, at least during the first stage of a dispensing operation.
