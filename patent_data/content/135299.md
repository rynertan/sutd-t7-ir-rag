# Improved weatherproof positive lock connector.

## Abstract
The device is used to connector electrical conduits together and comprises a male plug and a female receptacle, each of which has a housing with a central tubular compo nent and a cavity extending through and adapted to receive an electrical conduit. When the plug and receptacle are joined together an electrical conduit ends disposed in the plug and receptacle are electrically interconnected. Both the plug and receptacle also include means for securing the conduits in place and sealing means for thermally sealing the conduits therein against atmospheric conditions. The central tubular components are electrically insulative. The male plug has a plurality of flexible fingers extending from the front end thereof while the receptacle has its tubular member dimensioned such that it splits the fingers as the plug and receptacle are joined together. The receptacle tubular mem ber has a plurality of recesses into which the finger ends snap to hold the plug and receptacle together. Locking tabs slide over these recesses to lock the fingers in the recesses. The fingers are retractable from the recesses, thus permitting uncoupling of the plug and receptacle, by sliding the outer sleeve of the receptacle rearwardly against an internal spring and carrying with it the locking tabs to a rear unlocked position. The device is simple, durable and highly effective. It is utilized in interconnecting nuclear reactor cable compo nents and in other high temperature corrosive environments which require positive locking thermal and corrosion resist ant connectors. The device is also useful in high frequency electrical conductor applications.
