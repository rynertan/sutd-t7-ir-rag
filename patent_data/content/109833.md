# Winding apparatus.

## Abstract
Winding apparatus for manufacturing transformer cores includes a ribbon dispensing assembly 12 which travels in a predetermined path about a stationary mandrel 14 to deposit successive layers of ribbon upon the mandrel under controlled tension while applying transverse pressure to the peripheral surface of the winding to press air from between the layers. In the preferred embodiment, a counterbalanced rotating track 28 engages the ribbon dispensing assembly as it travels around the mandrel.
