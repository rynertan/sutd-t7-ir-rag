# An assembly including an airfoil extending between shroud sections and method of making the same.

## Abstract
A turbine engine component 10 having an annular array 17 of airfoils 16 connected with inner 12 and outer 14 shrouds. The airfoils 16 are cast separately from the shrouds 12,14 to enable the airfoils 16 and shrouds 12,14 to be made from either the same or different materials. The airfoils 16 advantageously have an elongated columnar grain structure with grain boundaries extending parallel to the leading 36 and trailing 38 edges of the airfoils 16 . The inner 12 and outer 14 shrouds are each formed of a plurality of arcuate sections 18 and 19 respectively which also may have an elongated columnar grain structure. The ends of the arcuate shroud sections 18,19 are interconnected in such an orientation that the grain boundaries extend circumferentially around the circular shrouds 12,14 to minimize the extent to which ends of the grains are exposed. In another embodiment of the invention, each of the arcuate shroud sections 18,19 is formed of a single crystal. In accordance with a feature of the invention, the forming of a turbine segment 26 which includes a pair of arcuate shroud sections 18,19 and one or more airfoils 16 is facilitated by using a spacer bar 70,72 . The spacer bar 70,72 holds the shroud sections 18,19 in a fixed spatial relationship relative to each other while airfoils 16 are connected with the shroud sections 18,19 . Once the airfoils 16 have been connected with the shroud sections 18, 19 , the spacer bar 70,72 is removed.
