# Hot sprue valve assembly for an injection molding machine.

## Abstract
A hot sprue valve assembly is provided for controlling flow of molten material through a hot sprue bushing of an injection molding machine. The valve assembly is particularly designed for use with an injection molding machine for molding centrally apertured record discs, such as video information discs, and the valve assembly includes means for forming the central aperture in the disc. In one embodiment, the aperture forming means comprises a sleeve valve for molding the aperture in the disc prior to solidification of the disc forming melt, whereas in another embodiment the aperture forming means comprises a punch for punching the aperture subsequent to solidification of the disc forming melt.
