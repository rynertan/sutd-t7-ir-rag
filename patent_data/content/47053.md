# Tilt cab vehicle with cab support stay, and stay suitable for use with such vehicle.

## Abstract
A stay can be used to support a cab of a tilt cab vehicle selectively in a first raised position in which the cab has been pivoted through an angle of, for example, 40 and the stay is in compression, and in a second raised position in which the cab has been pivoted through a larger angle of, for example, 50 and the stay is in tension. The stay comprises an arm pivoted at 3 to the cab, and an arm 4 pivoted to the vehicle frame. The ends of the arms overlap and are connected by means of a pin 5 which passes through specially shaped slots 6 7 extending in each arm. The pin 5 is formed with offset pairs of flats which cooperate with the slots 6 7 in the arms, and the pin can be rotated by a lever 14 which controls operation of the stay.
