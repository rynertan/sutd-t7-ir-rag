DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention relates to anti viral compounds and. more particularly, to 9 2.3 dihydroxy l propoxymethyl guanine of formula I and 9 1,3dihydroxy 2 propoxymethyl guanine of formula II and to acyl or phosphate derivatives thereof.EMI4.1 In the compounds of formulas I and II, the hydrogen atom of either hydroxyl group may be replaced by an acyl group. For example, a group of the formulaEMI4.2 wherein R3 is a straight or branched chain alkyl group of 1 to 20 carbon atoms which may be saturated or mono or polyunsaturated, aryl, substituted aryl, heterocyclyl, aralkyl, alkoxyalkyl, or aryloxyalkyl. Also, the hydrogen atom of either hydroxyl group may be substituted by a phosphate group of the formulaEMI5.1 or both hydrogens may be replaced byEMI5.2 wherein R4 and R5 are independently H. a pharmaceutically acceptable cation, straight or branched chain alkyl of 1 to 8 carbon atoms, aryl, aralkyl, phosphate or pyrophosphate. In the compound of formula I, whenR3 is alkyl, the R3 group may contain one or more hydroxy. amino. or carboxyl groups.Examples of suitable R3 group are CH CH3 NH2, CH2NH2, CH CH2OH NH2, CH2 2COOH, CH2OH, CH NH2 CH2COOH. Preferably the alkyl group is from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, the aryl group is phenyl, optionally substituted by halogen or alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, the heterocyclyl group is pyridyl, piperidyl, furyl, imidazolyl. tetrahydrofuryl or thienyl, the aralkyl group is phenylalkyl wherein the alkyl moiety has 1 to 4 carbon atoms, in the alkoxyalkyl group both the alkoxy and alkyl groups contain 1 to 4 carbon atoms, the aryloxyalkyl group is phenoxyalkyl wherein the alkyl moiety has 1 to 4 carbon atoms, the pharmaceutically acceptable cation is sodium, potassium, ammonium, alkyl substituted ammonium wherein the alkyl moiety has 1 to 4 carbon atoms, magnesium 2, calcium 2, or aluminum 3. The compounds disclosed herein have biological or chemical properties which give them advantages in the treatment of the various diseases and ailments associated with members of the herpes group of viruses. Specifically, the compound of Formula II and the corresponding cyclic phosphate thereof hydroxyl hydrogens are replaced byEMI6.1 each have major advantages in efficacy and have been shown to operate by independent biological mechanisms. Also, the compound of Formula I is preferred because of its superior safety in use, that is, its lack of genotoxicity which allows it to be used in the treatment of herpes infections of young adults. Furthermore, the corresponding acyl derivatives of the compounds of Formulas I and II are preferred because they have formulation and pharmacodynamic advantages. that is, the acyl group can impart aqueous or oil solubility which is an asset in oral or topical formulation and can facilitate intestinal uptake or passage through the stratum corneum and can also act to extend plasma half life. The compounds of formulas I and II may be prepared starting from glycerol formal, a mixture of 1,3 dioxan 5 ol of the formulaEMI6.2 wherein R is H and 1.3 dioxolane 4 methanol of the formulaEMI6.3 wherein R is H, of which the compound of formula III is normally the predominant species. The ratio of compounds of formulas III and IV in glycerol formal has been determined to be 57 43 by H. Tibert,Fresenius Z. Anal. Chem., 265, 328 1973 . This ratio may vary, however, for different preparations of glycerol formal. It is to be understood that mixtures containing various ratios of the compounds of formulas III and IV may be employed according to the present invention. The glycerol formal mixture of compounds of formulas III and IV is preferably acylated, e.g. by reaction with an acylating agent such as acetic anhydride in the presence of pyridine, without separation of the individual compounds of formulas III and IV, to give the corresponding acyloxy derivatives wherein R is acyl. This mixture is separated, e.g.by high performance liquid chromatography HPLC . Treatment of the compound of formula III wherein R is Ac acetyl with acetic anhydride in the presence of a catalyst. e.g. Zinc12, gives acetoxymethyl 2,3 diacetoxy 1 propyl ether of formulaEMI7.1 This r eaction is exothermic and takes place at about ambient temperature preferably in an inert atmosphere, e.g. N2. The compound of formula V is then purified and reacted neat or in an inert solvent such as triglyme with diacetylguanine, prepared as described by Ishido et al., Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan, 37, 1389 1964 . of the formula EMI8.1 at elevated temperature under vacuum in the presence of an acidic catalyst, e.g. ethanesulfonic acid, to form 2 acetamido 9 2, 3 diacetoxy l propoxy methyl hypoxanthine VIII of the formulaEMI8.2 as a viscous oil. The oil is taken up in a suitable solvent, e.g. ethyl acetate, and allowed to crystallize. The compound of formula VIII is then deacetylated, e.g. by heating with aqueous methylamine under reflux preferably in an inert atmosphere, e.g. N2, and thn cooled to yield a solution containing the compound of formula I which is optionally treated with charcoal and filtered.Concentration of the filtrate gives a solid which is recrystallized from H20 to give a crystalline product. The compound of formula II may be obtained in similar fashion by reacting the compound of formula IV wherein R is Ac with acetic anhydride in the presence of a catalyst, e.g. ZnC12. to give acetoxymethyl l,3 diacetoxy 2 propyl ether of the formulaEMI9.1 This reaction takes place under similar conditions as used to form compound V from compound III wherein R is Ac. The compound of formula VI is then purified and reacted with diacetylguanine of formula VII, under conditions similar to those used to react the compound of formula V with diacetylguanine, to form 2 acetamido 9 1,3 diacetoxy 2 propoxymethyl hypoxanthine of formula IX as a viscous oil which is crystallized by a procedure similar to that employed for the compound of formula VIII.EMI9.2 The compound of formula IX is then converted to the crystalline product of formula II by treatment similar to that employed to convert the compound of formula VIII to formula I. It is also possible if desired, to separate glycerol formal into its constituent compounds of formulas III and IV wherein R in each case is H and then to treat each separated compound as described above. It is equally possible to form a mixture of compounds of formulas V and VI from glycerol formal by treating the latter directly with acetic anhydride in the presence of a catalyst, e.g., Zinc12. The resulting mixture may be chromatographed by HPLC.Fractions showing only the compound of formula V by analytical HPLC are concentrated under high vacuum and then reacted with diacetylguanine of formula VII as described above to give the compound of formulaVIII which in turn is converted e the compound of formula I as described above. Alternatively, the acetyl intermediates of formulas V and VI, each separately or as a mixture, can be converted to the more reactive halogen derivatives by treatment with hydrogen halide in a nonpolar solvent hydrogen chloride in dichloromethane is preferred wherein the terminal AcOCH2O functionality is transformed to XCH2 0 where X is a halogen chlorine, bromine, or iodine .These halogen compounds can be used in alkylation reactions with protected guanines per trimethylsilyl guanine or diacetylguanine aretwo preferred derivatives in nonpolar or dipolar solvents such as benzene, toluene, acetonitrile or dimethylformamide with or without an acid acceptor substance such as triethylamine or powdered calcium carbonate as has been described in the literature, for example, inU.S. Patent 4.199,574, Chromatographic fractions containing primarily the compound of formula VI are rechromato graphed by HPLC and those fractions of satisfactory purity are combined, concentrated under high vacuum and then reacted with diacetylguanine of formula VII as described above to give the compound of formula IX which in turn is converted to the compound of formula II as described above. While the foregoing process description has referred specifically to compounds wherein the acyl group is acetyl, it is to be understood that the acyl group may equally be a straight or branched chain alkanoyl group of up to about 20 carbon atoms, which may be saturated or mono or polyunsaturated and optionally substituted by aryl, substituted aryl, heterocyclyl, aralkyl, alkoxyalkyl or aryloxyalkyl group. The acyl derivatives are preferably prepared by reacting the compounds of formulas I or II with the appropriate acyl halide, acid anhydride, or other activated acyl species in the presence of an appropriate cosolvent such as, for example, pyridine dimethylformamide. In reactions with acyl halide or acid anhydrides the reaction rate and yield can be increased by addition of a tertiary amine such as triethylamine. 4 Dimethylaminopyridine is an effective catalyst. Other activated acyl species may be prepared by reaction of the acid with a suitable activating agent such as, for example, l,l carbonyl diimidazole, N.N dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or by acylation of N hydroxysuccinimide or l hydroxy benzotriazole by known methods. If the acyl group contains an amir , a hydroxyl, or a carboxyl group, this group must be protected during the acylation reaction. The preferred protection for the amino group is benzyloxycarbonyl and for the hydroxyl or carboxyl group is benzyl. Protecting groups are conveniently removed after the acylation by hydrogenolysis. Compared to acycloguanosine. 9 2 hydroxyethoxymethyl guanine, the compounds of the present invention are more soluble and are more readily phosphorylated by viral enzymes, and have substantially greater activity in vivo than acycloguanosine. The compounds of the present invention may be employed as anti viral compounds in mammalian or avian species either individually or in combination in dosage levels effective to impart an anti herpes virus activity. Typically such levels are from about 0.01 to about 200 mg kg day. The compounds of the present invention may be formulated according to accepted pharmaceutical practice for administration orally. topically or by injection. Suitable oral dosage forms are tablets. capsules, elixirs or powders, while solutions or suspensions in. for example.phosphate buffered saline or water are suitable for injection. Examples of suitable topical formulations are gels, ointments, solutions or suspensions. The acyl derivatives C1 20 of the compounds of the present invention have antimycoplasmal activity and are useful in treating or preventing this disease in swine and poultry. The following Examples illustrate the present invention without. however. limiting the same thereto. All temperatures are expressed in degreesCelsius.

Acetoxymethyl 2,3 Diacetoxy l propyl Ether To a stirred mixture of 17.1 ml 20.8 g. 200 mmole of glycerol formal containing a mixture of the compounds of formulas III and IV, there was added 60 ml of acetic anhydride, 6.7 ml of glacial acetic acid, and 2.0 g of anhydrous ZnC12. The mixture was stirred at ambient temperature under an N2 atmosphere. The ZnCl2 soon dissolved. and within a few minutes there was a strong exothermic reaction with the color of the solution turning light amber.After one hour. by which time the exothermic reaction had subsided, thin layer chromatography TLC 1 1 and 21 hexane ethyl acetate showed an apparently complete and clean reaction. After 4.5 hours. the solution was concentrated under high vacuum. The residual oil was taken up in 700 ml of diethyl ether and washed with 2 X 100 ml of a saturated NaHCO3 solution. and then with 100 ml of H2O. The ether solution was dried over MgSO4, decolorized with charcoal, and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under high vacuum to give 45.8 g 92S of colorless residual oil. Analytical HPLC 7 3 hexane ethyl acetate showed only the two product isomers of formula V and VI.The bulk of the two product isomers 44.5 g was subjected to HPLC in four batches of from 11 to 11.5 g each. All runs were performed under identical conditions using silica gel two Waters Prep 500 packs , 7 3 hexane ethyl acetate 250 ml per minute flow rate with recycling three cycles and refractive index detection.

The mixture gradually thinned enough to stir, and a clear distillate was slowly collected. The reaction mixture became a clear solution after about 75 minutes. After 3 hours the solution was cooled, and the product was induced to crystallize.After standing, the thick mixture was diluted with a small volume of l,2 dimethoxyethane. The solid was collected on a filter and washed with small volumes of 1,2 dimethoxyethane followed by ethyl acetate to give 3.27 g of cream colored crystals consisting of a mixture of 9 and 7 alkylated isomers as determined by TLC 9 1 CHC13 MeOH .

An exotherm occurred. and after 1 hour TLC 2 1 hexane ethyl acetate indicated complete reaction. The solution was concentrated under high vacuum. The resulting liquid was dissolved in ether and washed thoroughly with saturated NaHC03 solution, then with H2 0. The ether layer was dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated to give 8.68 g of residual oil consisting of a mixture of the compound of formula VI major and the compound of formula V minor . This material was combined with 3.50 g from a similar batch. The total of 12.18 g o e product was purified by preparative HPLC on silica gel in 7 3 hexane ethyl acetate with recycling.

EXAMPLE 4Bromomethyl 1,3 Diacetoxy 2 propyl Ether Acetoxymethyl 3 diacetoxy 2 propyl ether 250 mg, 1 mmole was dissolved in dichloromethane presaturated with hydrogen bromide gas at 00. The mixture was protected from moisture and stirred at 0 for 2 hours, then allowed to warm to ambient temperature with loss of excess hydrogen bromide. After three hours the solvents were removed under aspirator vacuum. The evaporation residue was treated successively with two 10 ml aliquots of dichloromethane. which were evaporated under aspirator vacuum. Finally the residual oil was dried under high vacuum until the sharp odor of hydrogen bromide was no longer evident. The resulting material may be used immediately in alkylation reactions. Proton magnetic resonance spectra of CDCl3 solutions showed an appropriate downfield shift reflecting the change from AcOCH O to BrCH2O. EXAMPLE 5 Chloromethvl 1,3 Diacetoxv 2 ProDYl Ether A solution of 4.34 g 17.5 mmole of acetoxymethyl 1,3 diacetoxy 2 propyl ether in 45 ml of methylene chloride was stirred at room temperature as a gentle stream of HC1 was passed through it.After 2 hours the HC1 stream was removed. The flask was stoppered and allowed to stir overnight at room temperature. Then the flask was placed in a water bath at 25 30 , and the solution was purged with a stream of N2 to remove most of the excess HC1. The remaining solution was concentrated by rotary evaporation. In order to remove traces of HCl, the residual oil was taken up in toluene and concentrated under high vacuum at room temperature. This process was repeated three more times. After vacuum drying at room temperature, the yield of colorless residual oil was 3.83 g 97 . The NMR spectrum indicated complete conversion to product.

Although this cream colored solid 4.6 g gave a single spot on TLC 80 20 2 CHCl3 MeOH H2O , NMR showed that it contained 10 15 of the 7 alkylated isomer in addition to the desired 9 isomer. The material was combined with 0.6 g of similar material from other runs and was suspended in 184 ml of acetic anhydride. The mixture was heated at 970 for 18 hours by which time nearly all of the solid had dissolved, and TLC showed complete acetylation. The reaction was cooled and concentrated under vacuum. Treatment of the residue with 200 ml of methylene chloride gave a solid, which was isolated by filtration and washed once with methylene chloride.Recrystallization from methylene chloride gave 0.55 g of pure 9 isomer. The filtrates were passed through a column containing 40 g of silica gel. Elution with 97 3 CH2C12 MeOH gave 4.5 g of partially purified product. Upon recrystallization from methylene chloride about 45 ml , 3.0 g of pure 9 isomer was obtained. EXAMPLE 7 9 1,3 Diacetoxy 2 propoxymethyl guanine A mixture of 50.0 g 0.33 mole of guanine, 33 g of ammonium sulfate, and 2.2 1 of hexamethyldisilazane was stirred at reflux under N2 for 3 days. during which time all of the solid dissolved.The solvent was then removed by distillation under reduced pressure. To the very viscous, orange residual oil was added under N2 84 g 0.34 mole of acetoxymethyl l,3 diacetoxy 2 propyl ether. which formed a second liquid phase at the bottom of the flask. The flask was fitted with a distillation adapter. and the mixture was heated under low vacuum in an oil bath at approximately 1350. After an induction period lasting several minutes. boiling began and soon became quite vigorous. Distillation of trimethylsilyl acetate along with any residual hexamethyldisilazane proceeded rapidly at first but slowed after 30 minutes. After 2 hours the mixture was added to 1.3 1 of 90 EtOH. The mixture was heated to boiling and maintained there until the separated gummy material was transformed to a tractable solid.The solid 8.2 g. consisting almost exclusively of guanine was removed by filtration while hot. The filtrate was allowed to stand overnight, resulting in separation of an orange brown gum. Tne supeLnatant was decanted away from the gum, filtered, and then concentrated to small volume. The solid which separated on concentration was collected on a filter and washed with H2O. then with someEtOH, to give 15.4 g of cream colored crystals. ByNMR, this material was solely the 9 alkylated isomer, although TLC indicated partial side chain deacetylation. The material was suitable for deprotection without further purification. Further processing of the mother liquor, and of the gum which had been removed by decantation, gave additional crops consisting of varying ratios of 9 and 7 alkylated isomers partially deacetylated .These less pure crops were preferably converted to fully acetylated derivatives O,O ,Nê triacetyl prior to chromatographic purification silica gel.elution with CH2C12 MeOH . Typical acetylation conditions consisted of stirring a mixture of 10 g of the crude guanine derivative and 400 ml of acetic anhydride at 95 100 overnight, followed by concentration and chromatography.

EXAMPLE 12Sodium 9 1,3 Dihydroxy 2 propoxymethyl guanine cyclic monophosphate A suspension of 5.91 g 23.2 mmoles of anhydrous 9 1.3 dihydroxy 2 propoxymethyl guanine in a solution of 3.6 g 2.2 ml 23.6 mmoles of phosphorous oxychloride in 60 ml of anhydrous triethyl phosphate was stirred at room temperature for five hours. The largely clarified mixture was filtered, and the filtrate was poured into 600 ml of stirred hexane.After about five minutes the supernatant hexane was decanted from the precipitated product, and the residue was heated with a second 600 ml portion of hexane.After the supernatant hexane was decanted and the residue was dried in vacuo, 15.9 g of a solid product was obtained. The solid was largely dissolved in 800 ml of deionized water and the cloudy mixture was titrated to pH 7 with SN potassium hydroxide and then 1N potassium hydroxide. The neutralized mixture was filtered and the filtrate was lyophilized yielding 9.25 g of product. A specimen of the lyophilization residue was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography using a Whatman Partisil TM PXS 10 25 SAX ion exchange column with 0.05M pH 6.6 phosphate buffer elution and ultraviolet absorption detection at 252 nm. The prods exhibited three peaks with retention times of about 4 minutes, 7 minutes and 9 minutes. After authentic specimens of sodium and potassium 9 1,3 dihydroxy 2 propoxymethyl guanine cyclic and acylic monophosphate were isolated as disclosed in this and other examples in this patent application and subjected to high performance liquid chromatography in the above system, the cyclic monophosphate was associated with a retention time of about 4 minutes and the acyclic phosphate with a retention time of about 7 minutes. The lyophilized mixture of potassium salts was dissolved in 1 liter of deionized water and filtered through a fluted filter paper. The filtrate was slowly passed through a 4 5 cm diameter column of 460 ml 644 milliequivalents of 200 400 mesh Bio Rad AG1 X8 anion exchange resin on the bicarbonate cycle. Next, a gradient of O.O5M 0.5M potassium bicarbonate from a gradient elution chamber containing 2 liters of 0.05M and 0.5M potassium bicarbonate was pumped through the column and fractions of about 20 ml were collected at 8 minute intervals. At fraction 191. the eluent was changed to 0.5M potassium bicarbonate and samples of 20 25 ml were collected at 6.8 minute intervals.The elution pattern was monitored by ultraviolet absorption at 252 nm and certain component fractions of the various elution peaks were further characterized by high performance liquid chromatography in the Whatman PartisilTM PXS 10 25 SAX ion exchange column using 0.05M pH 6.6 phosphate elution. On the basis of these data certain fractions were combined and worked up as follows Fractions 450 540 1680 ml characterized by a single peak with a retention time of about 5 minutes in the above high performance liquid chromatography system. were combined and treated with 600 ml 1020 milliequivalents of 200 400 mesh Bio Rad AG50W X8 cation exchange resin on the acid cycle. The stirred mixture was kept under a modest vacuum to remove carbon dioxide before it was filtered.The mixture was filtered and the resin was washed with small portions of deionized water. The combined filtrates were concentrated to a 150 ml volume in vacuo at about 350 and the precipitated product. in the form of the free acid, was isolated by filtration and dried in vacuo to yield 445 mg of 9 1,3 dihydroxy 2 propoxymethyl guanine cyclic monophosphate. The product was crystalline according to microscopy in polarized light, showed an ultraviolet absorption maximum at 252 nm E 10600. in O.1M pH 7 phosphate , and gave a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum fully in accord with the projected structure. Concentration of the mother liquors yielded an additional 46 mg of the free acid form of the product. Titration of the mother liquors to pH 7 followed by lyophilization yielded 196 mg of sodium 9 1,3 dihydroxy 2 propoxymethyl guanine cyclic monophosphate.The latter compound. may at times be contaminated with small amounts of water soluble inorganic salts and may be purified by exclusion chromatography or by ion exchange chromatography on BioRad AG1 X8 anion exchange resin on the formate cycle. The pure sodium salt was also obtained by titration of the crystalline free acid as follows A suspension of 213 mg of crystalline 9 1.3 dihydroxy 2 propoxymethyl guanine cyclic monophosphate was titrated to pH 7 with 1N sodium hydroxide and the solution was lyophilized yielding 227 mg of sodium 9 1,3 dihydroxy 2 propoxy methyl guanine cyclic monophosphate. A dried sample of this product had an ultraviolet absorption maximum at 252 nm 11800 in 0.1M pH 7 phosphate . The 200 MHz NMR spectrum of the cyclic product in D2 0 is characterized by signals from two equivalent methylenes that have shifted downfield on monophosphorylation. The spectrum is characterized by the following chemical shifts. 3.94 EMI28.1 m 1H JH,H gem 12.5 Hz .25 P O CH eq d,d,d 2H JP OCH eq 19.5 Hz JH,H vic eq 2.2 Hz JH,H gem 12.5 Hz 44.39 P O CH d.d,d 2H JP OCH ax 5.0 Hz JH,H vic ax 1.8 Hz F5 .64 N CH2O s 2H 7.99 C8 H s 1HAdditional confirmation of structure is obtained when the predicted pattern of shifts is realized for theP O CH2 groups on irradiation of the EMI29.1 proton. In a Varian AX 10 high performance liquid chromatography anion exchange column using a gradient of 10 1000 mM unbuffered KH2PO4, the cyclic product has a retention time of 4.3 minutes whereas the enzymically derived acyclic monophosphate has a retention time of 4.8 minutes. The synthetic cyclic monophosphate is clearly separated from the acyclic enzymically derived monophosphate when a mixture of the two is subjected to HPLC in the above system. As an alternative, the sodium or potassium salt of the cyclic monophosphate may be isolated from the Bio Rad AG1 X8 bicarbonate eluate fractions without isolation of the crystalline free acid. A combination of fractions amounting to about 800 ml of 0.5M KHC03 was treated with 325 ml 552 mmoles of 200 400 mesh AG50W X8 cation exchange resin on the acid cycle. The stirred mixture was kept under modest vacuum for fifteen minutes to remove carbon dioxide and was filtered. The filtrate was concentrated to about a 100 ml volume which was then titrated to pH 7 with 1N sodium hydroxide.Lyophilization of the resulting solution yielded 529 mg of the sodium salt of the cyclic phosphate that was contaminated with a small amount of water soluble inorganic salts. To desalt the product, 200 mg of the sodium salt was dissolved in 1.5 ml of deionized water and put on a 1.5 cm diameter column of 6 ml of Bio Rad 200 400 mesh AG1 X8 anion exchange resin on the formate cycle. After about 35 ml of deionized water was passed through the column, elution was begun with 2N ammonium formate solution. Fractions of 3.5 ml volume were collected at 3 minute intervals and the ultraviolet absorption at 250 nm of each fraction was measured and plotted versus tube number. On the basis of the shape of the curve obtained in the above plot, fractions 13 28 were combined and put on a 2 3 cm diameter column of 120 ml 204 milliequivalents of 200 400 mesh Bio Rad AG50W X8 cation exchange resin.The column was eluted with water and 13.5 ml fractions were collected at 4.5 minute intervalsThe elution pattern was monitored by ultraviolet absorption at 252 nm and on the basis of the plot, fractions 22 40 were combined and concentrated to dryness. The residue was taken up in 10 ml of deionized water and titrated to pH 7 with 0.1N NaOH. tyophilization of the neutralized solution yielded 106 mg of sodium 9 1,3 dihydroxy 2 propoxy methyl guanine cyclic monophosphate. EXAMPLE 13Disodium 9 1,3 dihydroxy 2 propoxymethyl guanine acyclic monoPhosDhate Preparation 1 In the phosphorylation of 9 1,3 dihydroxy2 propoxymethyl guanine with phosphorus oxychloride to yield the corresponding cyclic monophosphate, the crude condensation product was purified by ion exchange chromatography on Bio Rad AGL X8 C03 . In the course of elution with 0.5 M potassium bicarbonate as described in the example for preparation of the cyclic monophosphate, a discrete peak consisting of fractions 245 248 was separated and found to contain the corresponding acyclic compound dipotassium 9 tl,3 dihydroxy 2 propoxymethyl guanine acyclic monophosphate. Using aPartisil PXS 10 25 SAX high performance liquid chromatography column and elution with 0.0SM pH 6.6 phosphate buffer, this peak contained material with retention times of about 5 and 8 minutes. The authentic acyclic monophosphate is associated with a retention time of 7 8 minutes in the same system.Analysis of this crination of fractions on a VarianAX 10 high performance liquid chromatography anion exchange column using gradient elution with 10 400 mM unbuffered KH2PO4 showed that about 40 of the material was dipotassium 9 1.3 dihydroxy 2propoxymethyl guanine acyclic monophosphate.Preparation 2 A solution of 44.5 mg of sodium 9 1,3dihydroxy 2 propoxymethyl guanine cyclic monophosphate in 4 ml of 5N sodium hydroxide was heated at 55 600C under a nitrogen blanket for eight hours.The reaction mixture was diluted to a 12 ml volume with deionized water and passed slowly through a 30 ml 2 cm diameter X 12 cm length column of Bio RadAG50W X8 cation exchange resin on the sulfonic acid cycle. The column was eluted with deionized water and 5 ml fractions were collected at 4 minute intervals. After fraction 60 was collected, 12 ml fractions were collected every 4 minutes.The various fractions were evaluated by ultraviolet absorption at 252 nm and also by high performance liquid chromatography on a PartisilTM PXS 10 25 SAX anion exchange column using 0.05M pH 6.6 phosphate buffer elution. Fractions 45 64, which consisted exclusively of material with a retention time of about 7.5 minutes were combined, titrated to pH 7 with 0.1N sodium hydroxide and then lyophilized to yield 30 mg of disodium 9 1,3 dihydroxy 2 propoxymethyl guanine acyclic monophosphate.

When the reaction is complete 24 hours the mixture is cooled and evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The residue is resuspended in ice water 50 ml and the pH is adjusted to 2 with 2NHC1.

EXAMPLE 29Comparative Solubilities in PH 7.2 Buffer at 250Solubilities were determined by suspending an excess amount of the compound in approximately 0.15 molar phosphate buffer pH 7.2 and shaking overnight in a water bath at 250 to give a saturated solution. The concentration of the compound in the filtered solution was calculated on the basis of spectrophotometric measurements, i.e. comparison of the ultraviolet absorbance at thes max for the saturated solution with the absorbance value observed for a known concentration of the compound.The results were summarized as follows Compound Solubility mg ml Acycloguanosine 1.3 1.5Compound of Formula I 3.6Compound of Formula II 2.8 EXAMPLE 30Phosphorylation of Compounds of Formula I and II and of Acycloquanosine by Herpes virus induced ThymidineKinase 30 pg of compound of formula I dissolved in 30 pl of 508 dimethylsulfoxide DMSO were incubated in a final volume of 150 1 for 3 hours at 370 with 50 mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 2.5 mM adenosine triphosphate, 2.5 mM magnesium chloride.7.5 mM phosphocreatine. 2 units of creatine kinase, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 2.5 mM sodium fluoride, 50 vg of bovine serum albumin and 0.0014 units of thymidine kinase, isolated from virus infected HeLa cells HSV1 virus , at a multiplicity of 10, 10 virus particles per cell , harvested 8 hours post infection by the method of CHENG OSTRANDER Journal of BiologicalChemistry, 1976, vol. 251, p 2605 . Two similar mixtures, one containing 30pg of compound of formula II and the other 30pg of acycloguanosine, both in 50 DIM50 were similarly treated. A fourth mixture, similar to the above but containing only 30 1 of 50 DMSO and no anti viral compound was also treated similarly as a control. At the end of the 3 hour incubation period.10 ul samples of each of the mixtures were analyzed by HPLC using an AX 10 column and a potassium phosphate KH2PO4 gradient elution 0.01 to 1.0M . The amount of the monophosphate derivative of each anti viral compound was estimated by integration of the area under the respective chromatographic peaks. The results indicated that 16 of acycloguanosine was converted to the monophosphate.derivative while 90 of compound of formula I and 95 of compound of formula II were converted to the respective monophosphates under the same conditions. To the rest of the incubation mixtures were now added 0.04 units of guanosine monophosphate kinase and 20 1 of an extract of HSVl infectedHeLa cells The cells were infected with the virus at a multiplicity of 10 and harvested 8 hours later they were suspended in a solution containing 0.35 M KH2 PO4s pH 7.5, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2S polyoxyethylene 9 octylphenol Nonidet P 40 , 14 glycerol at 50 mg ml and after 30 minutes at 40 were centrifuged at 100,000 mg the supernatant liquid was the crude extract. Incubation was continued at 30 for 4 more hours, after which samples were analyzed by HPLC and the amount of the triphosphate derivatives of each compound determined by integration of the area under the respective chromatographic peak.The results indicated that 31 of acycloguanosine was converted to the triphosphate under these conditions as compared to a conversion of 55 of compound of formula I and 93 of compound of formula II to the respective triphosphate derivatives. Since phosphorylation is presumed to be a prerequisite for the anti viral activity of these compounds, the higher rate of phosphorylation of compounds of formula I and II to the monophosphate and triphosphate derivatives represents a considerable improvement over acycloguanosine. EXAMPLE 31Enzymatic Preparation of the Acyclic Monophosphate ofCompound of Formula II The compound of formula II 25 mg was incubated at 370 in a mixture containing 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 bovine serum albumin, 1 mg m1 adenosine triphosphate, 5 mM magnesium chloride,, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phosphocreatine, 1 mM creatine kinase. 12.5 units ml sodium fluoride 2.5 mM and 500 units of purified HSV1 induced thymidine kinase, in a total volume of 10 ml.

EXAMPLE 34Enzymatic Preparation of the Triphosphate of Compound of Formula II The compound of formula II 20 mg was incubated at 370 in a 10 ml mixture containing Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mM magnesium chloride, 2.5 mM adenosine 5 triphosphate. 2.5 mM bovine serum albumin, 500 mg ml dithiothreitol, 2 mM phosphocreatine, 7 mM creatine kinase1 12.5 units ml sodium fluoride, 2.5 mM HSV1 induced thymidine kinase. 400 units and guanosine monophosphate kinase, 80 vg. Incubation was continued for 4 hours at 370 and for 20 hours at 300. The progress of the reaction was monitored by analytical high performance liquid chromatography.The product was isolated by HPLC chromatography on a preparative anion exchange column AX 10, Varian and then rechromatographed on an analytical column, Zorbax NH2 to remove contaminating ATP. The product was desalted by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose DEAE with triethylammonium carbonate pH 7.6 as the eluting solvent. Freeze drying of the pooled fractions containing the product yielded 15 mg of the triphosphate derivative of compound of formula II, the purity of which was confirmed by analytical HPLC. EXAMPLE 35Competition Between Thymidine and Acycloguanosine orCompound of Formula II for Phosphorylation by theVirus Induced Thymidine Kinase 1 20 pg of acycloguanosine dissolved in 20 pl of 50 DMSO was incubated iu a total volume of 120 pl 0.75 mM with 80 mM Trrs HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mM adenosine triphosphate, 4 mM magnesium chloride, i.7 mM dithiothreitol, 12. EM phosphocreatine, 5.0 mM sodium fluoride, 100 pg bovine serum albumin, 2.5 units of creatine kinase and 0.006 units of thymidine kinase, isolated from HSV1 infected HeLa cells as per Example 22 . Incubation was carried out at 370 for 2 hours and then continued at 300 for 18 hours. 2 A second mixture containing the same ingredients as mixture No. 1 plus 2.5 mM thymidine was incubated in the same manner. 3 A third mixture containing the same ingredients as mixture No. 1 but with 20 pg of compound of formula II replacing the acycloguanosine was incubated in the same manner. 4 A fourth mixture containing the same ingredients as mixture No. 3 plus 2.5 mM thymidine was incubated in the same manner. At the end of the incubation the amount of each anti viral compound converted to the corresponding monophosphate derivative was determined afterHPLC analysis by integration of the areas under the chromatographic peaks column and elution conditions as in Example 22 . The percent of monophosphate present at the end of incubation in the four mixtures was as follows Compounds PercentMixture No. present monophosphate 1 Acycloguanosine 27 2 Acycloguanosine Thymidine O 3 Compound of Formula II 93 4 Compound of Formula II BR Thymi ine 23 The results indicated that compound of formula II is phosphorylated by tulle viral thymidine kinase even in the presence of a large excess of thymidine whereas acycloguanosine was not phosphorylated at all under the same conditions. Since pbc phorylation is a prerequisite for the anti viral activity of these compounds and since thymidine is a normal constituent of the cells, the compound of formula II represents a significant improvement over acycloguanosine. EXAMPT,E 36 Comparison of the Kinetic Parameters ofAcycloguanosine and Compound of Formula II withPurified Viral Thymidine Kinase A series of mixtures containing in a total volume of 100 pL 22 pmoles potassium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 0.3 pmoles MgCl 0.5 pmoles of adenosine triphosphate 100 pg of bovine serum albumin 20 units of HSVl induced thymidine kinase and varying amounts of either compound of formula II or acycloguanosine, labeled with radioctive carbon 14C at position 8 of the guanine ring were incubated for 15 minutes at 370. At the end of this period, 80 pL aliquots from each tube were applied to circular filter papers 2.5 cm diameter of diethylaminoethyl cellulose Whatman DE81.Five minutes later, the filters were placed into a beaker with water and washed successively once with water.twice with 50 ethanol containing 0.5 mM guanosine.and once with absolute ethanol. They were then placed in scintillation vials, dried in a stream of air, and counted in a scintillation counter after addition of scintillation mixture Aquasol 2, NewEngland Nuclear . By this procedure, unphosphorylated compounds were washed away and only phosphorylated derivatives adhered to the DE81 filters thus the radioactivity counted was a measure of the conversion of the substrates, compound of formula II or acycloguanosine, to their phosphorylated derivatives by the action of the viral thymidine kinase. Proper controls for background radioactivity were included in the assays and used to correct the results. The number of moles of phosphorylated derivatives present in each assay tube at the end of the incubation period was calculated from the number of counts of radioactivity measured for each filter and the specific activity counts per minute per mole of each substrate in the assay mixtures. The data were plotted in a graph of reaction velocity versus substrate concentration. Figure 1 is a graph of the computer generated theoretical curves best fitting the actual experimental data. The curve obtained in a similar experiment with thymidine as the substrate is included in Figure 1 for comparison. The kinetic parameters Km, VmaxandV K for the two substrates were computed from max m the same data. The values obtained by averaging three separate experiments like the one described above were as follows Compound of Formula II Acycloquanosine Km pM 66 426Vmax pmoles min 280 61Vmax Km 4.25 0.14 Inasmuch as the ratio Vmax Km is the most commonly used measure for comparing substrate efficiencies, the relative efficiencies of compound of formula II and acycloguanosine as substrates for the HSVl induced thymidine kinase are 4.25 to 0.14 or 30 to 1. EXAMPLE 37Comparison of the Kinetic Parameters of Acycloguanosine and Compound of Formula II with Purified Guanosine MonoPhosPhate Kinase A series of mixtures containing in a total volume of 700 l 70 vmoles Tris acetate buffer at pH 7.6 70 vmoles KC1 7 pmoles MgCl2 2.8 pmoles ATP 1.05 pmoles phosphoenolpyruvate 175 pg bovine serum albumin 0.15 vmoles reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NADH 3 units lactic dehydrogenase 1.5 units pyruvate kinase and varying amounts of either acycloguanosine monophosphate or the monophosphate of compound of formula II are incubated at 250 with guanosine monophosphate kinase from hog brain Boehringer Mannheim in the cuvette of a Cary spectrophotometer recording the absorbance at 340 nm. In this coupled spectrophotometric assay the rate of phosphorylation of the monophosphate substrates to the corresponding diphosphates is calculated from the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm of the NADH.Since acycloguanosine monophosphate is a much poorer substrate for the kinase than compound of formula II monophosphate, more enzyme is used in the case of acycloguanosine monophosphate 0.28 units than in the case of compound of formula II monophosphate 0.0056 units . The initial velocities obtained in the above experiment are used to compute the kinetic parameters of the two substrates which are presented in the following table. The parameters obtained in a similar experiment for deoxyguanosine monophosphate are included for comparison Compound of Formula II Acyclo Deoxy Monophos guanosine guanosine phate monophosphate monophosphate Km M 22 316 124Vmax pg min mg 7.1 0.20 17.2 V Km 0.32 0.00065 0.14 max The relative efficiency of compound of formula II monophosphate and acycloguanosine monophosphate as substrates for the enzyme which converts them to the respective diphosphates is 0.32 0.00065 or 492 to 1. EXAMPLE 38Enzymatic Preparation of the Acyclic Monophosphate ofCompound of Formula I The compound of formula I 1 mg was incubated at 370 in a mixture containing 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 6.5 bovine serum albumin, 1 mg ml adenosine triphosphate, 5 mM magnesium chloride, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phosphocreatine 1 mM creatine kinase, 12.5 units ml sodium fluoride, 2.5 mM and 20 units of purified HSV induced thymidine kinase, in a total volume of 0.5 ml. The progress of the reaction was monitored by high performance liquid chromatography HPLC . When 65 of the compound of formula I had been converted to the monophosphate, the reaction was terminated.The product was purified by HPLC chromatography on a preparative anion exchange column AX 10, Varian and desalted by chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose DEAE with triethylammonium carbonate pH 7.6 as the eluting solvent. Freeze drying of the solvent from the pooled fractions containing the product yielded 500 pg of compound I monophosphate, the purity of which was confirmed by analytical HPLC.

In vivo Antiviral Activities of Cyclic Monophosphate Against HerPes Simplex Virus Animal Model Infection Systems. 1. Animal Model Systems Evaluated. Model herpes infection systems have been established to simulate clinical herpetic infection.a. Lntraperitaneal HSV 1 infection in mice results in a systemic infection with involvement of liver and spleen. viremia and eventually the central nervous system. Animals develop encephalitis. Drug efficacy given by oral gavage is evaluated by extension of animal survival time compared to placebo treated animals. Animals are challenged with 50 to 100 lethal equivalent doses of HSV 1 5 10 X 102 plague forming units .b. A direct encephalitis can be established by intracerebral HSV 1 inoculation. This model infection is used to determine whether drug delivered parenterally can effectively cross the blood brain barrier. Infection is in weanling mice for ease of intracerebral inoculation. Drug efficacy. given subcutaneously. is measured by extension of animal survival time.c. HSV 1 orofacial infection of hairless mice results in a localized acute herpetic infection, with the classic progression from raised erythematous area through ruptured blisters to scab formation. The majority of infected mice survive and harbor latent ganglionic infection, which can be activated by removal and co cultivation of the trigeminal ganglia from HSV 1 infected mice. Drug evaluation is based on prevention of development of local orofacial lesions, at a time of maximum involvement in placebo treated infected mice 7 days after infection . This model has been used to evaluate both orally and topically applied drug.d. HSV 2 vaqinal infection in mice is progressive from local acute infection of the genital area to limb paralysis and eventual death. This is a consistent, reproducible model. but is more virulent and progressive than the human genital disease. Drug efficacy is determined ultimately by extension of animal survival time, and also by the limitation of progression of disease from acute local through paralysis to death. Animals are challenged using in excess of 10 lethal equivalent doses of HSV 2. This model was used to evaluate dosing by oral gavage.e. Infection of rabbit eyes with HSV 1 results in punctate and or dendritic herpetic corneal lesions within 3 days. Infection progresses to involve greater than 80 of the corneal surface and progresses to deeper stromal involvement within 6 to 8 days in untreated rabbits. Some animals eventually succumb to encephalitis. Drug efficacy is evaluated by suppression of corneal and stromal lesion development compared to placebo treated infected animals. Drugs were delivered by eye drops applied 5 times daily. Lesion severity was evaluated by slit lamp microscopy daily prior to drug treatments. The data summarized in Table VI were determined from dose response drug titrations. Minimum effective dose is determined as the dose which results in a significant increase in survival time or a significant decrease in local lesion severity compared to placebo treated animals. Treatments were initiated within 3 hours of infection for intraperitoneal, intracerebral, orofacial and vaginal infections. Treatments of corneal HSV 1 infection of rabits were initiated 3 days after infection. a time at which herpetic lesions were evident. See Table VI for results.

Treatment was continued twice daily for 10 days. 2. Conclusions.a. The Cyclic Monophospate was an effective anti herpetic agent when used orally or topically in herpes model infections.b. As determined by minimum effective dose, theCyclic Monophosphate was consistently more efficacious than acyclovir against intraperitoneal.intracerebral, orofacial, and vaginal infections of mice. The Cyclic Monophospate and acyclovir were equally effective in limiting progression and resolving the corneal lesions of infected rabbits. c. Although not shown in Table VI, the antiviral efficacy of the Cyclic Monophosphate in the herpes mouse infection model tested was generally equivalent to that devloped using the compound ofFormula II.d. The Cyclic Monophosphate was therapeutically effective when treatment was initiated up to 72 hours after HSV 2 vaginal infection see Table VII .Comparable treatments suing acyclovir were ineffective in altering the progression of vaginal infection to paralysis and death. The Cyclic Monophosphate has consistently shown in vivo antiviral activity, as measured by minimum effective dose, comparable to that for the compound of Formula II and consistently superior to that generated by acyclovir. By contrast. the CyclicMonophosphate is about 10 fold less active than either the compound of Formula II or acyclovir against HSV infection in cell culture. Why theCyclic Phosphate is so effective in vivo is as yet unexplained, but compared to the compound of FormulaII and acyclovir, it is readily soluble,iwhich may influence absorption and distribution to the tissues. Significantly, however, the CyclicMonophosphate. is. surprisingly, substantially more effective than acyclovir or the compound of FormulaII in vitro against Varicella Zoster virus.In view of the fact that the Cyclic Monophosphate appears to perform substantially better in vivo than in vitro it is expected that in the therapeutic use in mammals its comparative effectiveness would be even more substantial. C. Mode of Action As implied from the different antiviral specificities observed for the Cyclic Monophosphate and the compound of Formula II e.g., enhanced activity of the Cyclic Monophosphate againstVaricella Zoster virus, vaccinia, SV40 and adenoviruses , the Cyclic Monophosphate does not appear to function primarily as a prodrug for the compound of Formula II, but instead has an independent mechanism of antiviral activity s . Further evidence for this can be demonstrated by the following Biological Activities of the Cyclic Monophosphate are not Dependent on Viral Thymidine KinaseIn vitro data 1. The in vitro antiviral activity of the compound of Formula II against HSV 1 was readily reversed by addition of thymidine e.g. ED50 of the compound of Formula II was 0.8 1.6 pg ml in the absence of thymidine and 25pg ml in the presence of 20ug thymidine ml, a greater than 15 fold reduction of antiviral activity. By contrast, addition of thymidine reduced that ED50 by 2 to 4 fold for theCyclic Monophosphate, from 12.5 pg ml to 25 50 pgXml. 2. An HBV 1 mutant resistant to the compound ofFormula II, HSV 1 383R1 , has been isolated fromHSV 1 strain Schooler, HSV 1 383R1 is approximately 100 fold less susceptible to protection by the compound of Formula II, but only 4 to 8 fold less susceptible than wild type to the CyclicMonophosphate. HSV 1 383R1 has retained about 10 20 of the HSV 1 capacity to phosphorylate thymidine, but is incapable of phosphorylation of the Compound ofFormula II. The Cyclic Monophosphate and the compound ofFormula II have been evaluated for antiviral efficacy against HSV 1 and HSV 1 383R1 in cell cultures deficient in cellular thymidine kinase 3T3TK and in cell cultures transfected to carry herpes TK. 3T3TK TK The The results are shown in TableVIII. As indicated by the previously described biochemical studies, the antiviral activity of the compound of Formula II is dependent on expression of viral TK. The compound of Formula II is equally effective against HSV 1 infection of 3T3 TK or 3T3 TK TK HSV cells or against HSV 1 383R1 in 3T3 TK TK HSV cells ED50 0.06 pgpl , but is 100 fold less active against HSV 1 383R1 in 3T3 TK cells ED5055.0 pg ml . By contrast, the antiviral activity of theCyclic Monophosphate is equivalent against HSV 1 383R1 on either 3T3 TK TK HSV cells or on 3T3 TK cells. Although the susceptibility ofHSV 1 to the Cyclic Monophosphate is about 5 fold greater than is HSV 1 383R1 , this difference does not correlate with the presence of viral TK.In vivo Data 1. Similar relative efficacies of the CyclicMonophosphate and the compound of Formula II have been observed for protection of mice against intraperitoneal Infection with HSV 1 or HSV 1 383R1 . Groups of mice infected intraperitoneally with increasing doses of HSV 1 or HSV 1 383R1 were treated twice daily subcutaneously for 4 days with either the Cyclic Monophosphate or the compound of Formula II. Mean survival times of treated mice were compared. There was no significant difference in protective efficacy of either drug against a 106 fold virus challenge range, e.g.protect ion could not be overwhelmed by increased virus challenge. However, the efficacy of the compound ofFormula II was significantly lower against resistant mutant HSV 1 383R1 than against wild type HSV 1 see Table IX . By contrast, the CyclicMonophosphate was equally effective against eitherHSV 1 or HSV 1 383R1 and equally as effective as the compound of Formula II against HSV 1.

Cyclic Monophosphate was equally effective against both viruses p 0.43 III. Genetic Studies Drug sensitivities of several HSV 1 andHSV 2 strains, altered by mutation in the DNA polymerase gene have been compared.In addition, by selection of intertypic recombinants of these HSV 1 and HSV 2 strains and fine mapping to determine the limits of the heterologous DNA polymerase genome inserts in the recombinants, a system useful for fine mapping drug resistance within the HSV DNA polymerase genome has been developed. It has been determined that the region of the viral DNA polymerase genome involved in resistance to the compound of Formula II mapped separately from the region s involved in resistance to PAA, acyclovir and adenine arabinoside. The same intertypic recombinants have been evaluated for sensitivity to the Cyclic Monophosphate, and the results are shown in Table X. Mutations in the DNA polymerase which produce an altered polymerase exhibiting resistance to PAA. acyclovir, and adenine arabinoside also appear to confer resistance to the Cyclic Monophosphate e.g. R6 34,R6 19, PAAR 1 However, HSV 2 Ts6, which is resistant to the compound of Formula II remains sensitive to PLAA, acyclovir. and the CyclicMonophosphate. The results indicate that the resistance to the Cyclic Monophosphate is closely linked to the region of the DNA Polymerase genome associated with resistance to PAA, acyclovir and adenine arabinoside. Furthermore, this region is distinct from the DNA sequences conferring resistance to the compound of Formula II. This implies that the Cyclic Monophosphate exerts a part or all of its antiviral activity in a manner independent of the compound of Formula II and its phosphate derivatives synthesized in the living system.

IV. Conclusions 1. Both in vitro and in vivo efficacy experiments indicate that the atitiviral activities of the Cyclic Monophosphate are independent of conversion to the compound of Formula II and that theCyclic Monophosphate is not a significant prodrug for the compound of Formula II. 2. Mutations in the HSV DNA polymerase locus can confer resistance to either the compound ofFormula II or the Cyclic Monophosphate independently. Resistance to the CyclicMonophosphate appears to be linked closely to resistance to acyclovir, phosphonoacetic acid and adenine arabinoside. These results imply that the inhibition of viral DNA polymerase is the result of different activated products of the compound ofFormula II and the Cyclic Monophosphate. EXAMPLE 44Treatment of Herpes Simplex Virus Infection in Mice Intraperitoneal Herpes Simple Type 1 Infection. OralTreatment ICR Ha mice were infected as described inExample 36. Groups of 10 infected animals were treated twice daily for 7 days by oral gavage at final daily doses of 100, 50, 12.5, 3.1 or 0.8 mg kg of acycloguanosine, or 50, 12.5, 3.1, 0.8 or 0.2 mg kg of the compound of formula II starting immediately after infection. In addition, two groups of five uninfected animals were treated with either acycloguanosine or the compound of formula II twice daily for 7 days by oral gavage at final daily doses of 50 mg kg. These animals served as toxicity controls. The summarized results are shown in TableXI.

Acycloguanosine treatment resulted in statistically significant extension of survival time compared to placebo treated animals only at 100 and 50 mg kg daily doses. All animals treated with 50 mg kg of the compound of formula II survived the test survival of the 50 and 12.5 mg kg treatment groups was statistically significantly longer than the placebo treated group. By contrast, none of the acycloguanosine treated groups showed enhanced survival. The relative potency of the compound of formula II to acycloguanosine was 50.3, which was statistically significant. There was no evidence of overt toxicity in either the acycloguanosine or the compound of formulaII treatment groups as measured by final weight of test animals. EXAMPLE 45Treatment of Herpes Simplex Virus Infection in Mice Vaginal HerPes Simple Virus Type 2 Infection1 OralTreatment. Thirty gram ICR Ha female mice were infected with more than 10 LD50 of Herpes simple virus type 2 Strain Curtis by the intravaginal route.

By contrast, only the 50 mg kg acycloguanosine treatment group showed statistically significant enhanced survival. The compound of formula II at 50, 12.5, 3.1 and 0.8 mg kg resulted in a statistically significant increase in survival time compared to placebo treated infected animals. Acycloguanosine at 50 and 12.5 mg kg was similarly effective. The relative potency of the compound of formula II to acycloguanosine as measured by survival was 28.1, which was statistically significant. All animals treated with the compound of formula II at 50 mg kg remained free of signs of herpetic infection for the duration of the test. The compound of formula II and acycloguanosine at both 50 mg kg and 12.5 mg kg resulted in statistically significant increases in the number of days to infection development of vaginal lesions and or paralysis compared to placebo treated animals. The relative potency of the compound of formula II to acycloguanosine as measured by time to infection was 4 14, which was statistically significant. EXAMPLE 46Treatment of Herpes Simplex Virus Infection in Mice Orofacial Herpes simplex Virus Type 1 Infection, OralTreatment. Twenty gram HRS hairless mice were infected on the abraded orofacial area with Herpes simplex virus type 1 Strain S . Groups each composed of 10 infected animals were treated by oral gavage twice daily for 7 days starting 3 hours after infection using final daily doses of 50, 12.5, 3.1 and 0.8 mg kg for acycloguanosine and 50, 12.5. 3.1, 0.8 and 0.2 mg kg for the compound of formula II. At 7 days after initiation of infection, the extent of lesion development in the orofacial area was measured on a scale of OF no lesions to 4 massive l esions over the entire snout . Lesion incidence and average lesion scores are shown in Table XIII and in Figure 2. The compound of formula II treatment resulted in statistically significant protection at all concentrations used compared to placebo treated infected animals when measured in terms of extent of lesion development. Acycloguanosine treatment resulted in statistically significant protection only at 50 and 12.5 mg kg doses. The compound of formula II treatment resulted in statistically significant protection at 50 and 12.5 mg kg doses compared to the incidence in placebo treated infected animals when measured in terms of incidence of lesions. By contrast, acycloguanosine treatment resulted in statistically significant protection only at 50 mg kg. The relative potency of the compound of formula II to acycloguanosine was 6.9, which r was statistically significant.

EXAMPLE 47Treatment of Herpes Simplex Virus Infection in Mice Orofacial Herpes simplex Virus Type 1 Infection.Therapeutic Oral Treatment Twenty gram HRS hairless mice were infected on the abraded orofacial area with Herpes simplex virus type 1 Strain S . a. Groups of 10 infected animals were treated twice daily by oral gavage for up to 7 days with the compound of formula II at 12.5 mg kg day, starting 3, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, or 96 hours after infection. b. In a second experiment, the therapeutic efficacy of acycloguanosine was evaluated in a similar manner. Groups of 10 infected animals were treated twice daily by oral gavage for up to 7 days with acycloguanosine at 12.5 mg kg day. starting at 3. 8. 12, 24. 48. 72, or 96 hours after infection. At 7 days after initiation of infection, the extent of lesion development in the orofacial area was measured on a scale of O no lesions to 4 massive lesions over the entire snout . Average lesion scores are shown in Table XIV. Infected mice receiving the compound of formula II starting as late as 72 hours after infection with HSV 1 showed statistically significant lower lesion scores than mice receiving placebo. By contrast, for acycloguanosine treatment, only mice receiving treatment starting 3 hours after infection were statistically different in lesion score than the placebo group. In addition, infected mice receiving the compound of formula II starting at 8, 12 and 24 hours after infection had a statistically significant lower incidence of lesion development than mice receiving placebo. None of the acycloguanosine treated groups had a significantly lower incidence of lesions than the respective placebo treated animals.

Method of Preparing Phosphate Derivatives of Compounds of Formula I and II The mono and polyphosphate derivatives of compounds of Formulas I and II may be prepared chemically by reacting a compound of Formula I or II with a phosphorylating agent such as phosphoryl chloride in a suitable aprotic solvent such as trietyl phosphate and treating the resulting intermediate with water or base. The major product of this reaction is the cyclic phosphate of compoundI or II, but acyclic mono diphosphates are also produced. The product ratios can be varied by changes in the amounts of the reactants or the length and temperature of treatment. It is also convenient to isolate the phosphorylated intermediate by precipitation with a nonpolar hydrocarbon solvent and quench with an alcohol. The product of this reaction can be either an alkyl phosphodiester or an alkyl phosphotriester derivative depending upon whether a basic aqueous treatment is employed or not. The phosphorylated derivatives of the compounds of formulas I and II namely the mono, linear di pyrophosphate , or linear tri phosphate can also be prepared enzymatically by treatment of the compound of formulas I or II with H5VI thymidine kinase to produce the monophosphate , additionally with guanosine monophosphate kinase to produce the pyrophosphate , and additionally with 3 phosphoglycerate kinase to prepare the triphosphate .
