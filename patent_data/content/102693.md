# Wire cut electric discharge machine.

## Abstract
In a wire cut electric discharge machine the accurate thickness of a workpiece 2 is obtained, on the basis of which electric cutting conditions are automatically changed over. The workpiece 2 and a wire electrode 1 are moved relative to each other through utilization of a servo feed system 12X, 12Y, 13X, 13Y to cut the workpiece 2 by discharge into a desired shape. Cutting current detecting means 8, 9 detect a true cutting current which contributes to electric discharge machining, and feed rate detecting means 6, 11 detect the relative feed rate of the workpiece 2 and the wire electrode 1 . Thickness detecting means 3, 11 detect the thickness of the workpiece 2 by caculation on the basis of the detected true cutting current and the width of a cutting groove separately input. Control means automatical ly change over the electric cutting conditions on the basis of the detection result by the thickness detecting means 3, 11 .
