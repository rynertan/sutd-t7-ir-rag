# Process for preparing alpha l aspartyl l phenylalanine alkyl esters.

## Abstract
A process for preparing alpha L aspartyl L phenyl alanine alkyl esters from L aspartic acid, of which the amino group is protected by bonding it to a 3,5 dimethoxy α, α dimethyl benzyloxycarbonyl group, then transforming this intermediate into the corresponding anhydride by means of a dehydrating agent, then reacting the anhydride with L phenylalanine alkyl ester, and finally eliminating the protective group by the action of U.V. radiation.
