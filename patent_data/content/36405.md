# Flow control device.

## Abstract
This disclosure relates to a flow control device in which the discharge from the nozzle is kept at essentially the same volume rate of flow in spite of fluctuations in the hydraulic pressure upstream from the device by providing a spray body 24 that has a group of radially disposed channels 25, 26, 27 which are perpendicular to the general direction of flow. A flexible spray control washer 10 spaced upstream from these channels 25, 26, 27 responds to hydraulic pressure by pres sing into the channels and restricting the flow area of each of these channels in proportion to the applied hydraulic pres sure. In this way, the flow area within the chamber is inversely related to the hydraulic pressure in order to maintain a con tinuous volume rate of flow through the device.
