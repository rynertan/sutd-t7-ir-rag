# Electron gun.

## Abstract
An electron gun 1 having a cathode 11 of a lanthanum hexaboride single crystal is disclosed in which the axis of the cathode 11 is set to such a crystal orientation that the elec tron beam has two intensive emission regions which are asymmetrical with each other in intensity. In the electron gun 1 , even at a low heating temperature of the cathode 11 , a single spot of an image by the electron beam of a more intensive emission region since the electron beam of a weaker intensity emission region is blocked by an aperture 2 .
