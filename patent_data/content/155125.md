# LEVEL SUBSTRATE FOR SEMICONDUCTING DEVICES AND METHOD FOR FABRICATING SAME

## Abstract
An improved semiconductor device includes a substrate 11 having a deposition surface, including at least one defect region 30, 32 capable of providing a low resistance shunt path or a nucleation centre, a relatively thick, con tinuous, electrically conductive leveling layer 26 electro plated on the deposition surface to provide a substantially defect free surface, and a semiconductor body 27 deposited on the leveling layer. The substrate 11 is formed of aluminium or stainless steel while the leveling layer is preferably formed of nickel or silver.
