# Process for continuously preparing ethylene glycol.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a process for continuously preparing ethylene glycol, which comprises 1 a first step of contacting a gas containing carbon monoxide and an ester of nitrous acid with a solid catalyst of platinum group metal series in the gaseous phase thereby to obtain a product containing a diester of oxalic acid, 2 a second step of condensing the product of the first step thereby to separate a non condensed gas containing nitrogen monoxide formed by the catalytic reaction of the first step from a condensed liquid containing the diester of oxalic acid, 3 a third step of contacting the non condensed gas of the second step with a gas containing molecular oxygen and an alcohol, and recycling the resulting gas containing an ester of nitrous acid to the first step, 4 a fourth step of contacting the condensed liquid of the second step containing the diester of oxalic acid and hydrogen with a catalyst for hydrogenation in the gaseous phase thereby to obtain a product containing ethylene glycol, 5 a fifth step of distilling the product of the fourth step thereby to distil out the alcohol and to obtain ethylene glycol, and 6 a sixth step of recycling the alcohol of the fifth step as an alcohol source for the third step.
