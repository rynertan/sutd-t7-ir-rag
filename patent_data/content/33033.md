# A Schmitt trigger circuit, for example for use in a dynamic MIS memory circuit.

## Abstract
Transistors Q₁, Q₂ and Q₃ are connected in series between a power source level line Vcc and a ground level line Vss. Node N₁ is connected to the gate of a feedback transistor Q₄ connected between the power source level line Vcc and node N₂. A further transistor Q If node N₁ is charged up to an abnormally high level as a result of an abnormal increase in power source level, when the power source level returns to a normal value and the level difference between the node N₁ and the power source level exceeds the threshold voltage of the transistor Q
