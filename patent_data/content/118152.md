# Heat responsive valve.

## Abstract
A safety valve responding to overheating conditions of the surrounding athmosphere, more specifically a combus tion gas inlet valve that closes when a fire declares. The valve uses a shape memory element 8 for detection and com mand. For the latter function it must be inside the valve, at the expense of sufficiently rapid detection of external temperature. This problem is solved by using a shape memory element that is in close contact with the valve housing 1 , e.g. countersunk in a groove in the internal wall of the valve housing. for facilitating conduction heat transfer.
