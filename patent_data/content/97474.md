# Writing instrument.

## Abstract
A writing instrument which uses ink of low viscosity has its barrel 1 partitioned into an ink chamber 10 and a storage cavity 6 by a partition tube 5 . The storage cavity 6 is closed by an absorbent closure member 4 which supplies ink to the pen 2 , and has an air intake tube 8 . The ink chamber 10 communicates with the storage cavity 6 through an air liquid interchange passage 7 . On increase of pressure in the chamber 10 ink is supplied to the storage cavity 6 through passage 7 for use by the pen 2 , while, on decrease of pressure, ink within cavity 6 is returned to the ink chamber 10 . Thereby, the amount of ink held by the cavity 6 is restricted and leakage of ink from the pen 2 prevented.
