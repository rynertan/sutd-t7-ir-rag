# A method of producing a half tone reproduction.

## Abstract
A method is disclosed for making a half tone reproduc tion of an original image by exposing an output surface OS , for example a film wrapped around a rotating drum, to a scanning beam e.g. a modulated, multiple head laser beam. The modulation of each scanning beam, of which there may be several SB,SB1 , is determined by a control signal generated by a generating digital position signals representing the position of the scanning beam SB1 within a half tone dot area DA of an imaginary, electronic , screen grid SG inclined at a screen angle Î² to a horizontal line on the output surface OS , each successive position x in the screen grid being computed by the repeated addition of small increments to the previous position signals, and, at each successive position, the position signals being com pared with a predetermined value to detect the crossing of the border of the dot area DA b comparing each of the said position signals with a picture signal representing the picture density at the corres ponding point of the original image to be reproduced and c combining the results of the said comparisons to generate the control signal. The picture signal determines the size of the dot required, and hence the position in the screen grid of the dot border DB . Its comparison with the position signals thus indicates the required output modulation. For simple hard dots, as shown, this is an on off modulation, the control signal being on 1 or off 0 , at successive points x of the scan. The computer may however derive a multiple level output modulation control signal, to give soft dots of any shape.
