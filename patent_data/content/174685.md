The tests fall into two categories, pre erergence and post emergence. The pre emergence tests involved spraying a liquid formulation of the compound cato the soil in which the seeds of the plant species mentioned above had recently been sown. The post emergence tests involved two types of test viz., soil drench and foliar spray tests. In the soil drench tests the soil in which the seedling plants of the above species wel e growing was drenched with a liquid formulation containing a compound of the invention, and in the foliar spray tests the seedling plants were sprayed with such a formulation. The soil used in the tests was a prepared horticultural loam. The formulations used in the tests were prepared fram solutions of the test compounds in in acetone containing 0.48 by weight of an alkylphenol ethylene oxide condensate available under the trade mark TRITON X 155. These acetone solutions were diluted with water and the resulting formulations applied at dosage levels corresponding to 5 kg or 1 kg of active material per hectare in a volume equivalent to 600 litres per hectare in the soil spray and foliar spray test, and at a dosage of level equivalent to 10 kilograms of active material per hectare in a volume equivalent to approxmately 3,000 litres per hectare in. the soil drench tests. In the pre ertergence tests untreated sown soil and in the post emersen tests untreated soil bearing seedling plants were used as controls. The herbicidal effects of the test compounds were assessed visually twelve days after spraying the foliage and the soil, and thirteen days after drenching the soil and were recorded on a 0 9 scale. A rating 0 indicates growth as untreated control, a rating 9 indicates death. An increase of 1 unit on the linear scale approximates to a 10 increase in the level of effect.
