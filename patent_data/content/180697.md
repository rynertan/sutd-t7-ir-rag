# Fire retardant polyurethane foam containing finely ground dry fire retardant particles containing a volatile active fire retardant component.

## Abstract
A molded polyurethane foamed shape has finely ground dry fire retardant particles containing a volatile active fire retardant component which releases fire retardant gas when exposed to fire and distributed throughout the shape and encapsulated by the polyurethane so as to protect the component against evaporation until exposed by initial burning of the shape.
