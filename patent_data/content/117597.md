# Method for the fabrication of a double walled construction element and the construction element obtained through that method.

## Abstract
A method for the fabrication of a double walled construction element and the construction element obtained through that method, wherein said method includes the following steps machining an unexpanded solid block 3 in honeycomb to predetermined dimensions in such a way that the honeycomb in expanded situation fills up the total space between the outer and inner tubular elements 1, 2 , said expanded honeycomb 3 being in close contact with adjacent surfaces of the inner and outer tube respectively, expanding the machined block, fixing one face of the expanded honeycomb to the inner tube 1 , calibrating the opposite face of the honeycomb, assembling the outer tube 2 over said opposite face, fixing of the opposite face of the honeycomb to the outer tube. A construction element as achieved with said method represents a very high resistance to fatigue load under dynamic charges, since the honeycomb, its walls extending normal or substantially normal to said tube faces, has a diverging effect of the charges.
