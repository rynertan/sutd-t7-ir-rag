## Description
A DEVICE FOR REMOVABLY CONNECTING HOLLOW CYLINDRICALELEMENTS IN MASTS FOR SAILING TRANSPORT MEANS DESCRIPTION Tie present invention relates to a device for removably connecting two coaxial hollow cylindrical nale and female elements, respectively, which can be telescoped into each other for a predetersined length and belong to two mast sections or to a naet top and to a mast heel or to a last cap in lasts for transport loans, particularly light sailing boats, such as boarders, wind surfe and the like. The light boats and transport means of the abovedefined kind, particularly the socalled wind surfs, are provided with a mast generally formed of an aluminium tube having a length of 4,40 4,60 meters, which is intended to be removably secured to the hull by means of an articulated joint and to be closed at the upper end by a cap which retains the sail in position, These so long masts present problems of transport either on vehicle roofs or in airplanes, as well as storage pro blems and it would be therefore advisable for them to be severed in at least two coaxial elements. However, this severing involves the need of providing a connecting device which can be quickly and readily locked and unlocked and assures at the same time a perfect retention of the strength characteristics of an integral mast, and this under the operative and environmental conditions in which the transport means of concern are. This device, under the above mentioned conditions, could be applied also in the case of the removable fastening of the mast heel to the articulated joint as well as the cap to be mast head.Particularly in the case of multiple use it is advisable that the above mentioned connecting devices are in a position to impart to the mast a good hermetic seal not only with respect to the solid matters which can penetrate it but also, in the case of boats, with respect to the water which would unduly make heavy the last when it is hoisted from the liquid surface to the operative position on the wind surf. In accordance with the invention and in order to achieve the above raeritioned advantageous characteristics, there is provided a removably connecting device for the particularities and applications mentioned in the introductive part of the description, which device is essentially characterized in that it comprises at least a packing means movable on the surface of one of the two substantially hollow cylindrical elements facing the other of the two substantially hollow cylindrical elements from a first steady position in which said substantially hollow cylindrical elements are unlocked, through an instability area to a second steady positionein which said substantially hollow cylindrical elements are locked to each other by squeezing of said packing means therebetween, said movement being determined by the dragging action of the other of said substantially cylindrical elements in the axial in , sertion and extraction movements thereof. In particular, said packing means is a socalled 0 ring having a toroidal shape circular in cross section and of elastic material assuring a substantial water seal to the joint, although this joint is made by hand iii a very simple manner, by axial forced insertion movement of the two elements. This insertion movement causes a rolling movement of the packing means on itself, with displacement from the first to the second positions both defined by circumferential seats provided on one of the facing gurfa ces of the substantially hollow cylindrical elements to be coupled. In the second position the 0 ring is elastically deformed and locks thereby the two hollow cylindri cal element, by exerting the necessary sealing action and imparting the desired strength characteristic to the connection. These and other features of the invention will be now described in connection with an embodiment thereof, illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Figs,l qnd 2 show in a different scale a front view partially broken away of a piast for light sailing transport means, formed according to the invention Figs.3 and 4 show a side view of the connecting device in an unlocked and a locked condition of its components, re specti vely. As already said, this invention finds a particular even if not exclusive application in light sailing transport means, whichare movable on sand, land, ice, water or the like. In particular, the application that at present is considered of most interest is in masts of the light boats such as boarders, wind surfs and the like, which masts have often a not excessive length in order to permit an easy transport and storage thereof and which, for example in the case of wind surf 5, are removably connected at one end to an articulated joint secured to the body and at the opposite end are provided with a closure element, called cap , which cooperates in retaining in position the sail threaded on the mast.Both to avoid the penetration of foreign matters which can damage the mast and to prevent the penetration of water which would make the lifting operation of the mast during sailing very hard, it is advisable to provide hermetically sealed connections. In particular, the mast 10, for example made of aluminium, is formed of two coaxial hollow slightly of frusto conical cylindrical elements lOa, tOb orany other geometrical shape, which are locked to each other by an intermediate connecting device 12. Such a connecting device l2a is provided at the mast heel, between the lower end thereof and a male support 14 pivotally collected through a buffer 16 to the wind surf body, indicated at 18. Also the upper portion 10a of mast terminates with a socalled cap 20 inserted into the free upper end of the mast and locked thereto by means of a connecting device 12b according to the invention. The above mentioned connecting device 12 wS11 be now described in more detail in the Figs.3 and 4, wherein such device is shown applied to the removable connection between two elements 10a and lOb of the mast 10. The connection device comprises two male and female coaxial hollow cylindri cal portions 22 and 24 which are so dimensioned that the male portion 22 can penetrate the female portion 24 for a sufficient length to assure a desired strength of the assembly, the penetration degree being determined by an abutment 26 provided on the mast element carrying the male portion, against which the free end of the female portion 24 abuts. The end zone of the male hollow cylindrical portion 22 is shaped as shown in the Figrires, for example by a local defonnation operation of the surface, such as rolling or the live, s as to form two circumferential seats 28 and 30 being axially spaced from each other and having a different depth. More particularly, the seat 28 is formed by a groove the bottom of which is closer to the axis 32 of the hollow cylindrical portions than the bottom of the groove forming the seat 30. Furthermore, both seats 28, 30 are connected to each owner by a shaped section outwardly projecting from the bottom of the seats with respect to the axis 32. More particularly, this shaped section as a substantially cylindrical top wall 34 and two side wall 36,38 inclined towards the seats 28 and 30, respectively. The wall 36 inclined towards the seat 28 has a lower slope than that of the wall 38 inclined towards the seat 30. In these seats and therebetween a movable packing means is placed, which is formed of a toroidal elastic element 40, circular in cross section Oring and which in the unlocked condition of the two hollow cylindrical portions 22, 24, lies within the seat 28 facing tse female portion 24. By pushing this female portion 24, starting from the position of Fig.3 in the direction of the arrowsX indicated in this Figure, relative to the male portion 22 a rolling movement of the 0being 40 above the shaped section 34 38 occurs until the Wring enters the seat 30, which movement occurs together with that of insertion of the two portions 22, 24, until the position indicated in Fig.4 is reached, wherein the portion 24 is against the abutment 26. In this condition, the connection is operative and the two portions 22, 24 are locked to each other and axially retained, in a sufficient manner for the application of the invention, by the friction exerted by the O ring 40 within the seat 30,where it is squeezed, and by the ramp formed by the wall 38. To unlock the connection it will be sufficient to exert an axial force in the direction of the arrows Y in Fig.4 on the portions 22, 24 to cause a rolling movement of the 0being 40 until it will be against into the seat 28, thereby unlocking the two mast elements. It is to be noted that while the seats 28, 30 and the shaped section 4 38 have been illustrated as formed on the male portion 22, the device can operate as well if the shaped section and the seats are provided on the female portion 24, while the male portion is provided with a smooth surf ace.
