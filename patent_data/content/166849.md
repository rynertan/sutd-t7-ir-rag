# Method of preparing high cis 1,4 diene polymers having good green strength and tack.

## Abstract
Diene poiymers naving a hign content of cis 1,4 addition are prepared by polymerizing a 1,3 diene monomer in a hydrocarbon solvent in the presence of a catalyst composi tion comprising a a carboxylated metal oxy borate com pound in which the metal is nickel or cobalt, b an organometallic compound of a metal of Groups I, II, and III of the Periodic System, and c one or more fluorine containing compounds selected from the group consisting of boron trifluoride complexes with ethers, alcohols or mixtures thereof hydrogen fluoride hydrogen fluoride complexes with ethers, alcohols, or mixtures thereof and mixtures of said compounds. The resultant polymers exhibit good green strength and tack and are particularly suitable for use as tire rubbers.
