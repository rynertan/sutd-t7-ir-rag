# Centering device for a constant velocity joint.

## Abstract
A constant velocity joint 10 comprises an input shaft assembly 12 and an output shaft assembly 14 , each shaft assembly 12, 14 including a cylindrical end 30, 32, and 50, 52 received within a respective pair of arcuate surfaces 40, 42, and 60, 62 in the housing 16 . A pilot assembly 70 is disposed between the input shaft assembly 12 and output shaft assembly 14 , with pin 90 extending between pilot members 76, 86 of the pilot assembly 70 . The pilot members 76, 86 have complementary shaped angled faces 78, 88 for surface to surface sliding engagement with each other, the pin 90 extending through the centers of angled faces 78, 88 whereby the longitudinal center lines AO, XX, BO of the pin 90 and pilot members 76, 86 intersect at the same point 0 .
