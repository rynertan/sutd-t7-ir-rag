# A method for increasing the cross flow microfiltration fluxes of waste waters containing suspended solids and or emulsified oil.

## Abstract
A method for increasing the cross flow microfiltration fluxes of waste waters containing suspended solids and or emulsified oil through microporous thermoplastic tubes 32 by including therein a calcium compound selected from Ca OH ₂ or CaSO₄. The calcium compound is present in the waste waters in an amount ranging from above the solubility limit of the compound to about forty 40 percent by weight of the waste waters. The Ca OH ₂ can be added directly to the waste water. The CaSO₄ can be included by reacting H₂SO₄ and Ca OH ₂ in the waste waters to form CaSO₄ in situ. Alternatively, wet CaSO₄ can be formed by reacting H₂SO₄ with Ca OH ₂ outside the water and then added to to the waste waters in the required amount.
