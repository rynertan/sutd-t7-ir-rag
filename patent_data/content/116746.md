## Description
APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR MEASURING REFRACTIVE INDEX OF LIQUIDS Background of the InventionField of the Invention This invention relates generally to an apparatus and method for measuring the refractive index of a liquid. More particularly, this invention relates to a refractometer and method for measuring the refractive index of a liquid using polarized light that is reflected off of a prism li√∫id interface.Description of the Prior Art A refractive index of a material relates to the optical density of that material. In many materials, the refractive index correlates with mass density or concentration of the material. For instance, it is possible to determine the percentage of sugar in water by measuring the refractive index of the solution. The refractive index N Gi 6r where 4i equals the angle of incidence and er equals the angle of refraction. A critical angle of refraction is the angle wherein a refracted ray changes to a reflected ray. The critical angle of refraction Gc is equal to the arc sineN2 N1 wherein ec is equal to the critical angle within the first material, N1 is equal to the refractive index of material 1 and N2 is equal to the refractive index of material 2 providing N2 is less than N1. As can be seen, the concentration of a solution may be determined by either measuring the angle of refraction or measuring the change in the critical angle of refraction. Conventional reflection refractometers use the critical angle method of measurement. Reflection refractometers measure the reflected light from the surface of the prism of a known refractive index that is in contact with a liquid to be measured. This permits either transparent or highly colored liquids to be measured. Critical angle refractometers usually focus a beam of light on the surface of a prism and or scan the beam or detector system mechanically in an attempt to locate the critical angle. The critical angle can then be related to the refractive index of the liquid.These focusing and mechanical scanning techniques present numerous possibilities for malfunction or error in the measurement of the critical angle. The scanning that the conventional reflection refractometers use require moving parts that may wear or change position. The moving parts add additional cost to the refractometer, as well as the previously mentioned possibilities of malfunction or error. To date, there has been no known apparatus for measuring the refractive index of a liquid by measuring reflected polarized rays of light from the liquid being measured. The present invention addresses the problems associated with the prior art devices and methods which require a refractometer to measure the critical angle which may then be correlated to a refractive index. The present invention provides a simple, accurate and inexpensive method and apparatus for measuring a polarized reflected ray to be used to determine the refractive index of the liquid being measured. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention includes an apparatus and method for determining a refractive index for a liquid.The refractometer system includes a light source for emitting light.

The prism access door 39 has a port 39b into which a hose barb 46 is operatively connected. The port 39b is in fluid communication with the opening 39a for purposes that will be more fully described hereinafter. A detector, generally designated at 53, is aligned to receive a reflected portion of the polarized light beam, as will be more fully described hereinafter. The detector 53 includes a beam splitting prism 60 that is secured to a mounting base 61 by means of a mounting clamp 62 and screw 64 The mounting base 61 is in turn secured to a detector mounting base 54 which is mounted to the base plate 25 by screws 63. A first detector includes a detector lens 55 mounted in a detector lens housing 56. A photo diode detector 57 is mounted in a detector mount 58. The detector mount 58 is cooperatively connected to the detector lens housing 56. A coaxial cable 59 is operatively connected to the signal output photo diode detector 57.A detector mount clamp 65 and screw 66 are used to secure the detector lens housing 56 and detector mount 58 to the detector mount base 54. A second detector is conpriiied of individual Components similar to the first detector and is like wise mounted to the detector mount 54.

A covar gasket 70, is secured to the edges of the cover 69 to provide for a fluid tight seal along the base plate 25 and an opening in the cover 69 for the prism mounting panel 37. In operation, a liquid 75 to be measured flows through the hose barb 46. The liquid 75 flows from the hos barb 46 to the opening 39a of the prism access door 39. This places the liquid 75 in contact with the first surface 38a of the prism 38. The liquid 75 and the prism 38 form a prism liquid interface, generally referred to as 76. It is understood that the abovedescribed embodiment allows for a continual flow through of liquid 75. It is understood that the refractometer system 10 could easily be modified to test single samples of liquids. Light emitted from the light source 11 is projected along the axis 36 through the collimating optics 12 and band pass filter 13 to the polarizer 14.The polarized beam from the polarizer 14 is directed toward the prism liquid interface 76. The polarizer 14 is adjusted such that the polarized beam leaving the polarizer 14 is 45 to the plane of incidence of the prism 38 and the plane of incidence of the beam splitting prism 60. This 450 beam can conveniently be thought of as made up of two superimposed rays or linerally polarized light having equal strength. One of the rays is polarized with its electric field vector parallel to the plane of incidence, and is called the P polarized ray. The other ray is polarized with its electric field vector orthogonal to the plane of incidence, and is called the S polarized ray. The polarized beam of light enters the prism 38, which is preferably a sapphire prism, that has a refractive index of N1.The polarized beam strikes the reflecting surface of the prism 3B at an angle 41 81 is mechanically adjusted such that the working range of the instrument is less than the critical angle of the liquid being measured. A portion of the polarized beam of light is refracted into the liquid 75 at an angle 8 and is lost. Therefore, 9 is not measured directly. The remaining portion of the polarized beam that is not refracted into a liquid 75 is reflected off of the prism liquid interface 76 at the same angle as 81 and passes through to the detector 53. In the detector 53, the polarized beam strikes the beam splitting prism 60 where the S and P polarized rays are separated and directed to the photo diode detectors 57 and 57a.The photo diode 57 and 57a are respectively energized by the P and S polarized rays and produce electrical output signals proportional to the respective illumination energy levels of the S and P rays. The electrical output signals can be processed by appropriate electrical or electronic apparatus to extract information therefrom, to determine the refractive index, as will be more fully described hereinafter. In the preferred embodiment, such electrical electronic apparatus is generally referred to as the computer 73 however it will be understood that other appropriate electrical or electronic apparatus for performing the desired information extraction functions could be used.In the preferred embodiment, the computer 73, is preprogrammed to contain the values of the refractive index N1 and the angle of incidence 41 and can calculate the ratio of the S ray to the P ray from the signals received from the photo diode detectors 57 and 57a. This ratio of S P is equal to ratio R . In the preferred embodiment, the computer 73 is programmed or programmable to calculate the angle of the refracted light e by using the formula Tan e 1 Tan 41 R l R l . The refractive index N of the liquid 75 being measured can also be readily determined by use of the computer 73 by using the formula N N1 sine e1 sine 4 . It is understood that the polarized light beam may strike the plane of incidence at other than a 450 angle with appropriate modifications being made in the calculation of 9 and N. The refractometer 10 may be calibrated by using a series of samples of known refractive indexes across the range of the instrument and allowing the computer to interplate a smooth curve through all points. The computer may also contain the software for zero adjustment, span adjustment and conversion to other engineering units. The post detection, analytical portion of the apparatus, above referred to as the computer 73, may use either analog or digital disciplines to perform the data analysis or calculations. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the post detection analytical circuitry generally comprises a digital electronic, microprocessor controlled computation system suitable for converting the analog signals received at its input ports 73.1 and 73.2 into digital signals and for digitally processing those signals under program control to perform the desired calculations and signal manipulation functions. In the preferred embodiement, the computer 73 generally includes a power supply not illustrated , computation electronics and a digital read out display and key board terminal generally illustrated at 73.3 .In the preferred emobidment, the computer unit 73 supplies all of electrical power for the optics unit as well as for the computation and display functions. The computer includes standard microprocessor components such as a central processing unit, memory banks, analog to digital A D converters, etc. well known to those skilled in the art.In the preferred embodiment, a 16 bit microprocessor is used to perform the computation and linearization necessary to convert the photo detector readings into the desired refractive index or other engineering unit information such as refractive index, arid, sample temperature or other units such as BauJre . In the preferred embodiment, the operating program is stored in programmable read only memory PROM , and all other processing information including operator interface information and calibration data, is stored in battery backed random access memory RAM . Typical operator interface functions include zero , respan11, rrecalibrate , and numerous diagnostic functions. In the preferred embodiment, the diagnostic and special operator functions are self promoting and are presented on the same 20 character alpha numeric output display 73.3 which is used to display sample readout information. The details of such microprocessor controlled data processing systems are not presented herein, since those skilled in the art can readily construct and assemble appropriate circuitry and programs for use therewith to achieve the desired signal processing and calculation functions. The use of a highly efficient LED light source 11 and remote mounting of the power supply minimize sample compartment heating. The coolant tube 40 may also be used to stabilize the temperature of the liquid 75 being measured. It will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that many alternative circuits, configurations and analysis arrangements may be envisioned within the spirit and scope of this invention. In addition, a light source illumination intensity control is provided. The S beam amplified signal from the amplifier 72a is continually amplified by means of the feedback intensity control amplifier 74 which assures a constant amount of light to the S beam photo detector diode 57a. This intensity control feedback arrangement provides stability to the instrument and corrects for possible reading errors due to buildup of light absorbing material on the prism surfaces or bubbles in the liquid. It is also understood, that by appropriate formula changes, the refractive index could be determined from the ratio of P ray to the S ray, the S ray minus the P ray, or the P ray minus the S ray. Another advantage of the present refractometer system is that the intensity profile of most light sources are Gaussian across the beam cross section.This tends to make critical angle reflection instruments non linear and reflects their accuracy. The present refractometer 10 continually monitors the total beam cross section and is not affected by this. Further, there are no moving parts in the optic and optic detection sections of the refractometer system, thereby eliminating the inaccuracies that develop with conventional reflection refractometers and their scanning methods. Other modifications of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description. This description is intended to provide specific examples of individual embodiments zilch clearly disclose the present invention. Accord ingly, the invention is not limited to those embodiments or to the use of elements having specific configurations and shapes as presented herein. All alternative modifications and variations of the present invention which follows in the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims are included.
