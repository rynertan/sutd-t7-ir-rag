# Strut suspension structure of automotive vehicle with variable geometry.

## Abstract
A strut suspension for an automotive vehicle has its upper end connected to a suspension support which allows the upper end of the suspension strut 1 to shift in a direction oblique to the longitudinal axis of the strut in response to vertical movement of a vehicle wheel. Shifting of the upper end of the strut is controlled by means of a link member 43 rotatably connected to the upper end of the strut. The link member is rotatably connected to the suspen sion support 21 . This structure ensures negative camber during roll steer, anti dive characteristics, and weak under steer, and suppresses harshness by providing a suspension geometry which optimizes suspension characteristics de pending upon the vehicle driving conditions.
