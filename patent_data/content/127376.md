# APPARATUS FOR ELECTROSTATIC COATING OF POORLY CONDUCTIVE AND NON CONDUCTIVE MATERIALS

## Abstract
In the electrostatic application of a coating material on to a product to be coated, the product leaves a supply hopper 1 over a tube enlargement 5A and falls freely in a chamber 2 in the form of a tubular curtain. The tubular curtain falls around a central, elongate, vertical corona discharge elec trode 6 so that a high voltage electrostatic charge of one sign is applied to the falling curtain of the product. Coating mater ial is sprayed on to the product by atomizers A1 to A6 in the chamber 2 . A high voltage electrostatic charge of opposite sign is applied to the coating material by way of the atomizers A1 to A6 .
