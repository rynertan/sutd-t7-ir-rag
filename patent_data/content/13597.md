## Abstract
A signal path from A to C includes, as DC connected series elements, the base emitter path of a PNP input emitter follower transistor 40 and the base emitter path of an NPN output emitter follower transistor 50 . The junction of the series elements is connected by the collector emitter path of an NPN switching transistor 60 to a reference potential point ground and by a resistor 51 to a positive DC supply termi nal. With the switching transistor cut off, the emitter followers 40, 50 are biased into conduction to enable the signal path. With the switching transistor 60 rendered conducting under control of a switching signal SW the base emitter paths of both emitter followers are reverse biased with resultant dis abling of the signal path. In a dual standard color TV receiver, a pair of such signal paths are subject to complementary control of respective switching transistors 120, 130 to effect alternation of the operating mode of the receiver between a SECAM reception mode in which the SECAM chrominance component is transcoded into a quasi PAL format and applied to the input terminal A of one 30, 40, 50 of the paths, and a PAL reception mode in which the PAL chrominance compo nent is supplied to the input terminal B of the other path 90, 100 , the common output terminal C of the two paths leading to a PAL decoder operative for either mode.

## Description
SIGNAL SWITCHING APPA. iTUS The present invention relates generally to switching apparatus, and particularly to novel switching circuitry, which may advantageously serve, for example, in implementation of video signal switching functions in a dual standard color TV receiver. In the European Patent Application published asNo. 0003169, a dual standard PAL SECA3I color TV receiver arrangement is disclosed wherein standard PAL decoder apparatus is utilized a to decode, in conventional manner, a PAL encoded signal, when such a transmission is received, and b to decode a quasi PAL signal, developed by a SECk1 PAL transcorder operating in the general manner described in U. K. Patent No. 1,358,551, when a SECAM transmission is received.By use of a suitable identification system, such as described, for example, in theEuropean Application published as No. 0004445, the receiver may be automatically switched, in dependence on the SECAM or PAL nature of the transmission received, between 1 a SECAM reception mode of operation, in which the PAL decoder apparatus receives as its input a quasi PAL chrominance signal output of the SECAM PAL transcoder, and 2 a PAL reception mode of operation, in which the PAL decoder apparatus receives as its input PAL chrominance signals which bypass the transcoder and pass instead through an appropriate PAL chroma band pass filter. The present invention is directed to novel switching circuitry, convenient for realization in integrated circuit form, which may advantageously serve to effect the above described switching of PAL decoder input signals, with assurance of adequate prevention of crosstalk between the respective input signals. In accordance with the principles of the present invention, a signal path includes, as DS connected series elements, the base emitter path of an input emitter follower transistor of a given conductivity type, and the bareemitter path of an output emitter follower transistor of the opposite conductivity type. The junction of the series elements is connected via 1 a direct current conductive impendance, and 2 the collector emitter path of a switching transistor of said opposite conductivity type, to opposite terminals of a DC potential supply. The poling of the supply is such tat, upon cutoff of the switching transistor, the input and output emitter followers are biased into conduction to enable the signal path, whereas a rendering of the switching transistor heavily conducting results in revers biasing of the base emitter paths of both emitter followers to disable the signal path. In the disabled state of the path, the presence of a pair of high impedance series elements reverse biased base emitter paths wit a lo impedance shunt element conducting collectoremitter path at the junction thereof, assures strong attenuation of signals applied to the signal path input. In an illustrative application of the present invention to the switching of PAL decoder input signals in a dual standard PAL SECAM receiver, a first signal path of the above described type is interposed between the output of the transcoder and the PAL decoder input, while a second signal path of the above described type is interposed between the output of the transcorder bypassing path and thePAL decoder input.Complementary switching signals applied to the switching transistors of the respective signal paths alternatively a enable the first signal path to establishSECAM mode operation, while disabling the second signal path to isolate the PAL decoder input from the bypassing path and b e enable the second signal path to establish PAL mode Operation, while disabling the first signal path to isolate the PAL decoder input from the transcorder. in view of the above noted strong attenuation of input signals effected b the disabled signal path, operation of the dual standard receiver in either of its operating modes takes place without significant interference from the signal output of the non selected signal source. In the accorpanying drawings FIGURE 1 provides a bloc diagram illustration of a portion of a dual standard PAL SECAM color TV receiver incorporating a signal switching arrangement embodying the principles of the present invention and FIGURE 2 illustrates schematically circuitry for advantageous realization of the switchina arrangement ofFIGURE 1 pursuant to a particular embodiment of the preset invention. In FIGURE 1, composite video signals received b a dual standard PAL SECAM color TV receiver appear at an input terminal V, and are applied to the inputs of a cloche filter 11, a PAL chroma bandpass filter 23, and the receirTer s luminance channel not illustrated . Bandpass filter 23 has a passband encompassing the chrominance signal band associated with a PAL transmission.Filter 11 has a passband encompassing the chrominance signal band of aSECAM transmission, and is provided with a bandpass characteristic of a Cloche or bell shaped form, appropriately complementary to the characteristic employed for hig frequency pre emphasis of subcarrier side bands in SECAM signal formation. The output of filter 11 is supplied to a SECAM PAL transcoder 13. The transcoder 13 is illustratively of the general type described in U.K. Patent No. 1,358,551, wherein the respective SECAM subcarriers are demodulated sequentially by a frequency discriminator, and the resultant color differcnce signals amplitude modulate in appropriate sequence respective phases of a suboarrier of PAL subcarrier frequency.The suboarrier wave input for transcoder 13 is derived fro the reference oscillator of the receiver1 5 PAL decoder 19. For proper sequencing of operations in transcorder 13, an identification system 15, illustratively of the type described in the aforementioned EuropeanNo. 0004445 is coupled to transcorder 13. In the transcorder 13, a flip flop develops half line rate control waves es for use in switching the center frecueno tuning of the frequency discriminator employed for demodulating received SECAM signals.When the phasing of the flip flop output is correct, the discriminator is provided with center frequenc tuning appropriate for demodulation o the R Y SECAM subcarrier 4.40625 MHz during the image portion of a R Y line interval of the SECAM signal, and tuning appropriate for demodulation of the B Y modulated subcarrier 4.250 MHz during the image portion of a B Y line interval of the SECAM signal.Through the supplemental association of line rate, burst interval control waves, however, the timing of the changes in discriminator center frequency tuning is so controlled that during te lead in bursts preceding the image portions of both R Y and B Y line intervals, the discriminator center frequency tuning is the sac e. g., tuned for a center frequency corresponding to the R Y subcarrier .As a consequence of holding the same R Y subcarrier center frequency tuning for all burst intervals, there appears,in the fIltered output of the discriminator, pulses during alternate bust intervales which identify the successive occurrences of a particular B Y line interval. In the identification system 15, the filtered output of the transcorder s discriminator is applied to a pair of sample and hold circuits. Using respective half line rate control waves of mutually opposite phase derived from the flip flop, and common line rate, burst interval gating pulscs, for control of the sampling times of the respective sample and hold circuits, one sample and hold circuit effects sampling of the filtered discriminator output during the lead in burst occurrence of alternate line intervals, while the other samle and hold circuit effects a sampling of the filtered discriminator output during the lead in burst occurrence of the intervening line intervals. Comparison of the outputs of the two sample and hold circuits in a voltage comparator yields an output indicative of the correctness or incorrectness of the phasing flip flop circuit. When the output is indicative of incorrect flip flop phasing, the flip flop is shut down and then allowed to restart, whereupon a new comparison is effected, with such a process repeated until correct flip flop phasing is achieved. The identification system 15 also develops, via such voltage comparison, a switching control signal for effecting automatic control of the receiver s operating mode, in dependence upon the SECAM or PAL nature of the received signals. This switching control signal output of identification system 15 is applied to a control ten SW of electronic switching apparatus 17. Electronic switching apparatus 17 includes an array of six switch elements S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 and S6 a pair of signal input terminals A and B and a signal output terminal C. The signal output of transcoder 13 is applied to signal input terminal A of the switching apparatus 17, while the output of the PAL chroma bandpass filter 23 is applied to signal input terminal B. The signal output terminal C of switching apparatus 17 is coupled to the input of PAL decoder 19. The switch elements of switching apparatus 17 are illustrated as ganged for common control by the switching control signal applied to terminal SN, and these switch elements are illustrated in FIGURE 1 in the switching states that they assume when the switching control signal establishes a SECAM reception mode of operation. In tllis mode of operation, it is desired that the PAL decoder 19 receive the quasi PAL signal output of rtanscoder 13, while being isolated from the output of bandpass filter 23.In the illustrated switching states, switch elements S1, 52 and S6 are closed, and switch elements S3, 54 and 55 are opened.For the illustrated conditions, the transcoder output supplied to terminal A readily passes to output terminal C via closed switch elements SI and S2 in series diversion of such signals, via a shunt path interposed between the junction of switch elements S1 and S2 and a point of reference potential e.g., ground , is substantially precluded by the open condition o switch element S3 in such shunt path. Signal passage from input terminal B to output terminal C is obstructed by the presence of open switch elements S4 and S5 as the series elements in such path, and by the presence of a signal diverting shunt path presented by closed switch element S6 interposed between the junction of switch elements S4 and S5 and the reference potential point. Thus, delivery of the desired signal input quasi PAL signals produced b a SECAM PAL transcoder 13 to decoder 19 is obtained, while significant interference from the undesired signal output of PAL chroma bandpass filter 23 is precluded.The undesired signal is subject to strong attenuation by the divider formed by the high impedance series element represented by open switch S4 and by the low impedance shunt element represented by closed switch S6. The output of this divider is subject to further attenuation due to the subsequent high impedance series element represented by open switch S5. The PAL decoder 19 operates upon the quasi PAL signal, delivered to it by switching apparatus 17 under the illustrated conditions, in the manner described in the aforementioned U.K. Patent No. 1,358,551, to develop a set of color difference signals R Y, B Y and G Y, which are supplied to matrix 21 for corbination with a Y signal from the receiver s lurninance channel. The output of the matrix 21 comprises set of color signals R, B and G which mav be supplied to a conventional color kinescope for development of color images representative of the picture infraction contained in the received SECAM signals. When the switching control signal applied to terminal SW is appropriate for establishment of a PAL reception mode of operation for the receiver, the switch states of the respective switch elements of apparatus 17 are reversed from that illustrated in FIGURE 1 that is, switch elements S1, S2 and S6 are opened, and switch elements S3,S4 and S5 are closed. Under such conditions, signals from terminal B are passed to output terminal C via closed st elements S4 and S5, while the shunt signal diverting pa . represented by switch S6 is open circuited. Strong attenuation is provided for the output of transcoder 13 delivered to terminal A because of the high impedance state of series switch elements S1 and S2, and the low impedance state of the signal diverting path represented b closed switch S3. Under these conditions, the chrominance component of received signals of a PAL nature are passed b filter 23 and switching apparatus 17 to PAL decoder 19. Normal PAL decoding operations therein supply color difference information to matrix 21 for development of color signal outputs, which result in reproduction of color images representative of the picture information contained in the received PAL signal. In FIGURE 2, circuitry for implementing the functions of the electronic switching apparatus 17 of toFIGURE 1 receiver is illustrated sehematieall. As illustrated therein, signals applied to input terminal A are delivered to the base of an NPN transistor 30. The emitter electrode of transistor 30 is connected by a resistor 31 to the base electrode of a PNP transistor 40.The collector elcetrodes of transistors 30 and 40 are connected to opposite terminals of a B4 supply of the receiver, with toe collector of PNP transistor 40 connected to the negative terminal thereof illustratively at ground potential , and the collector of NPW transistor 30 connected to the positive terminal thereof illustratively at a 12 volt potentIal An NPN transistor 32 has its collector electrode connected directly to the base electrode of transistor 40, its emitter electrode returned to ground via an emitter resistor 33, and its base electrode connected to a point of 1.5 volt bias potential via a resistor 34. The emitter electrode of PNP transistor 40 is directly connected to the base of an NPN transistor 50.The collector electrode of transistor 50 is directly connected to the positive terminal of the B supply, while resistor 51 provides a direct current conductive path between the base electrode of transistor 50 and the positive terminal of the B supply. The emitter electrode of transistor 50 is directly connected to output terminal C.An NPN transistor 70 has its collector electrode directl connected to emitter electrode of transistor 50, its emitter electrode returned to ground via an emitter resistor 71, and its base electrode connected to a point of 1.2 volt bias potential. Signals appearing at terminal B are delivered t the base electrode of a PNP transistor 90. The collector electrode of transistor 90 is directly connected to ground. A resistor 81 is connected between the base electrode of transistor 90 and the positive terminal of the B supply.An NPN transistor 80 has its collector electrode directly connected to the base electrode of transistor 90, its emitter electrode returned to ground via emitter resistor 82, and its base electrode connected by resistor 83 to a point of 1.5 volt bias potential. The emitter electrode of PNP transistor 90 is directly connected to the base electrode of an NPN transistor 100. The collector electrode of transistor 100 is directly connected to the positive terminal of the s sut 1 , while a resistor 101 provides a direct current conductive path between said positive terminal and the base electrode of transistor 100.The emitter electroc .o of transistor 100 is directly connected to output terminal r, switching control signals appearing at termine are applied to the be of an NPN transistor 140. Th.t emitter electrode of transistor 14C is grounded, while the collector electrode of transistor 140 is directly connected to the base of a p transistor 130. The emitter electros of transistor 130 is connected via a resistor 121 to a point of 3.5 volt potential, while the base electrode of transistor 130 is connected to said point of 3.5 volt potential via a resistor 131. The collector electrode of transistor 130 is directly connected to the base electrode of an NpN transistor 110. The emitter electrode of transistor 110 is ground, and the base electrode is returned to groun via a resistor 111. The collector of transistor 110 is direct connected to the base of transistor 100. A PNP transistor 120 has is emItter electrode directly connected to the emitter electrode of transst 130, its base electrode connected ts a poInt of 2.1 volt potential, an its collector directly connected to the o an NPN transistor 60. The emitter electrode o 60 is grounded, and te base electrode of transistor 60 is connected to ground via a resistor 61.The collector electrode of transistor 60 is directly connected to the base of transistor 50. In the circuit arrangement cf FIGURE 2, the structure of switching apparatus 17 or FIGUP 1 is implemented 5 transistors 40, 50, 60, 90, 100 and 110, w the base emitter junction of transistor 40 serving as switchS1, the base emitter junction of transistor 50 serving as switch S2, the collector emitter path of transistor 60 serving as switch S3, the base emitter junction of transistor 90 serving as switch S4, the base emitter junction of transistor 100 serving as switch S5, and the collector emitter path of transistor 110 serving as switchS6.Control of the switching state of these transistors is effected by a differential amplifier formed by transistors 120 and 130 and driven by the swithcing signal input transistor 140. Illustratively, the swithcing control signal applied from terminal SW to the base of transistor 140 goes high to render transistor 140 conducting when theSECAM reception mode is to be established, and goes low to cut off transistor 140 when the PAL reception mode is to be established. When transistor 140 conducts in the former instance, transistor 130 is rendered conducting to turn on transistor 130, bringing the base of transistor 100 and the emitter of transistor 90 close to the ground potential. Under these c circumstances, tzransistor 120 and transistor 60 are cut off. Emitter follower transistor 30, together with resistor 31 and the current source formed by transistor 32 and its emitter resistor 33, comprise a DC level shifter wh supplies the quasi PAL signal input from terminal A to the base of transistor 40 while biasing the base of transistor 4C at a potential intermediate the potentials a opposite trerminals of the B supply.Resistor 81 cooperates with the current source formed by transistor 80 and its emitter resistor 82 to likewise bias the base of transisto 9C to which PAL input signals from terminal B are supplied at a potential intermediate the potentials at the opposite terminals of the B supply. When the above described switching conditions are established, i. e. cutoff of transistor 60, and conduction by transistor 110, the basr emitter paths of transistors 40 and 50 are forward biased by biasin current flowing ria resistor l In contrast, the base emitter paths of transistors 90 and lC0 are reverse biased, with the emitter electrode of NPt transistor 100 driven to a potential driven mere positive then its base electrode, and with the base electrode of PNP transistor 90 at Åa potential more positive then its emitter electrode, and the biasing current supplied by resistor 100 is diverted into the collector emitter path of conducting transistor 110. Passage of signals from terminal A to terminal C takes place via the conducting base emitter paths of transistors 40 and 50, while strong attenuation of input signals from terminal B takes place due to the high impedances presented b the series elements constituted by the reverse biased base emitter paths of transistors 90 and 100, and the low impedance shunt path presented b the conduction transistor 110. When the switching control signal at terminal SW goes low to cut off transistor 140, transistors 130 and 110 are cut off, and transistors 120 and 60 are driven into conduction to establish the PAL reception mode. With transistor 110 cut off, the base emitter paths of transistors 90 and 100 are forward biased by biasing curren supplied via resistor 101.With the base of transistor 50 and the emitter of transistor 40 brought close te ground potential by the conduction of transistor 60, the base emitter paths of transistors 40 and 50 are reverse biased, and the biasing current flowing in resistor 51 is diverted into the collector emitter path of conducting transIstor 60.Under these circumstances, input signals from terminal B pass to output terminal C via the conducting base emitter paths of transistors 90 and 100, while input signals from terminal A are strongly attenuated, due to the presence of the high impedance series elements presented b the reverse biased base emitter paths of transistors 40 an 50 and the low imtedance shunt path presented by conducting transistor G0. In the circuit arrangement of FIGURE 2, the base electrodes of the current source transistors 32 and 80 are biased from a common 1.5 volt supply. . The respective couplings to this supply are effected via respective decoupling resistors 34 and 83. The decoupling resistor prevent undesired coupling between the two inputs across the parasitic capacitances existing between collector and base of tle current source transistors.
