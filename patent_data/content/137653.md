## Description
This invention relates to a coupling device. The development of optical coupling and fibre optical coupling has resulted in the use thereof for passing data between different pieces of equipment or internally between parts of a single piece of equipment for example computer input and or output signals, switching signals, television signals, audio signals, and so on. Optical signals, unlike electrical signals, do not generate any induced signals and, therefore, fibre optics do not require any screening. In addition optical coupling can be used as a form of isolation between two items for example a power supply and a low energy circuit such as an intrinsically safe circuit. The presence of optical coupling prevents the intrinsically safe circuit becoming unsafe as might happen if there were to be a cross feed or flashover. However, while such optical isolation will deal with an electrical energy overload it cannot deal with the problems created by hot gases resulting from an explosion. According to the invention there is provided an explosion proof electrical optical coupling device for connecting together separate items of electrical equipment so that a signal can be passed between said equipment, said device comprising a body containing optical means for electrically isolating the equipment connected by the device, electrical connection to the isolating means for electrically connecting the coupling device to equipment, material surrounding both the isolating means and the electrical connection thereto, said material extending across the body to form a fluid tight, explosion proof barrier in the body, and the body being connectable to one of said items of equipment to form an explosion proof, threaded connection or an explosion proof connection by a circlip between the exterior of the body and the equipment, whereby an explosion in one of said items of equipment is prevented from being transmitted through the device to another item of electrical equipment connected thereto. The design of the body is not critical and is chosen to suit the particular equipment to which it is to be connected. If desired an adaptor can be fitted to the body to render it compatible with a piece of equipment and if necessary secured thereto and or to meet a specific standard relating to the prevention of explosion transmissions in this type of equipment. The invention in its simplest form contains only one isolation means for example an optical coupling. Where necessary additional isolation means can be included. In addition the body may house one or more electric conductors which have no isolation included therein. Any material can be used for forming the barrier. Preferred materials are epoxy or polyurethane resins or other hard setting resins which are preferably non reversible and not capable of being softened. Any other material which can form a fluid tight, explosion proof, barrier can be used. The body and material forming the barrier can be integral or alternatively the body can be a separate item in which material is disposed to form the barrier. Specific embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which In various embodiments similar parts have the same reference numbers. Referring to Fig.1 a body 10 contains an optical isolator 26 connected to pairs of leads 28 and 30 for connection to electrical circuits. The body may be externally threaded as at 12 for reception in the tapped hole of an electrical optical fitting or for location between two internal compartments of a piece of equipment. The coupling 26 and leads 28 and 30 leading to the coupling are surrounded by a compound 20, such as an epoxy putty, which extends across the width of the body and forms a fluid tight, explosion proof, barrier. Inturned flanges 22 and 24 at each end of the body or any other suitable internal protrusions or recesses, assist in keeping the compound in place. End pieces not shown may be fitted to the body to close it off to prevent any access to the filler compound. It is to be understood that the arrangement of Fig.1 is merely an example of a coupling within the invention. The number of connections and or isolators within the body can be increased. A single coupling device can include different kinds of connector or isolator and may additionally include electrical conductors with no break or isolator. Where the connector or isolator is unidirectional, a plurality of such connectors or isolators in a single device may be arranged in the same or in different directions. The exterior of body 10 can be modified to suit the equipment to which it is to be fitted. Examples are shown in Figs.2A 2C. For instance, as shown in Fig.2A the body can be unthreaded and held in place in a fitting by a circlip that is received in groove 32. Instead of being externally stepped as shown in the previous figure, the body may have a frusto conical head 34 as illustrated in Fig.2B. As shown in Fig.2C the body may have a portion 36 at one end thereof which is of reduced external cross section. In other words any other shape can be used which is adapted to be complementary to the mounting for the device. When the body is externally threaded the threads may be provided adjacent one end rather than along most of the length of the body. Such an embodiment can be received in an untapped aperture in a fitting and held in place by a nut within the fitting engaged on the threaded portion. Instead of flying leads or fibres as illustrated in the drawings a plug or socket may be provided at one or both ends thereof of the body for the purposes of connection. The plug or socket may be externally profiled to permit it to be used to engage the coupling device to a piece of equipment. The plug connection can be a push fit, a threaded connection or any other suitable fastening. Where an optical isolator is used which includes a radiation emitting diode, for example, adapted to transmit light radiation to a photo transistor circuit or any other suitable receiver, an amplifier may be necessary to restore the signal level. Such an amplifier can be included as an integral part of the coupling device of the invention or it can be adapted to be disconnected if desired. In addition it is not essential to use a receiver for radiation from the radiation emitting diode which produces a signal, for example a light emitting diode. Instead the presence of radiation from an emitter can be used to close a circuit, that is to say in the manner of a switch. In this way no additional current is generated a very useful feature if the coupling device of the invention is to be used in hazardous areas. An embodiment incorporating these features is illustrated in Fig.3. The body 10 contains a radiation emitter such as a light emitting diode 50 and a receiver such as photo transistor 52 contained in a matrix 54 through which the radiation can pass such as glass. A second matrix 56 contains a similar arrangement of emitter 58 and receiver 60 but arranged in the opposite sense to matrix 54. Leads 62 from the receiver 52 in matrix 54 and leads 64 from the emitter 58 in matrix 56 are taken to a terminal block 66 secured to the the body as by rods 68. Leads 70 from the emitter 50 in matrix 54 and leads 72 from the receiver 60 are taken to the other end of the body and may be terminated in a plug or left as flying leads as illustrated. Thus, for example, a circuit can be connected, via the terminal block to leads 64, which can be used to trigger a junction connected to the leads 72. When that junction has been completed a signal can be passed to leads 70 which in turn can actuate a circuit connected via the terminal block to leads 62. The invention also includes devices in which the input signal is converted from an electrical signal to an optical signal or vice versa. For example an electrical input signal can be used to energise a light source, such as a light emitting diode, the emission from which is received by optical fibres. The opposite arrangement is provided for example where the input is an optical signal, the emission from, for example, optical fibres, being received by a light sensitive means such as a photo transistor which produces an electrical signal. The electrical signal may be amplified if desired. An embodiment of the above kind is illustrated in Fig.4. A light emitting diode 80 is clamped to a plastic bush 82 by nuts 84 and the bush received in one end of the body 10. The connections 86 to the light emitting diode are soldered to leads 90 which extend from the other end of the body.
