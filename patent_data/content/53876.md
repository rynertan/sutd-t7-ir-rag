# Transparent polyamides.

## Abstract
A polyamide molding resin consisting essentially of a polycondensate composed of units of a 60 90 mole percent isophthalic acid, based on total acids present b 10 40 mole percent terephthalic acid, based on total acids present c 98 92 mole percent hexamethylene diamine, based on total amines present and d bis p aminocyclohexyl methane the mole percent of which is between a lower limit of 2 mole percent of the total amines present and an upper limit which is 1 11 of the mole percent of a present, and in which at least 59 percent by weight of the bis p aminocyclohexyl methane is either the trans, trans isomer or the cis, trans isomer, and having a melt viscosity at 280 C of less than 30,000 poises, can be used to provide transparent molded articles.
