## Description
This invention relates to a display unit of tachometer for automobile, in which liquid crystal bar graphic displaying is used. In the conventional tachometer of this type, it has been variously devised to give an alarm by some warning means such as change in color of tachometer, flickering of lamp, etc. when number of revolutions of engins exceed preset number of revolutions.However, in the prior art there has been no disclosure for any display means making it constantly possible to clearly judge a difference between actual number of revolutions of engine and preset number of revolutions, in spite of the intensified necessity for such display means, when actual number of revolutions of engine exceed preset number of revolutions or when actual number of revolutions do not reach preset number of revolutions. With the aforesaid points in view, this invention was achieved. Therefore, one of the objects of this invention is to provide a display unit of tachometer for automobile equipped with the technical means capable of displaying both actual number of revolutions ans preset number of revolutions of automobile engine at an inexpensive cost and in a manner of watching these revolutions readily on one and the same display device. Another object of this invention is to provide a novel display unit of tachometer for automobile capable of fulfilling various display functions with bar graphic displaying under the display formation by plane liquid crystal, displaying clearly high speed warning revolution area or high speed critical revolution area shown by yellow zone or red zone and giving simultaneously alarming effects by means of flickering and the like. Namely, this invention relates to a display unit of tachometer for automobile, displaying necessary number of revolutions of engine with scales at the basic scale units of each segment on a display device of bar graphic displaying provided with necessary number of segments, displaying constantly warning number of revolutions of engine by selectively driving only the segment displaying desired warning number of revolutions, displaying actual number of revolutions of engine by driving all the segments corresponding to number of revolutions other than the actual number of revolutions, or displaying number of revolutions exceeding the warning number of revolutions by stopping the driving of only the segment corresponding to the warning number of revolutions when the number of revolutions of engine exceed the warning number of revolutions and further displaying critical number of revolutions with the flickering of the display device by driving intermittently each segment when number of revolutions of engine reach preset critical number of revolutions. Referring now in detail to the accompanied drawings, description is made on the construction of one embodiment of this invention Fig. l is a block diagram illustrating the whole of one embo diment of display unit of tachometer for automobile according to this invention Fig. 2 is a front view of display device of the display unit and Fig. 3 a b c d are explanative views showing the display state of display device respectively.As to each segment of display device, oblique line portion shows working state, while line less portion shows inactive state. Numeral l is a display device which is formed as the bar graphic displaying A cimprising necessary number of segments 2 using, for example, liquid crystal. Namely, in the illustration, n piece segments 2 same in size of long and narrow plates are arranged and connected together, and each one piece of segments are displayed in sequence as one scale of basic units, for examples 100 rpm, 200 rpm and so on. Numeral 3 is scales shown on the necessary positions of the aforesaid display device i. And, in case of necessity, color displays may be made, together with the scales 3, with yellow for warning revolution area, red for critical revolution area, and so on. Accordingly, the display device 1 can display proper numerical values as a result of changes in condition of light and darkness, transparency and turbidity, etc. which are caused by the changes of optical properties of the liquid crystal relative to the necessary segment 2 on which voltage is impressed and are different from the liquid crystal relative to other segments on which no voltage is impressed. And also, the display device l may take the necessary construction easy to watch for a driver in the daytime and nighttime with transmitted light, reflected light, etc.by display means under DS dynamic scattering system, TN twisted nematic system, ECB electrically controlled birefringence system,PC phase change system, etc. according to the difference in the mechanism transforming the changes in condition of liquid crystal caused by electric signals into optical information. And further, as to the display device l, each segment 2 can freely be arranged, for example the arrangement in up to down direction, not to speak of the arrangement in right to left direction as shown, and can be constructed to desired shapes without limiting to the construction shown, while a number of display device l can be formed to circular arc, circle, circular ring, etc.as desired according to the shapes of segments. Numeral 4 is an engine revolution operational circuit which is so arranged as to receive ignition pulse signals of automobile engine and to operate number of revolutions per minute rpm of engine as desired. Numeral 5 is a warning revolution decision circuit, in which warning number of revolutions are selectively set to 5 500 rpm, and is connected to the operational circuit 4. And further, when number of revolutions per minute of engine are smaller in value than 5 500 rpm to the segment 2 corresponding to 5 500 rpm of the display device l through driving circuit 6 of the display device l, a warning revolution decision circuit 5 is capable of making the display device i perform liquid crystal displaying by means of giving optical changes of liquid crystal of the segment 2 through connecting wire 10 by the driving circuit 6 when number of revolutions per minute of engine are larger in value than 5 500 rpm, the warning revolution decision circuit 5 is so arranged as to enable the segment 2 corresponding to 5 500 rpm to stop its driving by stopping the functioning of the driving circuit 6. Numeral 7 is a critical revolution decision circuit, in which critical number of revolutions are selectively set to 6 000 rpm, and is connected to the engine revolution operational circuit 4. And further, when number of revolutions per minute of engine reach the value exceeding 6 000 rpm to the segment 2 corresponding to 6 000 rpm of the display device l through the driving circuit 6 of the display device l, the critical revolution decision circuit 7 is capable to making the display device l perform flickering display of all the segments 2 corresponding to the number of revolutions per minute responding to higher speed by giving intermittently the display inhibiting signals to the driving circuit 6. And also, it may be so arranged as to readily change the aforesaid warning number of revolutions and critical number of revolutions by means of setting. Numeral 8 is a bar graph decoder for making the driving circuit 6 of the display device l function, and is so arranged as to drive n l pieces of segment 2 by each connecting wire 9 with the exclusion of 1 piece of segment 2, which is driven by signals transmitted by the aforesaid warning revolution decision circuit 5, from n piece segments 2 constructing the display device 1. Accordingly, when output signals corresponding to N number of revolutions are tr nsluitted by the engine revolution operational circuit 4 and are supplied to the bar graph decoder 8, all of the segments 2 excluding the segment 2 corresponding to N revolutions are driven and can show optical changes. Based on the construction mentioned above, description is made on the action of this invention. With the starting of automobile engine, number of revolutions of the engine is supplied in the form of ignition pulse signals to the engine revolution operational circuit 4. In the circuit 4, number of revolutions of the engine are operated, and the output signals corresponding to number of revolutions of the engine thus operated are transmitted to the bar graph decoder 8, the warning revolution decision circuit 5 and the critical revolution decision circuit 7 to make the driving circuit 6 function. As the output signals corresponding to the present number of revolutions of the engine, which act on all necessary number of connecting wires 9, are transmitted by the bar graph decoder 8, if number of revolutions of the engine are smaller in value than the aforesaid warning number of revolution 5,500 rpm , number of revolutions of the engine are shown with the liquid crystal display in the state of the oblique line portion in Fig. 3 a . In case number of revolutions of the engine exceed the aforesaid warning number of revolutions, i.e. 5,500 rpm, the bar graph decoder 8 is not connected with the segments corresponding to said number of revolutions, whereby the segments do not function to come to the state in Fig. 3 b , and other segments 2 function to bring the liquid crystal display. The warning revolution decision circuit 5, in which warning number of revolutions are set to 5,500 rpm, transmits output signals so as to drive segments 2 corresponding to number of revolutions smaller in value than 5,500 rpm through the driving circuit 6 when number of revolutions of engine are smaller in value than 5,500 rpm, so that the circuit S can perform the liquidcrystal display as other oblique line portions of Fig. 3 a by driving only the segments 2 corresponding to said number of revolutions. When number of revolutions of the engine exceed the warning number of revolutions 5,500 rpm , the output signals from the driving circuit 6 acting on said segments 2 are stopped, so that said segments 2 do not work for liquid crystal, and are displayed like the line less portion on Fig. 3 b . When number of revolutions of the engine further increase to reach the critical number of revolutions, i.e. 6,ooh rpm or more, intermittent control signals are transmitted by the critical revolution decision circuit 7 to the driving circuit 6, so that the segments 2 can display the critical state by flickering work as shown in Fig. 3 c d In case number of revolutions of the engine agree with the warning number of revolutions or are smaller in value by the portion corresponding to a piece of segment, there is caused an inconvenience where the display cannot distinguish the present number of revolutions of the engine from the warning number of revolutions.However, there is caused nothing interfering with the practical use if a driver recognizes the fact of reaching the warning revolution area by assuming the case mentioned above in advance. Thus, description was made on one embodiment of this invention, which is not limited to the aforesaid embodiment but can be, of course, practiced with alternation or modification widely in the field of art to which this invention belongs. This invention has an advantage of making a driver enjoy safe driving by preventing reckless driving because, as mentioned above, of displaying number of revolutions of engine on the display device of bar graphic displaying by using segments such as liquid crystal and of making it possible for a driver to constantly compare number of revolutions of engine with warning number of revolutions by setting such number of revolutions and by making the segments corresponding to such warning number of revolutions, and has further advantage of being able to secure more safety because, as mentioned above, of making the bar graphic displaying of the display device flicker to make it possible to give a driver warning when number of revolutions of engine exceed the critical number of revolutions. And also, according to this invention, the display device, which is constructed by bar graphic display, has the effects of good style and easy watch for a driver. l.
