## Description
DESCRIPTION A PROCESS OF ROTATIONAL MOLDING FLUOROPOLYMERS BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention is in the field of rotational molding more particularly, the invention relates to rotationally molded articles and a method to rotationally mold articles having a layer made of a composition containing a fluoropolymer composition. Rotational molding, also known as rotomolding, is used in the manufacture of hollow objects from thermoplastics. In the basic process of rotational molding, solid or liquid polymers are placed in a mold. The mold is first heated and then cooled while being rotated, usually about two perpendicular axes simultaneously.Many polymers can be used in the rotational molding process. Popular polymers for this use are polyolefins such as polyethylene. It is also known to use polycarbonates, crosslinkable polyethylene, nylon, and other materials. In selecting the rotational molding grade formulation, care must be taken to assure that there will not be thermal degradation during the heating cycle. A general discussion on rotational molding is given in MODERN PLASTICS ENCYCLOPEDIA 1979 1980, Volume 56, No. 10A, beginning at Page 381. It is known to rotationally mold fluoropolymers including the copolymer of ethylene and tetrafluoroethylene, the copolymer of ethylene and chlorotrifluoroethylene, and polyvinylidine fluoride. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is a process to rotationally mold a fluoropolymer. The process comprises the step of rotationally molding a fluoropolymer selected from the group comprising polyvinylidene fluoride, and copolymers of 40 to 60 mol percent ethylene with 40 to 60 mol percent of a halogenated comonmer selected from the group consisting of tetrafluoroethylene, chiorotrifluoro ethylene, and mixtures thereof. The fluoropolymer further comprises from 1.5 to 15, preferably from 1.5 to 10, and most preferably from 1.7 to 7 mol percent of hexafluorisobutylene.Preferred terpolymers include the terpolymer comprising 40 to 60 percent ethylene, 40 to 60 mol percent chorchlorotrifluoroethylene, and 1.5 to 15 mol percent hexafluoroisobutylene and the terpolymer comprising 40 to 60 mol percent ethylene, 40 to 60 mol percent tetrafluoroethylene, and 1.5 to 15 mol percent hexafluoroisobutylene. A preferred copolymer is the copolymer of vinylidine fluoride and 1.5 to 15 mol percent hexafluorocoisbbutylene. The fluoropolymer can be formed into particles, such as pellets or powder, suitable for rotational molding. The particles are rotationally molded to form an article. The present invention includes a rotationally molded fluoropolymeric article made according to the process disclosed above. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The present invention is a process of rotationally molding a floropolymer, and an article having a layer of the fluoropolymer. The process of the present invention comprises the steps of rotationally molding a fluoropolymer selected from the group comprising polyvinylidene fluoride, and copolymers of 40 to 60 mol percent ethylene with 40 to 60 mol percent of a halogenated comononer selected from the group consisting of tetrafluoroethylene, chlorotrifluoroethylene, and mixtures thereof. The fluoropolymer further comprises from 1.5 to 15 mol percent of hexafluoroisobutylene. Preferably there is from 1.5 to 10 and more preferably from 1.7 to 7 mol percent of hexafluoroisobutylene. The hexafluoroisobutylene has been found to result in an improved process to rotationally mold and further found to improve the physical properties of rotationally molded articles. More specifically the use of hexafluoroisobutylene reduces the shrinkage and thereby helps to reduce resulting warpage of rotationally molded parts. Physical properties such as impact resistance are improved. It has been found that the hexafluoroisobutylene results in a clear rotationally molded fluoropolymer.This has been illustrated using a 0.32 cm 1 8 inch thick rotationally molded article made of a terpolymer containing equimolar amounts of ethylene and chlorotrifluoroethylene and additionally hexafluoroisobutylene. A 0.32 cm 1 8 inch rotationally molded copolymer of ethylene and chlorotrifluoroethylene is opaque white. The addition of 1.2 mol percent of hexafluorisobutylene results in a translucent article.However, normal size type cannot be read through one side of the article when it is pressed against the opposite side. The addition of about 1.7 mol percent of hexafluoroisobutylene results in an article which is clear or transparent enough to read normal type through one side of the article when a paper containing type is pressed against the opposite side. In the most preferred emodiment of the present invention there is sufficient hexafluoroisobutylene in the polymer to form a rotationally molded transparent article by the present invention. Transparency is measured as the ability to easily read normal size type through one side of the rotationally molded article when the paper containing the type is pressed against the opposite side. Hexafluoroisobutylene, also know as 3,3,3trifluoro 2 trifluoromethyl propene has the formula CF3 2C CH2. It can be made according to the process disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,894,097, hereby incorporated by reference. Other methods to prepare hexafluoroisobutylene are known in the art and include the method described by Kauffman, et al. in J. Org.Chem. 31, 3090 1966 . Briefly, its preparation involves refluxing hexafluoro 2 methyl 2 propanol with phosphorous pentachloride to obtain the desired hexafluoisbutylene as non condensed overhead product, together with concurrently formed hydrogen chloride.The hydrogen chloride can be removed from the crude overhead product by conventional techniques, such as by distillation or by scrubbing with alkaline media. The ethylene, tetrafluoroethylene, chlorotrifluoroethylene, and vinylidene fluoride monomers required for making copolymers useful in the present invention are commercially available. The preferred fluoropolymers useful in the process of the present invention can generally be made by the controlled addition of hexafluoroisobutylene to reactors in which vinylidene fluoride, or in which ethylene and halogenated comomers including chlorotrifluoroethylene, tetrafluoroethylene or mixtures thereof are to be polymerized by methods known in the art. The copolymers of the present invention may be prepared using known polymerization methods, such as, e.g. the method disclosed in Neucleonics, September 1964, pp.72 74, for making high melting 1 1 alternate copolymer of ethylene and chlorotrifluorofluoroethylene using radiation as catalyst at 0 C as shown in British Patent 949,422 by bulk copolymerization of ethylene with halogenated comonomer at temperatures between 80 C to 50 C using oxygen activated alkyl boron catalysts or as shown by Ragazzini et al.ts U.S.P. s 3,371,076 and 3,501,446.They may also be prepared by batchwise bulk copolymerization of the monomers at temperatures of about 0 C, say between 20 to 20 C, at superatomospheric pressure in an agitated pressure vessel, preferably in the presence of inert chlorofluorocarbon sol vent, by charging the vessel with hexafluoroisobutylene and the halogenated monomer and admitting gaseous ethylene into the vessel, using organic peroxide type initiators effective at such temperatures and, if desired, in the presence of small amounts of chain transfer agents such as chloroform or heptane to modify molecular weight. The copolymers of the present invention may also be prepared by polymerization in aqueous suspension or dispersion using known procedures. The amount of the hexafluoroisobutylene contained in the fluoropolymer affects the properties of the fluoropolymer. Typical properties of polyvinylidene fluoride, chlorotrifluoroethylene and tetrafluoroethylene are reviewed in Modern Plastics Encyclopedia,Vol. 56 No. 10A, McGraw Hill, 1979 80 at pp. 30, 504 and 505, hereby incorporated by reference. The addition of hexafluoroisobutylene reduces the polymer melt temperature. Polyvinylidene fluoride has a melt temperature of 156 C ethylene chlorotrifluoroethylene copolymer has a melt temperature of 245 C, and ethylene tetra fluorethylene has a melt temperature of 270 C. The addition of the hexafluoroisobutylene will lower the melt temperature and correspondingly the molding temperature of the process of the present invention. The fluoropolymer can be fed into the mold in powder or pellet form. Pellets can be from about 0.08 x 0.08 cm 1 32 by 1 32 inch or about 0.08 cm 1 32 inch average diameter to about 0.32 x 0.32 cm 1 8 by 1 8 inch or about 0.32 cm 1 8 inch average diameter . A preferred pellet shape is a cylindrical pellet from about 0.08 to 0.16 cm 1 32 to 1 16 inch in diameter, by about 0.16 to 0.32 cm 1 16 to 1 8 inch long. The powder can be as small as 50 mesh with a 35 mesh powder preferred. The composition is formed into particles suitable for rotational molding and is fed into the rotational mold. The composition is heated within the mold as it is rotated. Typically, the mold is indexed into an oven and heated with hot air while the mold rotates. Generally, the rotational mold rotates simultaneously along two perpendicular axes. The mold is heated until the particles within the mold melt and flow together on the inside surface of the mold. The mold is then cooled and the molded article is removed. The fluoropolymer composition can be processed in most commercial rotational molding machines. The oven air temperature should be high enough to melt the fluoropolymer in the rotational mold. Preferably, the fluoropolymer is heated to at least 300C and more preferably 500C above the melting point. For example, for a terpolymer of equimolar amounts of ethylene and chlorotrifluoroethylene a preferred oven temperature is from 5500F 228 C to about 650 0F 343 C and more preferably from 5650F 295 C to about 6250F 329 C . The temperature must be high enough for the particles to fuse together to form a smooth inner surface of the molded article. The mold is heated by suitable means known in the art. Generally, the mold rotates within a forced air circulating oven. After the heating step the mold is cooled. The part must be cool enough to be easily removed from the mold and retain its shape. Preferably, the mold is removed from the oven while continuing to rotate. Cool air is first blown on the mold. The air can be at ambient temperature. Cool air is initially used to prevent the mold from experiencing thermal shock. The initial cool air step prevents part warpage, and premature release of the part from the mold surface which can cause stresses in the part. After the air has started to cool the mold for a controlled time period, a water spray can be used. The water cools the mold more rapidly. The water used can be at cold water tap temperature, usually from 40C 40 F to 160C 60DF . The water step is used to cool the part rapidly.It is believed this reduces the formation of crystals and enhances impact resistance of the part. After the water cooling step, another air cooling step may optionally be used. This is usually a short step during which the equipment dries with heat removed during the evaporation of the water. Typical cooling cycle for the process of the present invention fr rotationally molding fluoropolymers are one to two minutes of forced ambient air cooling followed by three to 10 minutes of water cooling and optionally 1 to 3 minutes of air drying. The heating and cooling cycle times will depend on the equipment used and the article molded. Specific factors include the part thickness and mold material.Typical conditions for a 1 8 inch 0.32 cm thick part made of terpolymer of equimolar amounts of ethylene and chlorotrifluoroethylene with 1.7 to 7 mol percent of hexafluoroisobutylene made in a steel mold are to heat the part in an oven with air at 3290C 625 F for 25 minutes. The part is cooled in ambient temperature forced air for 2 minutes and then in a tap water spray at 100C 50 F for 5 minutes. Optionally, the part is cooled in ambient temperature forced air for an additional 2 minutes. During the heating and cooling steps, the mold containing the molded article is continually rotated along two perpendicular axes. The rate of rotation of the mold about each axis is limited by machine capability and the shape of the article being molded. A typical range of operation which can be used with the present invention is to have a ratio rotation of the major axis to the minor axis of from 1 2 to 1 10, and 2 1 to 10 1. Preferably, the rotational molding is conducted under an inert atmosphere within the mold. However, this is not necessary, although it is preferred. When it is desired to use an inert atmosphere, the mold cavity can be purged with nitrogen. Most rotational molding machines have arms which are drilled for gas injection, so that all that is necessary is to connect a nitrogen gas cylinder to the arm, using the rotary valves in the connection. Alternatively, dry ice can be added to the mold cavity at the time the resin is charged to the mold. The dry ice will sublime during the heating cycle and provide an inert atmosphere The mold surface can be sprayed or coated with a mold release coating. A preferred mold release agent is a baked on silicon based mold release coating, such asFreekote .This coating is baked for 15 20 minutes at 2880C 550 F to 3450C 650 F . The mold is cooled and sanded on the inside. The sanded surface allows the composition too maintain contact during molding and not release too readily and warp while being cooled. Yet upon cooling, the molded article easily releases. A vent can be used to avoid pressure buildup on the inside of the mold during the heating step. The present invention includes rotationally molding fluoropolymer articles. Rotationally molded fluoropolymer articles have been made having wall thickness of from 0.05 to 0.38 cm 0.020 to .150 inches . Molded parts can be stress relieved by heating the part in an oven at 107 to 121 C 225 to 250 F for a short period of time. Several examples are set forth below to illustrate the nature of the invention and the manner of carrying it out. However, the invention should not be considered as being limited to the details thereof. In the following examples a McNeil Akron Model No.500 48 Laboratory Rotational Molding Machine was used.This machine has a 227 Kg 500 lb. capacity and a 122 cm 48 inch swing envelope. The mold rotates simultaneously about 2 perpendicular axes, a major axis and a minor axis. The moldings made were 30.5 cm 12 inch cubes. The mold for the 30.5 cm 12 inch cube was made of cast aluminium. The molds was equipped with a gas inlet port and a vent port. Polymer was charged when the mold was open. In each of the examples the following process was generally followed with specific details and variations noted in the Table. The mold was charged with 2.5 kg 5.5 pounds of 35 mesh powder of the polymer. The vent was open to the atmosphere and plugged loosely with fiberglass to prevent molding powder from escaping. The mold was indexed into the heating oven set at a desired temperature and rotated biaxially for 25 minutes at a rotation ratio of 4 1 and major axis speed of 6 rpm. The rotation ratio is defined as the number of rotations made by the major axis for one rotation of the mold or minor axis . At the end of the first heat cycle the mold was indexed back out to the work area while rotating. The mold was indexed into the cooling station and cooled while being biaxially rotated. EXAMPLES 1 3 In the Examples and Comparatives the fluoropolymer which was rotationally molded had equimolar amounts of ethylene and chlorotrifluoroethylene. The amount of hexafluoroisobutylene HFIB included in the Examples and Comparatives is summarized in the Table below in mol in the terpolymer, and wt based on grams of HFIB fed to the reactor per 100 grams of chlorotrifluoroethylene to form the polymer. The melt index MI measured as gms 10 minutes according to ASTM Test No.1238 run at 2750C under a piston load of 2160 grams, and polymer melting temperature are also indicated in theTable. The heating temperature Molding T F used during the rotational molding, and molded article appearance and clarity are also summarized in theTable. With regard to clarity, Opaque means that little or no light passes through the O.32 cm 1 8 inch thick sample, Translucent means that light can pass through but a sheet of paper containing normal type pressed against one side of the molded article wall cannot be read from the other side and Transparent means that such type can be easily read. The appearance is also noted in the Table. Distortion is an indication of shrinkage.
