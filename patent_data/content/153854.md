## Description
This invention relates to processes for forming pattern films required, for example, in correcting photomasks during the fabrication of semiconductor devices. Masks and reticules for use in the manufacture of semi conductors are made by etching patterns through exposure to light. The process presents problems because of defects the patterns tend to develop. These defects are classified into two groups, unwanted pattern portions left unremoved which are called black spot defects and portions needed but unintentionally etched away, called white spot defects. In JP A 53 135276 there is disclosed a process for forming a pattern film on a substrate comprising maintaining a vapour of an organic compound in contact with the substrate and irradiating a specific portion of the substrate with a beam so as to cause the organic compound to form a pattern film on the specific portion. This enables white spot defects to be repaired. However, the beam disclosed in JP A 53 135276 is an electron beam. As a result, there is considerable electron scattering which makes it difficult to achieve a precise and economical repair. Moreover, the use of an electron beam results in a pattern film which is weakly bonded to the substrate. The kinds of organic compound thus far proposed for use in the known process have included vacuum pump oils, organo metallic compounds such as trimethylaluminium, and bisbenzene complexes such as Cr C₆H₆ ₂ , When vacuum pump oil is used in remedying white spot defects, its low vapour pressure at ordinary temperature 300 K , i.e. below 10 ⁶ Torr, makes the supply of the oil constituent molecules for film forming by polymerisation or carbonisation insufficient. Consequently, the rate of film build up to a desired thickness is low. If the vacuum pump oil were to be heated to raise its vapour pressure for a faster increase in film thickness, it would condense on the sample surface. The condensate would then give incompletely polymerised or carbonised portions along the boundaries between ion beam irradiated and non irradiated areas, bringing difficulties in film formation and other unfavourable effects. The use of organo metallic compounds and bisbenzene complexes also has drawbacks. When the vapour pressure in the vicinity of the sample is low, the build up of the film progresses slowly, and an attempt to raise the pressure for adequately fast film build up will invite difficulties such as scattering of the ion beam out of focus, added load on the vapour discharge system, and adverse effects upon the ion source. Also, the organic compounds containing metallic atoms are often so toxix or unstable that they pose handling problems. The present invention seeks to overcome the difficulties of the conventional processes for forming pattern films by forming a pattern film of less than one micron thickness rapidly by the use of an organic compound with good stability and extremely low toxicity. According to the present invention, there is provided a process for forming a pattern film which comprises irradiating a specific portion of a sample with a beam in an atmosphere where the vapour of an organic compound is present, thereby polymerising or carbonising the organic compound on the specific portion to form a desired pattern film thereon characterised in that said organic compound has a vapour pressure of 300 K between 1 x 10 ⁴ and 5 x 10 ³ Torr, the said vapour being brought into contact with the sample by directing a vapour stream of the organic compound at a specific portion of the sample, the said beam being a focused ion beam. Said organic compound may be a tri or tetracyclic aromatic compound. Preferably said organic compound has a molecular weight between 200 and 400. Said organic compound may consist mainly of a hydrocarbon compound and is free from any metal atom. Said organic compound may be phenanthrene, pyrene, methylphenanthrene, fluoranthene, anthrone or triphenylmethane. The number of organic compound molecules reacted by irradiation with one ion must be between 2 and 7. Average current density of irradiation with an ion beam is between 1 x 10 ³ and 1 x 10 ⁵ A.cm². Thus it is necessary that the organic compound molecules to be polymerised or carbonised are supplied to a support plate at a rate between 1 x 10¹³ and 1 x 10¹⁶ atoms cm² sec. If the organic compound molecules are supplied at a rate of 1 x 10¹³ atoms cm² sec or below, there is too great a volume of irradiation by the low beam. The rate of pattern film build up to the desired thickness is low because of the spattering effect. Thus the pattern film is not formed on the support plate which is spatter etched. On the other hand, if the organic compound molecules are supplied at a rate of 10¹⁶ atoms cm² sec. or above, the adherence of the pattern film on the support plate and its light shielding property are insufficient. The invention is illustrated, merely by way of example, in the accompanying drawings, in which Referring to Figure 1, reference numeral 1 represents a support plate of, for example, glass, reference numeral 2 represents a pattern on the support plate 1 of chromium or other material, and reference numerals 31, 32, 33 are typical white spot defects representing, respectively, an element omission, a disconnection, and a pinhole. These white spot defects, which cause undesired light transmission through the mask, must be removed the light transmitting portions need to be treated to be as light shielding as the rest of the pattern 2. In Figure 2 Figure 3 In Figure 3 In Figure 3 In Figure 3 Now an example of a pattern film formed of pyrene, chosen from among the organic compounds mentioned above, will be described with reference to Figure 4. Figure 4 The physical and chemical adhesion strength of the pattern film obtained in this way are about the same as or more than those of the chromium film, which is well known in the art. The thickness of the pattern film that provides an optical density of 2.8 was approximately 2000 Å for visible light and below 1000 Å for ultraviolet rays. Under the aforedescribed film forming conditions, therefore, it is possible to form a 200 µm long, submicron wide pattern film within 20 seconds by exposure to far ultraviolet rays. The process according to the present invention for forming a film pattern in this way is particularly suited for producing microfine pattern films. It is also possible, of course, to form a larger area of pattern film at a faster rate by irradiation with a focused ion beam of a larger diameter and with a higher probe current. As has been described in detail above, the present invention permits pattern film formation in a single step that concludes within a short period of time and to microfine patterns less than one micron in width. This makes possible a substantial reduction in the number of process stages otherwise required. Further advantages are the ease with which the organic compound is handled and the possibility of designing an apparatus of reasonable, rationalised construction for the purpose of carrying out a process according to the present invention.
