# Dual feed apparatus for a multiple spindle honing machine.

## Abstract
A multiple spindle honing machine includes automatically controlled feed cylinders 66a 66h for initially expanding honing tools driven by the spindles 40a 40h and also includes a constant rate feed mechanism 70 that continues to expand the tools after the initial tool expansion actuated by the feed cylinders 66a 66h . Each spindle 40a 40h includes a connector 68 that extends between one of the feed cylinders 66a 66h and its associated honing tool. Mechanical locks 178a 178h respectively lock the feed cylinders 66a 66h after the initial tool expansion. The constant rate feed mechanism 70 continues tool expansion after the feed cylinders 66a 66h are locked. Electrical and hydraulic circuits control operation of the pressure feed cylinders 66a 66h , the constant rate feed mechanism 70 , and the mechanical locks 178a 178h . Each honing tool is automatically contracted independently of the other tools after the respective bore being machined reaches the required size and, after all the tools are contracted, the feed cylinders 66a 66h may be actuated to re expand the tools for a finishing operation.
