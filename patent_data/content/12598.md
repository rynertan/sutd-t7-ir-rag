# Throttle linkage.

## Abstract
A throttle linkage for a carburetor having a primary and secondary induction passages 12, 14 with a primary and sec ondary throttle valve 17, 19 pivotably mounted respectively in these passages comprises with a mechanical linkage 66, 70, 72 between the primary and secondary throttle valve for opening the secondary throttle valve after the primary throt tle valve has opened by a predetermined amount. A spring 78 is mounted normally to close the secondary throttle valve when the primary throttle valve is moved to a closed position, but the mechanical linkage is constructed to close the sec ondary throttle valve when the primary throttle valve is moved toward a closed position if the spring should fail to close the secondary throttle valve.
