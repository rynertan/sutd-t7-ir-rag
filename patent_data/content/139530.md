## Description
PREPARATION OF LIGNOCELLULOSIC COMPOSITE ARTICLESFIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to the compression molding of lignocellulosic materials into composite bodies, sheets and the like, and more particularly to an improved method for the preparation of particle board with an organic di or polyisocyanate based binder system wherein a mineral acid is employed directly on the lignocellulosic material or incorporated into the di or polyisocyanate to provide a molded product with superior dimensional stability at low use levels of isocyanate application.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The molding of lignocellulosic and lignocellulosiccontaining fibers, particles or layers to form composite articles is known. The binders which normally are used are the synthetic resin glues such as a solution of ureaformaldehyde resin or phenol formaldehyde resin in waterComposite products containing ligno cellulose produced in this manner lack durability and are susceptible to moisture conditions and deterioration in certain huilding purposes to which they may be subjected. Di and polyisocyanates as binders for lignocellulose materials have been known for some time and give to particle board products an increased stability and mechanical strength see, for example United States PatentNo. 3,428,592 3,440,189 3,557,263 3,636,199 3,870,665 3,919,017 and 3,930,110. It is also known in the art that the isocyanate binders are mixed with the wood particles utilized as the base for the particle board. A wood chip or particle and isocyanate binder mixture is then formed into a mat and molded with pressure and temperature to the desired size or shape. Water emulsion polyisocyanate binder systems for use with lignocellulosic particles are also known.Because the di and polyisocyanates are much more expensive to use than the phenol or urea formaldehyde binders for particle board, the isocyanates must be employed in lesser amounts in order to be competitive. A principal disadvantage of using low levels of the isocyanates is the production of particle board with undesirable thickness swelling and linear expansion properties. In commercial particle board production whether with a phenol or urea formaldehyde binder or an isocyanate binder, a certain amount of waxes are added to aid in retarding water uptake and thickness swelling.Such treatment, however, is only effective for short periods of time. When soaking is prolonged or the board is in contact with hot water, wax treatment to reduce thickness swelling and water uptake is no longer effective. The present invention which relates to an improved process for the preparation of lignocellulosic composite articles, especially particle board, employing an isocyanate based binder system, comprises contacting the lignocellulosic particles with a mineral acid. The contacting may be by spraying prior to addition of the binder or the mineral acid may be added along with the isocyanate binder. Such method overcomes the abovementioned disadvantages and produces a particle board with exceptionally high dimensional stability at low levels of isocyanate application. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates two the preparation of lignocellulosic composite articles or sheets having superior dimensional stability and strength which comprises shaping in a mold or between mold surfaces a mixture of lignocellulosic particles and a polyisocyanate based binding agent, the lignocellulosic particles having been contacted with a mineral acid, such as nitric acid, either directly or along with the polyisocyanate based binder. It is an object of this invention to provide an improved method for the preparation of lignocellulosic composite articles. It is a further object to provide an improved particle board having excellent stability and strength characteristics. An advantage of the present invention is that levels of the di or polyisocyanate necessary to produce a cured pressed composite lignocellulosic product can be reduced while maintaining equivalent or superior composite board physical properties. The instant method reduces thickness swelling and linear expansion of particle or flake board without affecting other properties. The boards are stabilized even under severe conditions such as prolonged soaking or in hot water. Further the addition of the inorganic mineral acid aids in providing a more complete emulsification of emulsifiable polyisocyanates when applied to the lignocellulosic particles in that manner. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention comprises an improved method for the preparation of lignocellulosic composite molded articles, particularly particle board, by bonding together wood chips or other lignocellulosic or organic material using heat and pressure with an organic polyisocyanate employed as the binding agent, the improvement being the incorporation of a mineral acid with the lignocellulose particles either directly, as by spraying the particles or in an admixture with the polyisocyanate binder when applied to the lignocellulosic particles prior to shaping into the desired form.The lignocellulosic material and the isocyanate based binder along with the added mineral acid of the present invention is shaped or formed into a composite body at temperatures of from about 1400C. to 220 C., preferably 1600C. to 1900C. and at pressures of from about 100 to 600 psi for a period of from 1 to 10 preferably 3 to 5 minutes. The isocyanate binding agent will generally be an organic polyisocyanate used alone but may also be in an admixture with another type of binding agent, e.g. a synthetic resin glue, or with other materials such as alkylene carbonates, epoxides as well as lignin as described for example in U. S. Patent No. 4,359,507. The polyisocyanate component which is us ed in the present invention in the binder system can be any organic polyisocyanate and include aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic polyisocyana tes that contain at least two isocyanate groups per molecule. Such polyisocyanates include the diisocyanates and higher functionality isocyanates. Mixtures of polyisocyanates may be used which for example are the mixtures of di and higher functional polyisocyanates produced by phosgenation of aniline formaldehyde condensate or as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,962,302 and 3,919,279.The organic polyisocyanates may be isocyanate ended prepolymers made by reacting under standard known conditons, an excess of a polyisocyanate with a polyol which on a polyisocyanate to polyol basis may range from about 20 1 to 2 1 and include for example polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, triethylene glycol, etc., as well as glycols or polyglycols partially esterified with carboxylic acids including polyester polyols and polyether polyols.Illustrative of organic polyisocyanates which may be employed are for example, toluene 2,4 and 2,6 diisocyanates or mixtures thereof, diphenylmethane diisocyanate, m and p phenylene diisocyanates or mixtures thereof, mand p diphenylene diisocyanates, polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanates, naphthalene l, 5 diisocyanate, chlorophenylene diisocyanate,cx,çC xylene diisocyanate, triphenylmethane triisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, 3,3 ditolylene 4,4 diisocyanate, butylene 1,4 diisocyanate, octylene l, 8 diisocyanate, 1,4 , 1,3 and 1,2 cyclohexylene diisocyanate and in general the polyisocyanates disclosed inU.S. Patent No. 3,577,358, 3,012,008 and 3,097,191. The preferred polyisocyanates are the diphenylmethane diisocyanate 2,4 and 4,4 isomers including the 2,2 isomer and the higher functional polyisocyanate and polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanate mixtures , which may contain from about 20 to 85 weight percent of the diphenylmethane diisocyanate isomers. Typical of the preferred polyisocyanates are those sold commercially as ZRubinate Mt Rubicon Chemicals, Inc. . In general the organic polyisocyanates will have a molecular weight in the range between about 100 and 10,000. The aqueous organic polyisocyanate or isocyanate terminated prepolymer emulsions are generally prepared by using any of the techniques known in the art for the preparation of aqueous emulsions or dispersions prior to use of the composition as binder.In general the polyisocyanate is dispersed in water in the presence of an emulsifying or surface active agent which may be any of the emulsifying agents also known in the art including anionic and nonionic agents.Preparation of the aqueous emulsions may be carried out as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,996,154, 4,143,014 and 4,257,995. Lignocellulose, according to the present invention used to prepare the lignocellulosic containing composite articles include wood chips, wood fibers, shavings, sawdust, wood wool, cork, bark and the like products for the wood working industry. Fibers, particles, etc. from other natural products which are lignocellulosic such as straw, flax residues, dried weeds and grasses, nut shells, hulls from cereal crops such as rice and oats and the like may be used. In addition, the lignocellulosic materials may be mixed with inorganic flakes or fibrous material such as glass fibers or wool, mica and asbestos as well as with rubber and plastic materials in particulate form. The lignocellulose may contain a moisture water content of up to about 25 percent by weight but preferably contains between 4 and 12 percent by weight. The inorganic mineral acids which may be employed in the process of the invention in amounts of from about 0.1 to 5.0 preferably from 0.25 to 1.5 percent based on the weight of oven dried 08 moisture content lignocellulosir material, are phosphoric, nitric, hydrochloric and sulfuric and may have concentrations of between 0.1 to 98 percent and preferably are employed in concentrations of between 5 and 30 percent. In manufacturing lignocellulosic composite products for the purpose of this invention, such as particle or flake board for example, a small amount of binder with or without lignin etc. along with the lignocellulosic material is simply milled or mixed uniformly together. Generally, the isocyanate binding agent which may also contain the mineral acid if the acid has not been applied directly to the lignocellulosic material, is sprayed onto the lignocellulose while it is being mixed or agitated in suitable and conventional equipment. Various type mixing equipment such as an intensive shear mixer may be employed. The binder use level according to the present invention, based on the weight of oven dried 08 moisture content lignocellulosic material is from about 1.5 to 12 preferably 2.5 to 6.5 weight percent.The lignocellulose adhesive binder mixture is generally sprinkled or formed in the desired proportions onto a caul plate of aluminium or steel which serves to carry the flakes into the press to give the desired thickness of product, the plates usually having been sprayed or coated with a release agent such as the metal soaps, phenolates or certain tertiary amines and the like.
