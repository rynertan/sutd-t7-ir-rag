# Gradient index lens array.

## Abstract
A gradient index lens array 20 is provided with reduc tion and enlargement capabilities. Gradient index fibers 30a 30g are arranged in single row or double row bundled configuration with fibers increasingly departing from the per pendicular condition at the centre 41 of the array relative to object and image planes 22,32 in a characteristic fan like manner. Fiber lengths are adjusted to compensate for changes in total conjugate which occur because of the prog ressive tilting of the axes of the individual fiber lenses. This is achieved, in one embodiment, by grinding the faces 42,43 of a lens array into a convex configuration.
