# Heat activatable multi component sheet material and process for making same.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a heat activatable adhesive formed from at least two components each in the form of discrete, flowable particles which are capable of adhering in abutment of one particle with another to provide an open structured, porous matrix. The adhesive may be in the form of a sheet formed by blending the particles of each component, applying the mechanical mixture to a support ing sheet heating the mixture and supporting sheet to the temperature at which the material with the lowest tackifying temperature becomes tacky applying pressure sufficient to partially flatten the largest particles to a degree such that their minimum dimension is substantially equivalent to the thickness of the layer formed on said support sheet and during or after said pressure application.
