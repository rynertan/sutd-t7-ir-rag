# AN APPARATUS FOR ABRADING MACHINING OF THE WELDING ZONE FOR THE RIMS OF BICYCLE AND MOTOR VEHICLE WHEELS

## Abstract
A snap rotary table carries thereon rims for abrading machining at the welding zone, which are subsequently moved to positions where the abrading tools, such as grind ing wheel and abrasive bands, are operative. The rim supporting means comprise two cantilever fac ing spaced apart lower bearings and an upper clamping device. Thus, the zone to be machined is exposed on all sides and the abrading tools located at the various operative posi tions are allowed to machine the entire zone.
