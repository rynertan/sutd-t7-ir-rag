# Reactive snubber for inductive load clamp diodes.

## Abstract
A saturable reactor snubber 14 to improve the recovery characteristics of a clamp diode 13 used in a power switching circuit is provided with a secondary winding 14a to permit saturating the reactor via a secondary current pulse in order to improve the turn on speed of the clamp diode. The current pulse for saturating the reactor at turn on is preferably derived from a shunt snubber charging pulse or from an external generator synchronized to the turn off time of a power switching device in the switching circuit.
