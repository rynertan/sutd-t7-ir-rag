# Improvements to sports rackets.

## Abstract
A sports racket having a head including a first frame within which is strung plural string elements interconnected to form a ball engaging surface on each face of the racket, further comprises a second frame formed with a hand grip and first and second frame arms projecting outward there from. Each first and second frame arm has two welded points of connection with the first frame located respectively at up per and lower portions of the racket head. Upon impact of a ball with the string surface, impact force is transmitted to the second frame through the points of connection, permitting the racket head to flex between the points of connection so that the string surface remains generally parallel to the hand grip for improved controllability of the ball.
