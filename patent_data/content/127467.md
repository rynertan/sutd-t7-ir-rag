# SELF INCOMPATIBILITY GLYCOPROTEIN

## Description
This invention relates to the identification and isolation in substantially pure form of an antigenic protein material from mature styles of self incompatible plants, particularly members of the Solanaceae and the Cruciferae, as exemplified by Accordingly, this material has potential for use in control of pollen tube growth, for example, as a natural gametocide to control, induce, or promote self incompatibility and interspecific incompatibility. The Many plant species, including In plants exhibiting self incompatibility, where the same For general reviews of self incompatibility, see de Nettancourt 1977 , There are five species of gametophytically self incompatible plants and two species of sporophytically incompatible plants in which differences in style or stigma proteins apparently related to A glycoprotein corresponding to genotypes Peroxidase isoenzymes extracted from styles of In the present work, style extracts from the heterozygous self incompatible gentoypes As a result of this work, glycoprotein materials have been identified in the 30,000 MW region of stylar extracts of all genotypes The term In the discussions of antibodies and antisera which follow hereinafter, unless otherwise specifically designated, the terms antibody and antiserum include both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies and antisera. Closely related, but distinct, glycoprotein materials are identified in SDS PAGE gels which correspond to individual genotypes studied. For each genotype, the genotype specific glycoprotein only appears as the flower matures, and is detected only in style extracts of buds at first show of petal color and in later stages of maturation, but not in the earlier bud stages. Two dimensional gels confirm the genotype specificity of these glycoproteins and indicate that they are characteristically of high isoelectric point, with the exception of Further details of these antigenic glycoprotein materials, and of their isolation and identification, are given in the following detailed description. In the accompanying drawings Referring firstly to Figures 1 and 2, there is shown in Figure 1 the normal growth of pollen tubes in an illustrative compatible pollination between, for example The plant materials used in the present work were based on Buds generated from The bud pollinated plants were kept in the Phytotron at 20 C and constant humidity and were labelled with key tags placed on the floral axis. After six weeks the mature, dry seed pods were harvested. The genotype of the F₁ progeny was established by test crossing against testers of known self incompatibility genotype. The general methods used in the isolation and identification of the antigenic glycoprotein materials are as follows Electrophoresis was at 25mA per gel for the stacking gel and 40mA per gel for the running gel. After electrophoresis the gels were either stained with 0.14 w v Coomassie Blue in 45 v v methanol, 9 v v acetic acid or were transferred to nitrocellulose paper. Style extracts of Extract 15µl containing approximately 15µg protein was applied to an LKB Ampholine PAG plate, LKB Produkter AB, Bromma, Sweden 24cm wide, 10cm long containing ampholine pH3.5 9.5 . Isoelectric focussing was performed according to the Manufacturer s instructions with the following modifications constant power 15 watts at 10 C for 3.5 hours with 9cm between the electrodes. Electrode solutions were 1M NaOH cathode and 1M H₃PO₄ anode . The gel was fixed with 10 TCA and 35 sulphosalicyclic acid for 30 minutes prior to staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The protein track approximately 0.5cm or in some instances, proteins from a selected narrow pI range, from the isoelectric focussing gel was cut out and placed in 200ml of distilled water for 10 minutes, then transferred to 10ml of 1M Tris HCl pH6.8 for 5 minutes. The gel strips were further rinsed with distilled water for 10 minutes before being equilibrated with SDS sample buffer for 1.5 hours at room temperature and placed on the top of an SDS polyacrylamide gel as shown in Fig. 5. The second dimensional gel electrophoresis was carried out according to Laemmli Protein A 40µg was labelled with ¹²⁵I 0.3mCi using the Iodogen method specific activity 1 x 10⁴ to 1 x 10⁵ cpm per µg Protein A . ¹²⁵I Protein A 20µg was diluted to 200ml in 3 BSA in Tris saline and incubated with the nitrocellulose paper for 0.5 hours with gentle agitation at 20 C. The nitrocellulose paper was washed in Tris saline, then 0.05 NP 40 in Tris saline for 10 minutes each at 20 C. The final wash was in Tris saline containing 0.5 Triton X 100 Trademark, Rohm and Haas Corp., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , 0.1 SDS, 0.25 gelatine and 5mM EDTA for 1 hour at 20 C with gentle agitation. The paper was sealed in a plastic bag and exposed to Kodak XAR 5 x ray film Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY , for 6 16 hours at 70 C. Flowers from Prior to ion exchange chromatography the style extract 11ml was equilibrated with NH₄HCO₃ 5mM pH 8.6, NaCl 1mM, CaCl₂, 1mM, EDTA 1mM by passage through a Sephadex G 25 Trademark, Pharmacia Inc., Uppsala, Sweden column 1.6cm diameter 22cm long, void volume 11ml . The first 16ml eluted after the void volume was collected and applied to DEAE Sepharose Trademark, Pharmacia Inc., Uppsala, Sweden Bed volume 26ml, 1.6cm diameter x 13cm long which was equilibrated with the same ammonium bicarbonate buffer. The column was then washed with this buffer 50ml before the application of a NaCl gradient 0 0.5M . The elution profile is shown in Figure 7. Elution was monitored by A₂₈₀. Each fraction was examined by SDS PAGE for the presence of the 32K The unbound fraction from DEAE Sepharose 8ml was applied to a column of Biogel P150 void volume 14ml 1.6cm in diameter, 36.5cm long which was equilibrated with NH₄HCO₃ 10mM, pH 8.5, EDTA 10mM, NaCl 0.1M, CaCl₂ 1mM. The elution profile is shown in Figure 8. Fractions were examined for the presence of the 32K ConA Sepharose was washed with 5 volumes of methyl α D mannoside 0.1M in buffer sodium acetate 20mM, pH 7.8 NaCl 0.1M, MgCl₂ 1mM, CaCl₂ 1mM, MnCl₂ 1mM . The washed ConA Sepharose was then transferred to bicarbonate buffer 0.25M NaHCO₃ pH 8.8 for 1 hour at room temperature the bicarbonate buffer was changed 4 times during the 1 hour period. Four volumes of NaHCO₃ 0.25M, pH 8.8 containing 0.03 v v glutaraldehyde were added and the ConA Sepharose was then washed with NaHCO₃ 0.1M, pH 8.0, containing 0.5M NaCl, resuspended in acetate buffer sodium acetate 10mM, pH 7.8 NaCl 0.1M, MgCl₂ 1mM CaCl₂ 1mM, MnCl₂ 1mM and packed into a column 0.8cm diameter, 14cm long . The unbound fraction from DEAE Sepharose was equilibrated in acetate buffer, by passing through a G25 Sephadex column equilibrated with acetate buffer, then applied to the column. Unbound material was collected, the column washed with 10 volumes of acetate buffer, and the bound material eluted with 0.1M methyl α D mannoside in acetate buffer. The profile is shown in Figure 9. Fractions 34 38 were collected and concentrated to 1ml by rotary evaporation. The pooled fraction eluted by 0.1M methyl α D mannoside was applied to a column of Biogel P150 to separate the methyl α D mannoside from the The purified The molecular weights of the Distinct proteins were similarly observed in style extracts of Extracts of The 32K glycoprotein is present in the stigma and in the upper style sections in higher concentrations than in the lower sections of the style, as revealed by SDS PAGE of extracts of 5mm style sections. The highest concentration of the 32K glycoprotein was found in the upper part of the style, which is also the zone in which pollen tube inhibition occurs. Similarly, in No bands corresponding to the Biological activity of 32K While the foregoing experiments have been carried out in greatest detail using the An antiserum was raised in rabbits against the Using essentially the same technique, a variety of antisera were shown to immuno precipitate ¹²⁵I labeled In Fig. 13, the results of immunoprecipitation analysis using antiserum raised to Antiserum to both The fact of immunological cross reactivity between The availability of New interspecific hybrids can be created by techniques that exploit The foregoing strategy can be extended to produce hybrid seed.
