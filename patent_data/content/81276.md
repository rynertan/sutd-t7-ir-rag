## Description
IDENTIklAT It has previously been determined that a reliable method of checking the identification of an individual is to measure the dimensions of a human hand and particularly the lengths of the various fingers. For instance, when it is desired to know whether an individual who presents a credit card is the proper holder of the credit card, one can compare the lengths of the fingers with stored data to determine with a high degree of accuracy whether the person presenting the card is the one to whom the card was issued. The advantages of such identification systems are fully set forth in U.S. patents 3,576,538 and 3 648,240 both of which relate to identification systems based on the lengths of fingers. The former patent employed mechanical probes to determine finger lengths and it was found that this was objectionable by many people. The second patent was an improvement thereon in that one merely held his hand over a flat surface having a plurality of light pick up means imbedded within the surface a light was placed over the identification plate so that one could scan The light pick up points and determine the finger lengths. This apparatus had the disadvantage of being affected by the length of the fingernails. Thus, when fingernails grew or were cut, an authorized person s identity would fail to be veri fied by the machine. Also, the only biometric information sensed by the previous inventions was the location of the fingertips and webbing between fingers. With this limited amount of information, false accept and false reject error rates were on the order of 22 5 . Also, because of the methods of the previous inventions, it was relatively simple to produce an artificial hand from a simple cardboard cutout. This made the previous inventions unsuitable for use in high security areas. In accordance with the present invention, an improved apparatus of the finger or hand identification type is provided wherein the entire apparatus is included within a member on which a hand can be placed.In accordance with a preferred embodiment, a flat plate which occupies little counter space and which has a relatively low power consumption is employed. Further, all significant optical features along the length of the finger and the webbing between fingers can be measured and some or all used in the determination of valid identity. Also because of the optical geometry of the measuring device, the measurement is free from artifact due to fingernails. Likewise, the system is very difficult to defeat with an artificial hand since to dosb would require the adequate replication of the many features which are measured. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an identification apparatus of the type wherein one determines the characteristics of one or more fingers which does not require an overhead light source and which measures a plurality of characteristics of the hand or fingers. Other objects and features of the invention will be brought out in the balance of the specification. In order that the present invention may more readily be understood the following description is given, merely by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 is a perspective view of an apparatus embodying the present invention.

Fig. 13 is still another scan curve. Fig. 14 is another scan curve. Fig. 15 is a first derivative curve, i.e. dV of dt the curve of Fig. 14. Fig. 16 is a second derivative d2v of the same atL curve. Referring now to the drawings by reference characters, there is shown an identification system which includes a hand plate 10 mounted on a base 12. A card reader 14 is connected by a suitable cable 16 to the identification device. The hand plate 10 has a plurality of slots therein and, in the embodiment illustrated, has slots for four fingers designated 18, 20, 22 and 24 which are splayed as in a normal hand. In addition, two slots are provided designated 26 and 28, the purpose of which is to identify the crotch positions between the fingers placed between slots on 18 and 20 as well as between slots 22 and 24, respectively. The hand plate also has a locating pin 30 to insure that one places the hand in the proper position on the identification device. Normally, the hand plate is hollowed around each of the finger slots as is shown at 32 ordinarily the crotch slots are not so hollowed. This hollowing of the finger slots makes it simpler to place the hand in the proper position and also secures better contact between the finger and the hand plate. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, both the light source and the light sensing device are incorporated in a cell located under the hand plate 10. The cells move up and down on the finger slots and the crotch slots to measure the desired characteristics of the fingers. One of the cells is shown enlarged in Fig. 7. The cell is generally designated 34 and has a round body portion 36 with opposed flat sides 38. The flat sides 38 form a sliding fit in one of the longitudinal slots. The cell also has flat sides 39 at right angles to the flat sides 38 which fit into a transverse slot as at 20B in figures 6 and 7.Each of the cells contains a light source such as a LED 40 and a photoelectric pick up cell 42. Thus each of the units 34 is self contained with its light source and pick up so that if there is light colored object, such as a finger in the slot, light will be reflected back from the light source to the pick up cell 42. As can best be seen in Fig. 3, the path of travel of the cells 34 is up and down the path of the extended fingers. Since the fingers are spread out in a normal hand it is necessary that the path of the cells have both a longitudinal and a transverse component. The method of achieving the combination of the longitudinal and the transverse travel will now be described. Mounted under the hand plate 10 is a longitudinal guide plate 44 which has a plurality of slots therein corresponding to the slots in the hand plate.Thus slot 18A in the longitudinal guide plate corresponds to slot 18 in the hand plate and so on. Mounted under the longitudinal guide plate is the movable transverse guide plate 46 which is mounted for longitudinal movement on the rods 48 and 50. This plate has a series of short slots corresponding with the slots in the longitudinal guide plate except that these slots are at right angles to the slots in the longitudinal guide plate. Thus, slot 18B is lo cated at a right angle to slot 18A and so on In addition, plate 46 has a transverse slot 52 extending for almost the complete width of the plate. .Mounted under the transverse drive plate 46 is a motor 54 with a gear box 56 mounted thereon with an output shaft 58. Shaft 58 is coupled to a crank arm 60 provided with a roller 62 which fits into slot 52. The motion imparted can best be appreciated with reference to Fjgts. 3 and 5. As shaft 58 revolves, the drive plate 46 moves up and down on rods 48 and 50 in the direction shown by the double arrow 64. This will cause cells 34 to move in a transverse direction and at the same time in a longitudinal direction the interaction of the two sets of slots produces a vector upon each of the cells so that as the shaft 58 makes one revolution, each of the cells will follow an angling path up and down one of the finger slots. It is preferred that the device work on infrared light to reduce the effect of ambient light on the operation. Accordingly, the strips 66 which are transparent to infrared light and opaque to visible light would normally be placed under each of the slots of the hand plate 10. The drive plate 46 also carries a transparent grid blade 68 which has a series of dark lines 70 Thereon.The grid plate 68 passes between the arms 71 and 72 of an optical sensor which can be of substantially The same structure as the device 34 so that as the grid 68 passes over the pick up 72, a series of pulses will be produced to serve as a clock to indicate the position of the drive plate. Optically significant features are determined by a measurement of optical reflectance along the finger.Such features include the position of maximum reflectance points, minimum reflectance points, and points half way in reflectance between maximum and minimum points. The position of the maximum, minimum and midpoints of the spacial 1st, 2nd, 3rd Nth derivatives of the reflectance signal can serve as reference points. Since fingers differ in albedo it is preferable not to look for some absolute value of reflectivity but it is better to employ a circuit which has a floating reference point and which adjusts for differences in the reflectivity of fingers. Strangely enough, it has been found that the refectivity reaches a peak near the tip of the finger where the tip of the finger is not in contact with the plate. Advantage is taken of this in one practical embodiment of the invention and the cut off point is the 50 fall off in light pick up after the circuit reaches a peak value. This is illustrated inFig. 9 where the sensor 34 is shown moving along a finger 75. The amount of light pick up is shown on the curve below. It will be seen that there as the sensor moves along the finger, various peaks in reflectivity such as those designated 77A, 77B and 77C are noted.Just as the pick up reaches a point just short of the fingertip a peak 79 is reached. Now as the sensor moves farther out, the light pick up gradually falls off and the half value point 81 can be employed as a trigger.Similarly, the position of the crotch can be measured, and in one embodiment of the invention, identification is made based solely on the length of the fingers as determined by the position of the tip and crotch. How ever, in other embodiments, other features such as the points 77A C can be measured and compared with stored data as is described later. Figs. 11, 12, 13 and 14 show scans of typical fingers. It will be seen that the maximum value of reflected light does not reach a sharp peak so that the maximum value is not a suitable reference point. However by measuring the minimum reflectance point as well as the maximum and taking a value half way between these points, one obtains a valid and reproducible reference point. Another method of securing significant measurements is illustrated in Figs. 14, 15 and 16. In Fig. 15 the first derivative dV of the curve of Fig. 14 is plot dt ted so that one obtains a plurality of peaks such as those designated 43A, 43B and 43C which can be compared with stored data. One can now take the second derivative m of this curve, as is shown in Fig. 16, and dot2 obtain a series of flip flops from a positive to a negative value at The cross over points 45A, 45B...45X which are easy to detect. Higher derivations provide even more sharply defined points. Thus, by taking the first, second or higher derivatives of the response curves, one can convert subtle, almost imperceptible changes into sharply defined points. In Fig. 8 there is shown a highly simplified diagram of the detection system and it will be seen that the light falling on the sensors 42A, 42B, 42C, 42D, 42E and 42F representing four fingers and two crotches of a hand is fed to an analog signal multiplexer 83 whose inputs are connected to each of the photo detector circuits this signal is fed to an analog to digital converter 84 connected to the output of the analog multiplexer, and then to a microprocessor 85 which controls the multiplexer and receives the output of the analog to digital converter. A grid clock 87 develops a position signal which is fed to the microprocessor 85.A magnetic card reader 14 which is connected to the microprocessor stores and provides the reference hand geometry data. In this manner, one or more characteristics such as the length of the finger are determined and is compared with data included on the card, or supplied from a separate source. Normally it is preferred that the light source and photosensor be mounted as a unit in a cell which scans a portion of the hand. However, it is also possible to use a fixed light source as is shown in Fig. 10. Here a fixed light source 95 is employed which illuminates the end and a portion of the under surface of a finger and the moving cell 97 contains only the photosensor. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that many variations can be made in the exact structure shown without departing from the spirit of this invention. For instance, instead of the flat plate illustrated, the sensor could be enclosed in a cylindrical or round object which the subject would grasp.
