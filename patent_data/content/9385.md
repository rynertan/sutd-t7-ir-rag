# Process for methanol production.

## Abstract
An improved methanol synthesis process is provided wherein synthesis gas containing hydrogen and carbon dioxide is passed over a methanol synthesis catalyst, cooled to condense methanol and water in the reacted gas, the liquids separated, a purge gas stream removed while the remaining reacted gas is recycled to the synthesis catalyst, the purge gas separated by contacting the outer surfaces of a plurality of hollow fiber membranes selectively perme able to hydrogen and carbon dioxide to form a permeant gas depleted in hydrogen and carbon dioxide and a perme ate gas enriched in said gases and the enriched permeate gas is combined with the synthesis gas. In an optional em bodiment, methanol vapor is first recovered from the purge gas prior to contacting the selectively permeable mem branes, preferably by a water scrub.
