The present invention accomplishes its desired objects by broadly providing a beverage composition and a beverage concentrate for consumption by a mammalian body to replace the body fluids and essential electrolytes which have been depleted. The beverage composition and concentrate comprises a chelate selected from the group consisting of potassium aspartate, magnesium aspartate, potassium orotate, magnesium orotate, and mixtures thereof, and a sweetener agent selected from the group consisting of fructose, aspartame, and mixtures thereof. The beverage composition and beverage concentrate each,additionally pre ferabiy comprise a tartness agent. a smoothness agent, a flavoring agent, and a pH adjusting agent.The present invention also accomplishes its desired objects by broadly providing a method for preparing or making the beverage composition and the beverage concentrate by adding the ingredients to an aqueous solution and heating the solu cion. The heated solution is subsequently packaged and cooled. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide beverage compositions which are to be consumed by persons needing body fluids and essential electrolytes. It is another objects of this invention to provide beverage conpentrates which are to be admixed with water to provide the beverage compositions. It is yet another object of this invention to provide a method for preparing the beverage compositions and the beverage concentrates. These together with the various ancillary objects and features which will become apparent to those skilled int the art as the following description proceeds, are attained by the beverage compositions and beverage concentrations, and method for preparing or making the beverage compositions and concentrqtions of this invention. This invention includes a beverage for consumption by mamnalian bodies, preferably humans, to replace the body fluids and essential electrolytes which have been depleted, such as during exercise. The beverage comprises an aqueous solution containing per 250 nix. 1 15 meq. of a chelate selected from the group consisting of potassium aspartate, magnesium aspartate, potassium orotate, magnesium orotate, and mixtures thereof and 3 12 g. of s sweetener agent selected from the group con waisting of fructose, aspartame, and mixtures thereof. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the beverage preferably additionally includes per 250 ml. of aqueous solution, between about 0.05 g. to about 0.6 g. of a tartness agent and between about 0.01 g. and about 0.04 g. OF e pH adjusting agent in order to adjust the pH of the beverage to between about 3.8 and about 4.2. The beverage compositions of this invention also preferably additionally include between about 0.2 g. and about 0.6 g. of a smoothness agent per 250 ml. of the aqueous solution, and between about 0.2 ml. and about 0.45 ml. of a flavoring agent per 250 nil, of the aqueous solution. The beverage compositions of this invention may be consumed by persons engaged in vigorous activity, such as athletes. It may also be confumed by people doing strenous work, especially in hot environments or by people who have suffered the loss of body fluids and electrolytes as a result of some illness of disease. The beverage composition of this invention may also supplement normal dietetic requirements for an energy source. The replacement of body fluids and electrolytes lost by those individuals engaged in strenous activities is essential if smooth and efficient muscle function is to be msintaJnrd. Because of the constant 1066 of potassium by muscles in order to dilate the blood vessels to keep the muscles cool and the equal loss of magnesium through perspiration, those individuals undergoing work, exercise, or any activity requiring the strenous use of the muscles, need rapid replacement of the body fluids and electrolytes lost through perspiration and breathing.Should the body fluid and or electrolyte loss be large and or go uncompensated, then sever injury. or even death, can occur to certain individuals. The beverage compositions of this invention provide an all natural tomposition for the rapid replacement of essential body fluids and or electrolytes in those individuals needing such replacements. The beverage compositions do not contain high amounts of sodium, glucose, dex trose, sucrose or synthetic sweeteners, artificial coloring and flavoring, preservatives, or other non essential elements which inhibit the absorption of fluids and or may even cause nausea. An important active constituent s in the beverage compositions of this invention are the chelating agent s . I have discovered that the active chelates chosen should preferably be of natural origin, non toxic, non irritating to the buccal cavity, alimentary canal, gastric mucoba, or the intestinal tract. The chelates should preferably also be tightly bound, easily absorbed and transferred to the muscle cells, must not interfere with the absorption of water by the intestines, and must be present in low concentrations so as not to promote further dehydration due to osmosis. When absorbed. the chelates of this invention must assist in removal of heat away from active muscle s , as well as promote good muscle tone and smooth muscle action. An a preferred embodiment of this invcntion. the cht ates of the beverage composition of this invention are the chelates of aspartate and orotate chelates of potassium and magnesium. I have discovered that these particular chelates are non toxic, tightly bound, nonirritating to the buccal cavity, alimentary canal, gastric muscosa or intestinal tract. I have also discovered that these particular chelates do not impede the absorption of water from the intestinal tract because of the fact that their ionic charge is opposite to that of the gascric mucosa or intestinal wall. These particular chelates are easily abSorbed and dre quickly transferred to the tissues whereupon they enter ihe cells to replace potassium and magnesium which may have been depleted.These chelate substances are physiologically compatible with the systems of both humans and animals. The chelates of aspartate and orotate chelates of potassium and magnesium for the purposes of this invention are preferably selected from the group consisting of potassium aspartate C4H6KN04 . magnesium aspartate C8R12MgN208 , potassium orotate C5113N204,K 2.5H20 , magnesium orotate C5H3N204 Mg 2.5H2Q , and mixtures thereof and are employed between about 1.0 meq. to about 15.0 meq. per 250 ml. of an aqueous solution. The aqueous solution may be any aqueous solution compatible for the purposes of this invention but is preferably demineralized, carbon filtered potable water. More preferably, the chelates are employed between about 1.0 meq. to about 7,5 meq. per 250 ml. of the aqueous solution most preferably, between about 2.0 meq.to about 6.5 meq. per 250 ml. The more preferred chelates from the group consisting of potassium aspartate, magnesium aspartate, potassium orotate, and magnesium arDtate, are potassium rspartato and inagneslum psrtett. The pcsassign, abpartate is preferably employed such as to be between about 3.0 meq. to about l.0 meq per 250 ml. of the aqueous solution more preferably between about 5.0 meq. to about 7.5 meq. per 250 ml. and most preferably between about 6.0 meq. to about 6.5 meq. per 250 ml.Similarly, the magnesium aspartate is preferably employed such as to be between about 1.0 meq. to about 5.0 meq. per 250 ml. of the aqueous solution more preferably between about 1.0 meq. to about 3.0 meq. per 250 ml. and most preferably between about 2.0 meq. to about 2.15 meq. per 250 ml. It is generally preferred to employ the meq. of potassium aspartate and the meq. of magnesium aspartate in approximately a 3 to 1 ratio. The beverage composition of this invention also comprises per 250 ml. of the aqueous solution, between about 3.0 g. and about 12.0 g.of a sweetener agent selected from fructose. aspartame, and mixtures thereof. More preferably, the sweetener agent is fructose and comprises per 250 ml. of the aqueous solution between about 3.0 g. to about 8.0 g.of the beverage more preferably between about 3.0 g. to about 7.0 g.per 250 ml. and most preferably between about 4.0 g. to about 6.0 g.per 250 ml. Fructose is clearly the preferred sweetener agent for this invention because not only is it the sweetest of all sugars, but additionally, fructose does not cause a marked rise in blood sugar. This is important because high blood sugar levels also cause the production of insulin which will subsequently cause blood sugar levels to fall off rapidly to low or below normal levels. Such rapid decline in blood sugar levels results in immediate fatigue to the body. Fructose is prepared commercially in the crystalline form and even though it is presently one of ne mert expensive sugars, less fructose is to be used which akei it cost effective for the purposes of this invention. A tartness agent is preferably incorporated into the beverage compositions of this invention in order to control tartness. The preferred tartness agent is citric acid and includes between about 0.05 g.to about 0.6 g. per 250 ml. of the aqueous solution more preferably between about .075 g. to about 0.40 g. per 250 ml. and most preferably between about 0.15 g. to about 0.25 g. per 250 ml. A A pH adjusting agent is also preferably incorporated into the beverage compvsitions of this invention. with the preferred pH adjustihg agent being benzoic acid C7H602 . The pH adjusting agent, benzoic acid, preferably comprises between about 0.01 g. and about 0.04 g. per 250 ml. of the aqueous solution to preferably adjust the pH of rhe beverage between about 3.8 and about 4.2 more preferably between about 0.015 g. and about 0.035 g. er 250 ml. to more preferably adjust the pH between about 4.0 to about 4.2 and most preferably between about 0.02 g.to about 0.03 g. per 250 ml. to most preferably adjust the pH of the beverage to about 4.1. A flavoring agent is recommended for the beverage cotpositions of this invention in order to mask any unpalatable taste that may originate from pny of the beverage components of this invention. Preferred flavoring agents have been found to be the lemon flavor 109715 FDEO Fritche, Dodge and Olcottl and or the fruit punch flavor by FDEO. The flavoring agent s is employed such as to preferably comprise between about 0.2 ml. to about 0.45 ml. per 250 ml. of the aqueous solution and more pre ferably between about 0.25 ml. to about 0.4 ml. per 250 ml.Most preferably the beverage composition of this invention comprises between about 0.3 ml. to about 0.35 ml. per 250 ml. of the aqueous solution of the flavoring agent s . Another recommended agent for the beverage composition of this invention is a smoothness agent for controlling the smoothness of the beverage. My preferred smoothness agent is potassium citrate which is included in the beverage composition of this invention such as to be preferably between about 0.20 g. to about 0.60 g. per 250 ml. of the aqueous solution. The more preferred amount of the potassium citrate is between about 0.20 g. to about 0.5 g. per 250 ml. of the aqueous solution with the most preferred amount of potassium citrate being between about 0.275 g. to about 0.35 g. per 250 ml. of the aqueous solution.
