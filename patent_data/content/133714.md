# Process for the electrolytic etching of aluminium capacitor foil, and etched foil obtained thereby.

## Abstract
Aluminium foil exhibiting a good combination of capaci tance and mechanical strength is produced by an etching procedure that includes the steps of AC pre etching alumi nium foil in an acid bath containing hydrochloric acid and then, without removing the hydrochloric acid from the foil, etching the foil with a high density DC while the foil is immersed in an aqueous solution of sodium chloride and sodium sulfate.
