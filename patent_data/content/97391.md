# A packing container for pressurized contents and a method for manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A packing container for pressurized contents, e.g. beer or carbonated refreshing beverages, can be manufactured from different material combinations which together provide the packing container with the necessary strength as well as the required tightness for gas as well as liquid. In accordance with the invention a packing container is formed comprising an outer casing 1, 2 , which consists of several material layers and which provides the packing container with its strength and gas tightness, and a liquid tight inner container 15 of flexible plastic material. In the manufacture and filling of the packing container use is made of the capacity of the contents to give off gas so as to expand the inner container 15 until it lies closely against the outer shell 1, 2 and at the same time force the air out of the casing so that the packing container is rendered completely free of air.
