# Optical fault seeking apparatus for material webs.

## Abstract
Apparatus uses an optical device to scan the material point by point line by line. The optical scanning device consists of a laser light source 17 projecting a light beam via a micro objective 19 , a cylindrical lens 20 , and a further objective onto a mirror wheel arrangement 14 located substantially at the focus of a strip like concave mirror 23 . A light beam 24 , produced in the image space of the strip like concave mirror 23 , generates a light bead in a scanning plane through which the web passes. The mirror wheel 14 has at least first and second alternately operating types of mirror surfaces serving to alternately project light beads of different size and or shape onto the web to detect different types of faults. The different types of scanning light bead are produced either by different curvatures of the faces 15 and 16 of the mirror wheel 14 of by the use of other optical means also in combination with differently shaped faces of the mirror wheel. Using two mirror wheels in tandem is possible.
