## Abstract
The device is to be mounted only at the time of use to the main explosive charge in projectiles or explosive chains. A casing 10 is provided with a through hole 11 in which a percussion pin 12 is slidably positioned and a die member 22 removably mounted in which an explosion chamber 21 of frusto conical shape and with blind bottom is provided, including longitudinal slots 25 and other ducts 26, 27, 28 permitting the explosion gases, as generated by a caseless explosive pill 20 , to be conveyed to a main explosive charge. The caseless explosive pill 20 is exploded by adiabatic compression of air in the explosion chamber 21 .
