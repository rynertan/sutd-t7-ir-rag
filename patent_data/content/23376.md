# Electron discharge tube cooling system.

## Abstract
Evaporation cooling system in which part of a tube to be cooled is immersed in coolant in a boiler 15 , the cooling system further comprising a condenser 18 for vapour gene rated in the boiler 15 , and a coolant reservoir 11 . The flow of vapour from the boiler 15 to the condenser 18 produ cing in the boiler 15 a back pressure dependent on the dimensions of the pipe 17 . In order that a desired level 40 of coolant can be obtained for a range of back pressures, the coolant is supplied to the boiler via an overflow system 16 having an adjustable overflow level. The overflow system 16 comprises a chamber 31 open to atmosphere at the top 34 and having at the bottom 33 an opening 36 through which an overflow tube 35 passes. The opening 36 is pro vided with a liquid tight gland 37 comprising a compressi ble ring 42 and a pressure member 43 adjustable to allow the tube 35 to be slid through or to lock it in position.
