# A body implantable lead having a ring electrode, and a process for making same.

## Abstract
A bipolar pacing lead 14 has a ring electrode 10 secured to a coiled conductor 38 by swaging the coiled conductor between the ring electrode and a swaging core 32, the distal end of the coiled conductor 38 being positioned over the swaging core and into the ring electrode. The outer coiled conductor is mechanically swaged between the ring elec trode 10 and the swaging core 32 resulting in a mechanical and electrical joint. Insulation 12 extends over the outer ends of the ring electrode and is bonded to a band of insulation 30b which is held in an annular channel 28 of the ring electrode 10 so that the outer diameter of the insulation 12 at that point is substantially the same as outer diameter of the ring electrode 10.
