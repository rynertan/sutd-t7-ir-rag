# PROCESS FOR FABRICATING SEMICONDUCTOR INTEGRATED CIRCUIT DEVICES

## Abstract
After contact holes 23, 22 for the P and N type source or drain regions 12, 8 of P and N channel MOSFETs 6, 5 have been made at a common step, an N type impurity a ion implanted into at least the N type source or drain regions 12 through the contact holes 22 . The N type impurity is annealed to form an N type region 9 which is deeper than the N type source or drain regions 12 . During the annealing treatment, the N type source or drain regions 12 are covered with an insulating film.
