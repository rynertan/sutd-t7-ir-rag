# Monoclonal antibody useful in the diagnosis of human stomach or breast cancer.

## Abstract
A monoclonal antibody of the IgM class which is useful for the diagnosis of human stomach or breast cancers and which reacts with a glycoprotein antigen having a molecular weight by gel filtration of 1,000,000 or higher, the antigenic determinant recognized being a sugar chain with a sialic acid residue at an end thereof, has the following characteris tics 1 a reactivity with human cancers of the stomach, large intestine, pancreas, breast, lung, biliary duct, uterus and oesophagus 2 a reactivity with normal human sub maxillary gland, proximal renal tubule, bronchial gland, squamous epithelial corneum, pancreatic Langerhans is lands, liver cell membrane and duodenal gland 3 a reac tivity with human intestinal metaplastic gastric mucosa and 4 a non reactivity with normal human prostate gland, bili ary duct and pancreatic duct. The monoclonal antibody can be produced by administering or implanting cancer cells or tissue into an animal having no thymus, allowing the cells or tissue to propagate in the animal, administering T cells or both T cells and B cells to the animal, taking antibodyproduc ing B cells from the animal, fusing the B cells with myeloma cells, selecting fused cells producing an antibody against the cancer cells or tissue, cloning the fused cells and culturing the cloned cells.
