## Claims
Patent claims 1. A self fastening device for fastening ropes, cords, cable and the like, particularly for fastening tensile stressed ropes, cords, cables and the like, comprising at least a terminal 12 , a body 1 with seats 2 and 4 for a fastening member 61 a spring 3 and a cord 11 , wherein the self fastening member 3 is shaped like a ball and is idly and loosly pivoted on a shank 8 of a reel shaped member 80 which is slidably mounted in a pair of slots 9 and projects outside with a pair of operable flanges 8a and 8b , the ball and shank size being such that in operation rolling friction conditions between self fastening member 6 and its seat 2 are determined. 2. Self fastening device, as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that the spring 3 at least at the end engaging the ball 6 is shaped like a truncate cone and its terminal turns adjacent to the ball like self fastening member 6 are closed i.e. provide a strenght neck. 3. Self fastening device as claimed in claims 1 and 2, charachterized in that the body 1 of device is widely bevelled at the passage inlet 7 and outet 5 for the rope, cord, cable or the like 11 .

## Description
Self fastening device for ropes, cords, cables and the likeIt is an object of the present invention a selffastening device for ropes, cords, cables, and the like, particularly for fastening tensile stressed ropes, cords, cables and the like.At the present status of the art a number of selffastening devicesfor ropes, cords, cables and the like are known for several uses and which have one or more drawbacks. All of them comprise a connector member or cord terminal, and a body housing a spring, a fastening means and a receiving seat for rope, cord, cable or the like which provides an acute angle with the self fastening means shifting seat.Known devices may be substantially arranged in two classes. A first class comprises all those devices in which the self fastening member operates inside the housing body and has no outer seizable projections to drive the same and to disengage and therefore to release the rope, cord, cable or the like. In a second class may be classified those devices wherein the self fastening member is cylindrical and is provided with outer projections which are operable to release the rope, cord, cable or the like.From the noint of view of the effectiveness Cf the device the former were better due to the fact that the self fastening member could be formed as a spherical or as a swelled or arcuate in two directions body. The latter were less advantageous then the former as it was thogIt that the outer projection of the self fastening member could be provided only together with a cylindrical shape.From a constructive noint of view in both classes but over all in the latter difficulties were found to provide spring self fastening member units particularly effective and cheap.The aim of the present invention is to eliminate the aforesaid disadvantages and to offer, furthermore various advantages.The inventor, has conceived a self fastening unit substantially formed as a sphere which is idly pivoted on the shank of a reel shaped member whose flanges project outside to provide releasing members for the self fastening member. On the other side the spherical shape of the self fastening member provides a spontaneous matching between the spherical surface of same selffastening member and the spring end which according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is a truncate conical spring end. The present invention will hereinafter be further described by way of example with reference to the accom panying drawings in which Figure 1 is an axial vertical longitudinal cross section view of a device according to the present invention in operation.Figure 2 is an axial horyzontal longitudinal crosssection view of device as shown in figure 1.Referring now to the drawing figures there is shown a self fastening device for ropes, cords, cables and the like, particularly for fastening tensile stressed ropes, cords, cables and the like compising convention ally a terminal preferably in the form of an hook 12, a substantially solid body having Ã…a seat for receiving self fastening member 80 and a passage for receiving theretiough a rope, cord, cable or the like and firming an acute angle with the seat 2 for receiving the selffastening member, a self fastening member 80 and a spring 3. The self fastening member 80 is longer tudinally movably mounted in a pair of slots 9 and projects out from body 1 with a pair of ring units 8a and 8b.Conventionally, a rope, cord, cable or the like is slipped through from the end mouth opposed to the hook 12 after having urged the self fastening mem ber 80 in opposition to the force of spring 3.This is obtained by driving on projection ends 8a and t f 311iStat v x 8b. Releasing the self fastening member i.e. releasiw spring 3, the self fastening member 80 engages ropes, cord, cables or the like 11 fastening them to the body 1 the more the rope is drawn the hardest it becomes fastened. According to the present invention the self fastening member 80 is substantially shaped like a ball 6 and is loosey and idly mounted on shaft 8 of member 80.Spherical member 6 is sized both relatively to the bore 2 and shaft 8 diameter so that when the spherical member 6 is radially urged by rope 11 against opposite side of base 2 it is not impeded by shaft 8. In this way a condition of rolling friction between spherical member 6 and base 2 is provided. According to a pref erred embodiment of the invention the throat inlet 7 and outlet 5 are bevelled.
