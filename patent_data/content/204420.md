# Apparatus for performing a fast fourier transform.

## Abstract
In a railway vehicle safety system, a frequency modulated signal is transmitted to a vehicle informing, inter alia, of a safe maximum speed, the said speed being represented by the carrier modulation frequency. In addition, the frequency of the carrier may possess one of a number of alternative fre quencies. Apparatus for analysing received signals to identify the carrier frequency and the modulation frequency employs a fast Fourier transform processor. In order to save computa tion time by eliminating useless calculations, a received sig nal is heteroydned by a local signal selected according to the carrier frequency identified and the base band components are analysed to identify the modulation frequency. A first stage transform is performed to identify the carrier signal and select the local signal frequency for a complex heterodyne process in a second stage in which local signals in phase quadrature are mixed with the received signal and the results sampled to provide data for real and imaginary data arrays for the transform process. As a result of the second stage pro cess, noise and common mode interference signals are re jected.
