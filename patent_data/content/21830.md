# Low sudsing detergent compositions.

## Abstract
Low sudsing detergent compositions are manufactured by the use of anionic detergent active sulphate compounds selected according to their calcium salt solubility product and their critical micelle concentration, and by the use of a non soap anti foam compound. Preferred anionic sulphates are the primary and secondary alkyl sulphates having particular carbon chain length distributions, and a preferred non soap anti foam is an alkyl phosphate ester, desirably used in conjunction with a hydrophobic wax or oil.

## Description
LOW SUSSING DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to detergent compositions intended for fabric washing. It is now conventional for detergent compositions designed for front loaiiig washing machines to be formulated as low sudsing compositions. The commonest types of low sudsing compositions are the so called ternary products, i.e. those based on mixtures of anionic surfactants, most commonly long chain alkyl benzene sulphonates and nonionic surfactants in which the sudsiRg capacity is controlled by the use of a calcium soap, formed in situ by the reaction of sodium salts of fatty acids and calcium ions forming part of the water hardness.The nonionic surfactant also exerts an effect in controlling foam in these formulations as well as contributing to the detergency properties of the systemThe detergencies obtained from the compositions outlined above, which are embodied in consumer products such as Persil Automatic and Bold Automatic registered TradeMarks are quite acceptable. We have now discovered that by careful selection of anionic surfactants, detergent compositions can be produced which do not require the presence of nonionic surfactants but which exhibit equivalent detergency and suds control to those of ternary products. At the same time the use of long chain alkyl benzene sulphonates, which can be environmentally unsatisfactory, is avoided. According to the present invention there is provided a detergent composition comprising an anionic sulphate surfactant or mixture of such surf actants having a a calcium salt solubility product greater than 1 x 10 12 moles3 litre 3 b a maximum critical micelle concentration of 6 x 10 2 gms litre together with a non soap anti foam. The significance of the parameters a and b in selecting the anionic surfactant for use in this invention can be summarised as follows The calcium salt solubility product is a measure of the tendency of the substance to precipitate from a solution containing calcium ions and anionic surfactant ions. In the absence of nonionic surfactants, which help to solubilise the other surfactants in the normal binary or ternary detergent formulations, control of precipitation boundaries is extremely important. The critical micelle concentration, of course, determines the point at which a substance attains maximum surface activity. For the purposes of this invention, both the solubility product and the critical micelle concentration are measured at 600C in the presence of 0.05 moles litre of sodium chloride. Reference to Tables 1 and 2 will enable the skilled man to determine which sulphate surfactants are inside and which are outside the invention.

The anionic surfactant may be present in the mixture in an amount of from 5 to 35 , preferably, for economic reasons, from 5 to 25 by weight of the composition. The specified anionic surfactants are sulphates rather than sulphonates, since in general the sulphates are much more biodegradable than the sulphonates. Within the sulphate class, primary and secondary alkyl sulphates are preferred. Most preferred are the high crystalline fraction secondary alkyl sulphates i.e. those in which a high percentage of the material has the sulphate group attached at the 2 or 3 position , particularly the C16 18 sulphates and the Cm 16 primary alcohol sulphates. The second essential component of the compositions of this invention is a non soap anti foam compound. Typical of non soap anti foam compounds are phosphate esters, both used alone and used in conjunction with waxes or hydrophobic oils such as mineral and vegetable oils. Silicone anti foams and derivatives of nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds such as s triazine may also be used. In general, the non soap anti foam compounds of this invention may be present in the compositions in amounts from 0.05 , which would be the mininnlm amount which could possibly be effective, to 5 , which would be the practical maximum having regard to the extreme efficacy of the majority of non soap anti foam compounds, to their expense and to the necessity for keeping as much room in the composition as possible for other compounds. In greater detail, the phosphate esters which may be used, optionally in salt form, have the following general formula EMI5.1 where A is OH or R20 E0 m , R1 and m are the same or different C12 C24, preferably C16 C22, straight or branched chain, saturated or unsaturated alkyl groups, especiallyC16 C18 linear saturated groups and m and n are the same or different and are 0 or an integer of from 1 to 6. Preferably,A is 0E and n is 0, so that the compounds are the monoalkyl phosphoric acids, preferably with linear alkyl groups.If any ethylene oxide EO groups are present in the alkyl phosphoric acids, they should not be too long in relation to the alkyl chain length to make the calcium or magnesium salts soluble in water during use. In practice, the alkyl phosphate compounds are commonly mixtures of both mono and di alkyl phosphoric acids, with a range of alkyl chain lengths. Predominantly monoalkyl phosphates are usually made by phosphorylation of alcohols or ethoxylated alcohols, when n or m is 1 to 6, musing a polyphosphoric acid. Phosphorylation may alternatively be accomplished using phosphorus peroxide, in which case the mixed mono and di alkyl phosphates are produced. Under optimum reaction conditions only small quantities of unreacted materials or by products are produced, and the reaction products can advantageously be used directly in the detergent compositions. When a mixture of phosphate ester and wax is to be used as the non soap anti foam compound the wax may be of synthetic, mineral, vegetable or animal origin, The waxes should normally melt at a temperature between about 200C and about 1200C, preferably not more than about 9QOQ and especially in the range of about 300C to about 7Q0C, i.e. lower than the maximum intended wash temperatures for the detergent compositions. When waxes having melting points above the maximum intended wash temperatures are used they should be adequately dispersed in the wash liquor by suitable incorporation in the original detergent compositions. The preferred waxes are of mineral origin, especially those derived from petroleum, including microcrystalline and oxidised microcrystalline petroleum waxes, petroleum jelly Vaseline and paraffin waxes. Petroleum jelly is correctly a semi solid wax, usually having a melting point about 30 40 0C, but is for convenience here grouped with other solid waxes. Synthetic waxes such as Fischer Tropsch and oxidised Fischer Tropsch waxes, or Montan waxes, or natural waxes such as beeswax, candelilla and carnauba waxes may be used if desired. Any of the waxes described may be used alone or in admixture with other waxes.The waxes should be readily dispersible in the detergent liquor but not soluble therein and, preferably, they should not have very high saponification values, e .g. not in excess of about 100.It is advantageous to include emulsifying or stabilising agents for the waxes in the detergent compositions. Examples of suitable coils which may be used if desired are vegetable oils such as sesame oil, cotton seed oil, corn oil, sweet almond oil, olive oil, wheat germ oil, rice bran oil, or peanut oil, or animal oils such as lanolin, neat s foot oil, bone oil, sperm oil or cod liver oil.Any such oils used should of course not be highly coloured, of strong odour or otherwise unacceptable for use in a detergent composition. The remaining components of the composition are conventional and will be present in conventional amounts, Sodium ortho , pyro and tripolyphosphates are amongst several suitable detergency builders which are well known and commercially available, whilst many more have been described in the literature, especially in recent patent specifications on replacements for these phosphate based materials. Other detergency builders which may be mentioned by way of example are alkali metal carbonates, especially sodium carbonate, alkali metal polyphosphonates, e.g. sodium ethane l hydroxy l,l diphosphonate, alkali metal amine carboxylates, such as sodium nitrilotriacetate and sodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate, alkali metal ether carboxylates, such as sodium oxydiacetate, sodium carboxymethyloxysuccinate, sodium carboxymethyloxymalonate and homologues thereof, alkali metal citrates, alkali metal mellitates and salts of polymeric carboxylic acids, such as sodium polymaleate, copolyethylenemaleate, polyitaconate and polyacrylate. When sodium carbonate is used as a detergency builder, it is advantageous to have present some calcium carbonate having a surface area of at least about 10 mê g as described in UK patent 1,437,950. Another type of detergency builder which can be used, either alone or in admixture with other builders, is a cation exchange material, especially a sodium aluminosilicate such as described in UK patent 1,429,143 or in Netherlands patent application 7403381. Preferred materials of this type have the formula N0 0.71.l A12 3 i 2 1 3 3 and may be amorphous or crystalline, with some bound water usually in an amount of about 10 30 depending on the drying conditions used. Such sodium aluminosilicate materials should, of course, be very finely divided so as to minims sue deposition on the fabrics during washing. The amount of the detergency builder which is used is normally from about 5 up to about 80 by weight of the composition, preferably about 10 to about 60 , and the ratio by weight of the detergency builders to the detergent active compounds which are used is generally from about 10 1 to about 1 5 parts by weight. The detergent compositions of the invention may take any of the usual physical forms, preferably as solid compositions, for example as powders, granules, flakes, ribbons, noodles or tablets, or they may be in liquid or paste form. The detergent compositions may also be made by any of the conventional processes for making detergent compositions, especially by the technique of slurry making and spraydrying in the case of the preferred powder detergent compositions. The detergent compositions of the invention may also include any of the conventional optional additives in the amounts usually employed in detergent compositions.Examples of these additives include powder flow aids such as finely divided silicas and aluminosilicates, other lather controllers, anti redeposition agents such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, oxygen releasing bleaching such as sodium perborate and sodium percarbonate, per acid bleach precursors such as tetraacetylethylenediamine, chlorine releasing bleaching agents such as trichloroisocyanuric acid and alkali metal salts of dichloroisocyanuric acid, fabric softening agents such as clays of the smectite and illite types, anti ashing aids, starchs, slurry stabilisers such as copolyethylenemaleic anhydride and copolyvinylmethylether maleic anhydride, usually in salt form, inorganic salt such as sodium silicates and sodium sulphate, and usually present in very minor amounts, fluorescent agents, perfumes, enzymes such as proteases and amylases, germicides and colourants. The detergent compositions usually have an alkaline pH, generally in the region of pit 9 11, which is achieved by the presence of alkaline salts, especially sodium silicates such as the meta , neutral or alkaline silicates, preferably at levels up to about 15 by weight. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples in which parts and percentages are by weight except where otherwise indicated.
