# Apparatus and method for generating electrical synchronization signals for fuel injection control.

## Abstract
Synchronization pulses are developed in timed relation to the occurrence of an ignition event in a specified cylinder of an engine employing a concurrent discharge ignition system. Ignition voltages for compression and exhaust cylinders are distinguished on the basis of the voltage magnitudes thereof.
