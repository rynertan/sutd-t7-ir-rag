## Abstract
The invention relates to a shaving apparatus having a shear plate 3 with hair entry apertures 4 and a cutting unit 5 which is movable relative to the shear plate, which cutting unit comprises a cutting element 21 with cutters 25 , each cutter being provided with a hair pulling blade 27 which precedes said cutter in the direction of driving. In order to enable such a shaving apparatus to be driven at a high speed the hair pulling blades 27 are elastically coupled to the cutting element 21 so that a hair pulling blade is movable over a limited distance relative to the cutting element in a direction opposite to the direction of driving.
