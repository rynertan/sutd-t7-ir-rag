## Description
DISC BRAKES This invention relates to disc brakes for motorcycles and other two wheeled vehicles. It has been proposed to provide rotatably on one end portion of an axle a wheel hub having a peripheral brake disc and with a central hollow shaft supported on the axle and to provide on the other end portion of the axle a brake caliper assembly with the axle inserted in a central bore of this assembly, the caliper assembly being supported on the axle only at a place near one side of the assembly. In such a construction, whereas the caliper assembly is supported only near one side, external force from the brake disc during braking operation acts on the caliper assembly at a place near its other side, thus involving the disadvantage that twisting can easily develop and stable braking operation is difficult to obtain. According to the present invention there is provided a dise brake assembly comprising a brake disc peripherally carried by the hub of the wheel to be braked, and a brake caliper assembly, the hub and the caliper assembly being mounted side by side on an axle for the wheel with the axle passing through a central hollow shaft of the hub and through a central bore of the caliper assembly characterised in that the caliper assembly is supported from the axle at two places that are relatively widely distanced apart. As in this construction the br ke caliper assembly is supported at two places that are relatively widely distanced apart, the assembly is stably supported in a manner to resist twisting during braking. The stable support can be enhanced in various ways as will be described hereinbelow. It has also been previously proposed to provide rotatably on one end portion of an axle a wheel hub having a peripheral brake disc and with a central hollow shaft supported on the axle to provide on the other end portion of the axle a brake caliper assembly with the axle inserted in a central bore of the caliper assembly and to couple the caliper assembly with the frame of the motorcycle or other vehicle through a torque link extending substantially tangentially of the brake disc. The caliper assembly is slidable on the axle in proportion to wear on each brake pad opposing the disc, and it is preferable that the torque link should be able smoothly to follow this movement of the caliper assembly.To achieve this, as will be made clear hereinafter, the present invention further provides, in a disc brake assembly as already defined, a torque link for connection between the brake caliper assembly and a member of the frame of a vehicle in which the disc brake assembly is to be fitted, the disc brake assembly being further characterised in that a resilient bush including an intermediate rubber layer is provided at each end of the torque link, the torque link being connected to the caliper assembly and to the vehicle frame member via these resilient bushes. In addition in a dis brake assembly as already defined, and in which the caliper assembly includes outer and inner caliper members, the invention provides that the outer caliper member includes a portion formed as an annular cover for the inner caliper member and the brake disc and pads of the disc brake assembly. Preferably, in this case, the annular cover covoper tes with an annular flange carried by the inner caliper member to form a labyrinth seal zone. Furthermore provision can be made for the brake caliper assembly of the disc brake assembly to contain lubricating medium. For a better understanding of the invention and to show how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a somewhat schematic side view of a motorcycle, Figure 2 is a side view, partly cut away and in section and drawn to a larger scale, of a disc brake assembly and associated components of the motorcycle of Figure 1, Figure 3 is a sectional view taken on the line III III in Figure 2, Figure 4 is a detail sectional view taken on the line IV IV in Figure 2, and Figures 5 to 9 are sectional side views each of part of a disc brake assembly and associated components as shown in Figure 3 but illustrating different forms. Referring first to Figures 1 to 4 of the drawings, in the region of the rear wheel of the motorcycle or other two wheeled vehicle , the frame includes a rear fork member 1 supporting one end of the rear wheel axle 2. A rear wheel hub 3 having a central hollow shaft 4 is provided with a sprocket 5 on its periphery and a further sprocket 6 at one end. An annular brake disc 7 is fixed to the hub 3 by bolts and nuts 8. The hollow shaft 4 is supported on the axle 2 by a pair of ball bearings 9 9. A brake caliper assembly 10 is supported loosely on the axle 2 by a collar 11 entered in a central bore 12 in an outer calper member 13 of the assembly, the collar 11 fieing t edlS held between the end of the rear fork member 1 and the ball bearing 9 opposed thereto. A barrel shaped supporting member 14 extending inwards from the inner end of the collar 11 is practically in contact with an inner caliper member 15 of the caliper assembly so as to support it from its inner peripheral surface at a zone that contains the ball bearing 9 adjacent the member 14 collar 11. The two caliper members 13,15 carry at least one pair of brake pads i6,16 on surfaces opposed to the disc 7, and a caliper piston 17 that acts on one of the pads 16,16. By advancing movement of the piston 17 the two pads 16,16 are caused to close to grip the disc 7 therebetween in conventional fashion. The pads 16,16 are located by a pin 18, and bolts 19 secure the two caliper members 13,15 to each other. Between the disc brake assembly components so far described and a part of the rear fork member 1 remote from the components there extends a torque link 20, disposed substantially tangentially of the brake disc 7. Each end of this torque link 20 is supported, via a bush 21, on a pin 23, each bush 21 being composed of two rigid layers with a rubber layer 22 therebetween so that a resilient bush is formed as a whole. At the brake end the pin 23 is secured in a lug 24 projecting from the caliper assembly 10. At the rear fork member end the pin 23 is secured in a lug 25 extending from the fork member 1. The components so far described operate as follows. By closing the twQ pads 16,16 as a result of advancing movement of the caliper piston 17, the brake disc 7 is gripped from both sides to effect braking. Braking torque generated therefrom is transmitted through the torque link 20 to the rear fork and therefore to the rame of the motorcycle, all in a manner as previously proposed However, in the present construction as each pad 16 becomes worn, and the caliper assembly 10 moves on the axle 2 correspondingly to compensate for this wear, in which case the torque link 20 tends to oscillate somewhat laterally, such oscillation is absorbed by the rubber layers 22 of the bushes 21 and hence the torque link 20 is able smoothly to follow this movement of the caliper assembly 10. Askas already been described, the caliper assembly 10 has between its two caliper members 13, 15, the barrel shaped supporting member 14. As shown in Figure 3, this member 14 has the collar 11 inserted in its central bore and is fixed thereto by welding or some other means. As an alternative, a supporting member 14A as illustrated in Figure 5 can be mounted directly on the axle 2 entered in the central bore of the supporting member , the member 14A being held between the collar 11 and the adjacent ball bearing 9.In either case, in operation as the two pads 16,16 are operated to brake the wheel hub, during such operation the brake caliper assembly leo is supported at its central bore 12 on one side by the axle 2 at a zone that has a radial plane common with the zone at which the torque link 20 is connected to the assembly 10, and at an internal peripheral surface on the other side by the supporting member 14 or 14A at a zone that has a radial plane common with the brake disc 7.Forces acting on the caliper assembly 10 during braking are a braking force A developed at the brake disc 3 and a reaction force B developed at the connection with the torque link 20, but as the two places at which the assembly 10 is supported, and which are relatively widely distanced apart, are respectively in line with, or substantially in line with, the points at which the lines Q I application of these forces A and B pass through the axle 2, the assembly 10 is held stably.This is also the case in the form shown in Figure 6 in which the outer caliper member 13 includes a portion formed as an annular cover for other parts of the disc brake assembly, the radially outer peripheral part of the caliper member 13 terminating in an inwardly directed flange 13A that terminates in overlapping relationship with an annular flange 26 projecting outwardly from the wheel hub 3, so that a labyrinth seal zone 27 is provided where the flanges 13A and 26 overlap one another. The inner caliper member 15, the brake disc 7 and the brake pads 16,16 are all contained within this zone 27 and hence are protected from muddy water and the like, whereby the service life of the disc and the pads tends to be lengthened. It is also to be noted that in this form the collar 11 and supporting member 14 are replaced by a one piece collar and support 14A having, overall, effectively the same configuration as the collar t1 and supporting member 14 taken together. The problem of twisting occurring in operation has already been discussed above, and it has been described how, in the brake caliper assemblies so far described with reference to the accompanying drawings, to resist twisting, support is provided at two places that are relatively widely distanced apart. In the form of Figure 7 there is also, inter alia, support at two places that are relatively widely distanced apart, but in this case there is continuous support between these places. in this form the brake caliper assembly 10A has only one caliper member 28 which carries not only the caliper piston 17 of the assembly and one of the pads 16, but also the other pad 16.This single caliper member 28 has a central hub portion 29 that is elongated axially, the caliper member 28 being supported on the collar 11 which is entered in a central bore 30 of the central hub portion 29. The axial length of the hub portion 2g, and hence of the bore 30, is such that the caliper assembly 10A is supported, inter alia, where the lines of application of the braking force A and the reaction force B, developed during braking, pass through the axle 2. To this end, the bore 30 extends from a zone having a radial plane common with the brake disc 7 to beyond a zone having a radial plane common with the zone at which the torque link 20 is connected to the assembly 10A. Further to improve the support of the caliper assembly 10, in the form shown in Figure 8, the ball bearing member 9 nearest the collar 11, the zone at which the support member 14 supports the inner caliper member 15, and the brake disc 7 are disposed so as to have a common radial plane X X that passes through the centre of the brake disc 2 and substantially through the centres of the zone at which the support member 14 supports the inner caliper member 15 esee point Y in Figure 8 and of the bearing member 9 nearest the collar 11 point Z .In braking operation, friction force the braking force A generated between the disc 2 and the pads 16,16 acts on the bearing member 9 nearest the collar 11 through the wheel hub 3 so far as the disc 2 side is concerned, and as there is no overhanging relationship between the disc 2 and the bearing member 9 there is no moment increase in this force and the bearing member 9 gives stable support without the occurrence of twist. Similarly, and as already discussed as the braking force A acts on the support member 14 through the inner caliper member 15 so far as the pads 16,16 side is concerned, and as the point Y is substantially coplanar with the centre of the disc 2, no moment increase in force occurs, so that no twist is produced. Finally, in the torm shown in Figure 9 there is only a single caliper member 28A as in the case of the form of Figure 7, but here support for this member utilises the one piece collar and support member 14A of the form of Figure 6. Between this member 14A and the caliper member 28A there is a chamber 31 that is filled with grease or other libricant, this chamber being sealed at each end by an 0 ring seal 32 or 33. Similar chambers 31 that can be filled with grease are provided in the forms of Figures 3,5,6 and 8 and Figures 3,6 and 8 also illustrate a sealing boot 34 that can be fitted in addition to the O ring seal 32 Figures 3 and 8 or instead of the seal 32 Figure 6 . In operation, the grease in the chamber 31 libricates the sliding surfaces on which the brake caliper assembly is supported.
