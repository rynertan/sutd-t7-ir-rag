# Method of constructing a ball joint and fixture for use in that method.

## Abstract
A method for constructing a ball joint includes the steps of positioning a ball 36 within a ball joint socket 12 . Plastic bearing material 16 is then allowed to congeal in the socket 12 while in contact with the ball 36 . A positioning fixture 40 maintains the ball 36 in the desired spaced position in the socket 12 while also maintaining a seal between the ball 36 and the socket housing 12 so that the bearing material 16 may be pressurized as it congeals.
