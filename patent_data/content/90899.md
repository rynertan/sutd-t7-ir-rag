# Improvements in or relating to implant devices.

## Abstract
Implants 50 may be placed in animals in the field with a system including an implanter 10 and cartridge like con tainer 30 for a plurality of implants. The cartridge is transparent and encloses a plurality of elongated implants arranged side to side, transverse to the longitudinal axis of the cartridge. The implants may be moved manually 33 along the longitudinal axis of the cartridge toward one end and stopped in alignment parallel with the end 39 of the cartridge and with one implant aligned with a pair of openings 37, 38 in the cartridge, one opening at each end of the implant. The implanter carries a sharpened tubular needle 25 and a plunger, slidable along an axis aligned with the central axis of the tubular needle. The implanter has an opening 20 into which the cartridge may be fitted and retained. The implanter and cartridge have interfitting sur faces 28a, 28b, 27, 31c, 31d to position the cartridge with its pair of openings lying upon the central axis of the hollow needle and to retain the cartridge in the implanter so that the plunger may be passed repeatedly through the pair of openings in the cartridge and move the implants, one after the other, through the sharpened tubular needle 25 into the animals. The implants thus are protected from contamina tion until implantation.
