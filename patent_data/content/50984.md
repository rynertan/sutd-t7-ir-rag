# Thoracic drainage device.

## Abstract
A thoracic drainage unit for removal of fluids from the thoracic cavity of a patient and or to assist a patient in breathing comprises a collection chamber for receiving the fluids from the patient and an underwater seal located beween the collection chamber and the patient. The under water seal prevents pressure being applied to the thoracic cavity or back flow to that cavity. The water or other liquid for the seal is provided with the collection chamber as a complete unit ready for use. A collapsible bottle has a breakable neck that is readily broken by the user, whereupon the bottle is collapsed to force the liquid therein to create the liquid seal. A means is provided to prevent the liquid from re entering the bottle as it re expands so that the precise needed volume of liquid is retained to create the seal. Also, the water seal is located in a particular location, and the underwater seal chamber is designed such that seal integrity is not lost upon tipping over the drainage unit and the seal remains viable upon re righting the unit. The underwater seal chamber is designed to allow viewing of an air leak from the patient, even foaming or opaque fluid. Critical measurement area for collected fluids is provided, and hangers that can be used also as floor stands are included with unit.
