## Description
The invention relates to a process for selectively producing aromatic hydroxycarboxylic acids, which comprises liquefying an alkali metal salt of an aromatic hydroxy compound with an added aromatic hydroxy compound, followed by reaction with carbon dioxide in a liquid liquid mixture with a medium. Aromatic hydroxycarboxylic acids, particularly p hydroxybenzoic acid, salicylic acid, 2 hydroxy 3 naphthoic acid, etc., have long been known for their usefulness as a raw material for the production of antiseptic and antifungal agents, pharmaceuticals, dyestuffs, pigments and the like, and in recent years, have furthermore acquired increasingly greater importance not only as a starting compound for the synthesis of agricultural chemicals, color developing agents for thermosensitive recording paper, etc. but also as a monomer for aromatic polyesters. These aromatic hydroxycarboxylic acids have conventionally been produced by means of the so called Kolbe Schmitt process involving a vapor solid phase reaction of an alkali metal salt of an aromatic hydroxy compound with carbon dioxide. For example, EP A 66205 describes the preparation of 2 hydroxynaphthalene 3 carboxylic acid by a process which comprises reacting carbon dioxide with a mixture of potassium β naphtholate, β naphthol and a reaction medium comprising aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic hydrocarbons, or aromatic ethers. JP A 55 35042 discloses the reaction of carbon dioxide with a mixture comprising sodium β naphtholate, β naphthol and an aromatic hydrocarbon and or an aromatic ether. Those aromatic hydrocarbons include diphenyls and alkyl substituted naphtholenes. In EP A 53824, 2 hydroxy naphthalene 6 carboxylic acid is produced by reaction between carbon dioxide and a mixture comprising potassium β naphtholate and β naphthol. The reaction medium may be aliphatic, alicyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Lately, one of the present inventors has improved the said vapor solid phase reaction process into the liquid solid phase reaction process making use of a suspension phase, and thus, there has been established a process which permits an industrial scale, mass production of such aromatic hydroxycarboxylic acids refer to the specification of Patent Application No. 39281 1983 Laid Open Patent Publication No. 164751 1984 . The present inventors, with a specific view to further improving the process, carried out repeated research, and found that triaryl based polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons remaining liquid at ambient temperature and showing a boiling point of not less than 250 C can produce excellent effects under conditions of an added aromatic hydroxy compound. The finding has led to the completion of this invention. This invention is directed to a process for producing p hydroxy benzoic acid..., etc as claim 1. The present invention aims to provide the following effects The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which are used in this invention are hydrogenated triphenyls or mixtures thereof, and those having a boiling point of not less than 250 C are desirable. The alkali metal salts of aromatic hydroxy compounds are potassium phenolate, and sodium 2 naphtholate. In the Kolbe Schmitt reaction process, the complete dehydration of a raw material, an alkali metal salt of aromatic hydroxy compound, constitutes one of the most important problems, and inadequate dehydration of the above described raw material results in a marked decrease in reaction yield. The above raw material can be produced in accordance with the conventional method by the reaction of phenol or 2 naphthol with an alkaline potassium or sodium compound, such as hydroxides, carbonates and hydrogencarbonates of potassium or sodium, and it is particularly advantageous to dehydrate the resulting alkali metal salt of aromatic hydroxy compound in the presence of the above mentioned reaction medium. According to this invention, the reaction of an alkali metal salt of aromatic hydroxy compound with carbon dioxide is carried out at a temperature of not lower than 100 C, preferably 120 to 300 C, particularly 150 to 300 C, and at a carbon dioxide pressure of not higher than 3 10³ kPa 30 kg cm² G , preferably 98 to 1500 kPa 1 to 15 kg cm² G particularly 200 to 1000 kPa 2 to 10 kg cm² G . The addition amount of the aromatic hydroxy compound is normally 0.1 to 2 mole per mole of alkali metal salt of aromatic hydroxy compound. The usage amount of the reaction medium is normally 1 to 5 part by weight against each part by weight of alkali metal salt of aromatic hydroxy compound. The reaction can be conducted either by the batch or continuous process, but it is desirable to carry out the reaction by the continuous process. As the reaction time or the residence time, there can be suitably selected any length of time ranging from several minutes to 15 hours, preferably 10 minutes to 10 hours, particularly 20 minutes to 10 hours. The finishing treatment can be conducted, for example, by the following procedure. After addition of water to the reaction mixture, the reaction medium layer is separated out, and the dissolved aromatic hydroxy compound can be recovered with a solution of an alkaline potassium or sodium compound as an alkali metal salt of the aromatic hydroxy compound, which is then subjected to reuse. The separated water layer is adjusted in liquid nature with dilute or concentrated sulfuric acid, and the dissolved aromatic hydroxy compound is then extracted with use of toluene or xylene as a reaction medium or organic solvent, as the case may be. The organic solvent layer is washed with a solution of an alkaline potassium or sodium compound to recover it as an alkali metal salt of the aromatic hydroxy compound for reuse as a starting compound. Alternatively, the whole amount of the organic solvent layer can be distilled off to separate into the organic solvent and the aromatic hydroxy compound, with the latter being reused as a starting compound. These finishing treatment procedures can be suitably selected. The present invention can offer various advantages as described above under the items 1 through 9 , and is of industrial value.

In a pressure reaction vessel were charged 100g of potassium phenolate, 35g of phenol and 400g of a mixture of hydrogenated triphenyls, and a reaction was allowed to proceed at 250 C and at a carbon dioxide pressure of 690 kPa 7 kg cm² G for 20 minutes, with stirring.

The water layer was extracted with 50g of xylene, and the phenol was recovered with an aqueous potassium hydroxide solution from the reaction medium and extraction medium layers. After recovery of phenol, the water layer was made acid with dilute sulfuric acid to give 80.8g of p hydroxybenzoic acid having a purity of 100 , with neither salicylic acid nor isophthalic acid being detected as an isomer. The yield based on potassium phenolate was 77.3 , and the recovered phenol was 21.8g, with the selectivity being 99.7 . In a pressure reaction vessel were charged 166g of sodium 2 naphtholate, 72g Of 2 naphthol and 498g of hydrogenated triphenyl, and a reaction was allowed to proceed at 260 C and at a carbon dioxide pressure of 490 kPa 5 kg cm² G for 3 hours, with stirring. The reaction mixture was charged into 800 ml of water, and the resulting mixture was adjusted to a pH 5.5 with sulfuric acid, followed by separation into the reaction medium layer and the water layer at 85 C. The 2 naphthol was recovered with an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution from the reaction medium layer. After recovery of 2 naphthol, the water layer was adjusted to a pH 2.0 with sulfuric acid at the same temperature, cooled to 40 C and subjected to filtration to give 89.3g of 2 hydroxynaphthalene 3 carboxylic acid. The product was found to contain only 0.1 of 2 hydroxynaphthalene 6 carboxylic acid, with no trace of 2 hydroxynaphthalene 1 carboxylic acid. The yield based on sodium 2 naphtholate was 47.5 , with the selectivity being 99.3 . A finishing treatment was carried out continuously, while employing the facilities as shown in the drawing. On an hourly basis, 83 kg of sodium 2 naphtholate, 42 kg of 2 naphthol and 166 kg of a mixture of hydrogenated triphenyls were fed to a stirring tank 1, followed by stirring and suspension.
