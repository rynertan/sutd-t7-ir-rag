# Method of impregnating ceramic monolithic structures with predetermined amounts of catalyst.

## Abstract
A method for impregnating the interior skeletal struc ture of a ceramic monolithic catalyst support with a slurry of catalyst material is disclosed wherein a predetermined amount of catalyst slurry is metered into contact with a first end of the support. A cover is placed over the periphery of a second, opposite end of the support in sealing relation there to to define a vacuum chamber adjacent to the second end. A vacuum is drawn on the cover to draw catalyst slurry into the skeletal structure from the second end whereby the in terior skeletal structure is uniformly impregnated with the catalyst slurry.
