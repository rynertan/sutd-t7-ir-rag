## Description
DESCRIPTION ROAST AND GROUND APPEARING FREEZE DRIED COFFEE AND A METHOD FOR PRODUCING THE SAMETECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a method of producing a freeze dried soluble coffee. More particularly, the invention involves a method of producing a freeze dried coffee with a multi colored appearance resembling that of roast and ground coffee by first separately extracting the atmospherically extractable solids and the hydrolysis solids and the extracts are frozen which frozen extracts are then ground and freeze dried.BACKGROUND ART It has long been desired to produce a freezedried soluble coffee with an appearance closely resembling that of roast and ground coffee. Much effort has been directed towards producing a darkcolored freeze dried coffee on the feeling that such a coffee more nearly resembles roast and ground coffee as compared to a light colored freeze dried coffee. For instance, U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,253,420 ofDe George, 3,399,061 of Lutz, 3,433,963 of Simon et al., and 3,966,979 of Katz et al., all deal with controlling the freezing rate of coffee extract in order to produce a dark colored freeze dried coffee.A similar object is disclosed in commonly assignedU.S. Pat. App. No. 353,280 to Hudak. Inspection of roast and ground coffee, however, reveals that it is comprised of particles exhibiting a variety of colors, ranging between light and dark. Thus, a freeze dried coffee of one color, albeit a dark color, is less desirable then a multi colored freezedried coffee. The hereinabove described art relates to freeze drying a typical commercial coffee extract, but at least two different types of coffee extracts are recognized in the art. The first such extract, known as atmospheric extract, is comprised of atmospheric coffee solids leached from roast and ground coffee at a temperature typically less than 1000C and at a pressure close to atmospheric. The second type of extract, so called hydrolysis extract, is produced after extraction of the atmospheric solids and is extracted at conditions sufficient to hydrolyze and solubilize otherwise insoluble starches and celluloses present in roasted coffee. A typical commercial coffee extract is comprised of both types. Methods of producing the coffee extracts are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,888,349 of Morrow et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 3,458,320 of Niven.The art has not heretofore revealed the separate treatment of said coffee extracts to produce a novel freezedried coffee. It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of producing a freeze dried coffee with a multi colored appearance resembling that of roast and ground coffee. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method for producing such a freeze dried coffee which method takes advantage of the two distinct types of coffee extract.Disclosure of the Invention It has now been discovered that a freeze dried coffee with a multi colored appearance resembling that of roast and ground coffee is produced by initially separately extracting the atmospherically extractable solids and hydrolysis solids from roast and ground coffee, the extracts are frozen and the frozen extract is subsequently ground and freeze dried.The freeze dried coffee resulting therefrom is a multi colored product resembling the appearance of roast and ground coffee. As hereinabove described, roast and ground coffee may be extracted under different conditions to produce two distinct types of extracts. The so called atmospheric extract is obtained by contacting roast and ground coffee, such as is contained in a typical commercial percolator column, with water at a temperature usually less than 1000C at a pressure typically close to atmospheric said atmospheric extract contains substantially all of the aromatic and flavor compounds generally extractable from roast and ground coffee and is consequently very desirable and flavorful. Hydolysis extract, on the other hand, is typically produced by contacting the previously extracted roast and ground coffee with water at a temperature in excess of 1750C and at a pressure of about 18 atmospheres.A standard commercial coffee extract contains both the atmospheric and hydrolysis portion although the art, inU.S. Pat. Nos. 2,888,349 of Morrow et al. and 3,458,320 of Niven, for example, disclose methods of obtaining the two extracts separately. For purposes of the present invention, the two extracts may be obtained from the same or different charges of roast and ground coffee. In the preferred scheme, the roast and ground charge is atmospherically extracted and then separately extracted under hydrolysis conditions in order to obtain the hydrolysis extract.It is possible though, to atmospherically extract the roast and ground coffee and then obtain the hydrolysis extract from a different charge of roast and ground coffee. It is wasteful and hence, expensive to merely atmospherically extract the coffee without also separately extracting the hydrolysis solids and the practice is not recommended. According to one embodiment of the invention, the coffee extracts are separately frozen and freezedried. Freezing is conveniently carried out on a continuous, moving metal belt which is chilled underneath by a series of progressively colder brine reservoirs. This method of freezing is described more fully in U.S. Pat. No. 3,253,420 of De George.The frozen extracts are then freeze dried according to techniques well known in the art. Freeze drying basically entails heating the frozen coffee material while maintaining a suitably high vacuum whereby water passes directly from the frozen state to the vapor state. It is a discovery of the present invention that the separately freeze dried coffee extracts are widely different in color the freezedried atmospheric extract is very dark colored whereas the freeze dried hydrolysis extract is lighter colored. The freeze dried coffee with a multi colored appearance resembling that of roast and ground coffee is then produced by mixing the separately freeze dried coffees. It is generally desirable to reduce the size of the freeze dried coffee to approximately the size of roast and ground coffee particles, as by grinding, and the mixing is conveniently carried out in the same step. The two freeze dried coffees may be fed concurrently to a grinder which grinder will both reduce the size to particles and provide a uniform mixture of atmospherically extracted and hydrolysis extracted freeze dried coffee particles.Of course, it is possible to separately grind the coffees and subsequently produce the uniform mixture, as in a ribbon blender but this involves an extra step and is not as convenient. Another embodiment of the present invention involves layered freezing of the two coffee extracts followed by grinding and freeze drying. According to this embodiment, one of the extracts, either the atmospheric extract or hydrolysis extract, is frozen as on a continuous, moving metal belt hereinbefore described. Once said extract is frozen, the second extract is placed as a layer thereon whereby it is frozen. It is preferred to freeze the hydrolysis extract as the first layer and to do so rapidly in order to further lighten the color of the hydrolysis solids. The layered, frozen extract is ground, as in a hammer mill, in order to reduce it to particle size as well as provide a uniform mixture of frozen atmospheric extract and hydrolysis extract particles. The ground, frozen coffee extract particles are then dried according to a technique such as disclosed inU.S. Pat. No. 3,365,806 to Pfluger et al. for example, whereby a freeze dried coffee with a multi colored appearance resembling that of roast and ground coffee is produced. At least two freeze dried coffee particle colorations, common to all embodiments, are produced by the present invention. As hereinbefore described, freeze dried coffee made from atmospheric extract is very dark colored whereas hydrolysis freeze dried coffee is relatively light colored. The present invention, by treating the two extracts differently at least through the layered freezing step, provides the two different colored freeze dried coffees. A third particle coloration is provided by the.embodiment calling for the layered freezing of the two coffee extracts.Particles obtained exclusively from the atmospheric extract portion will be darkcolored, particles obtained solely from the hydrolysis extract portion will be light colored and, particles obtained from the boundary region of the two layers will have both dark colored and light colored faces, providing the third particle coloration. For each of the embodiments of the present invention, the most desirable multi colored appearance is achieved by producing a freeze dried coffee comprised of between 40 and 50 by weight atmospheric coffee solids and between 50 and 60 by weight hydrolysis solids. Such a freeze dried coffee has a sufficient distribution of the different particle colorations to have an appearance resembling that of roast and ground coffee.Best Mode For Carrying Out The Invention The following example illustrates certain aspects of the present invention. The example is not intended to limit the invention beyond what is claimed below. Example 1. Approximately 9.0 kg of roast and ground coffee was charged to an elongated percolator column. 2. The coffee was atmospherically extracted by passing up flow through the coffee at a temperature of 93 C. The resulting approximately 9.0 kg of atmospheric extract had a concentration of about 22 by weight atmospheric coffee solids. 3. The same roast and ground coffee was then extracted for hydrolysis solids by passing about 9.0 kg of water up flow through the coffee at a temperature above 1500C. The resulting approximately 9.0 kg of hydrolysis extract had a concentration of about 8.7 by weight hydrolysis coffee solids. 4. Both coffee extracts were adjusted to a solids concentration of 25 by weight solids. 5. Three frozen extract samples were produced by placing the extract as a thin layer in a pan maintained at 100C. All three of the samples were frozen at the same conditions. a a sample of atmospheric extract was frozen. b a sample of hydrolysis extract was frozen. c a layer of atmospheric extract was frozen and a layer of hydrolysis extract was then frozen by placing it on the frozen atmospheric extract. The weights of atmospheric extract and hydrolysis extract were the same. 6. The three frozen extract samples were freeze dried in a laboratory freeze dryer maintained at 200 micron pressure and a temperature of 25 C for a period of 20 hours. 7. The three freeze dried coffee samples were reduced in size by forcing the freeze dried coffee through an 8 mesh screen U.S. Standard Sieve Screen .The size reduced freeze dried coffee produced from the layered extract was shaken to distribute the different colored particles evenly. 8. The color of the freeze dried coffee samples was measured according to a scale well known in the art wherein the amount of light reflected by a given sample is compared to the amount reflected by an established standard. A lower color unit number indicated a darker product. This method of measurement was inappropriate for the multi colored freeze dried coffee sample which was characterized visually. The freeze dried coffee made from the atmospheric extract had a color of 22 color units compared a color of 42 color units for the freezedried coffee prepared from the hydrolysis extract.This demonstrates that atmospheric extract produces a substantially darker freeze dried coffee as compared to the hydrolysis extract. The freeze dried coffee made from the layered frozen extract was characterized as having the multi colored appearance resembling that of roast and ground coffee.
