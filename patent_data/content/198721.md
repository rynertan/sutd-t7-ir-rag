## Description
This invention relates to a method for producing a highly selective reforming catalyst which comprises platinum, a large pore zeolite support, and at least one promoter metal selected from iron, cobalt and titanium, as well as to the reforming process itself. Catalytic reforming is a well known process that is used to raise the octane rating of a naphtha. The reactions that occur during reforming include dehydrogenation of cyclohexanes, dehydroisomerization of alkyl cyclopentanes, dehydrocyclization of acyclic hydrocarbons, dealkylation of alkylbenzenes, isomerization of paraffins, and hydrocracking of praffins. The hydrocracking reaction should be suppressed because that reaction lowers the yield of hydrogen and lowers the yield of liquid products. Reforming catalysts must be selective for dehydrocyclization in order to produce high yields of liquid product and low yields of light gases. These catalysts should possess good activity so that low temperatures can be used in the reformer. Whilst most reforming catalysts contain platinum on an alumina support, large pore zeolites have been proposed as catalyst supports. These large pore zeolites have pores large enough for hydrocarbons in the gasoline boiling range to pass through. According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of producing a dehydrocyclisation catalyst comprising a type L zeolite containing platinum metal and at least one promoter metal selected from iron, cobalt and titanium, characterised in that said method includes the step of incorporating the promoter in an oxidised state in an amount sufficient to give a platinum to promoter metal mole ratio in the catalyst of 1.6 1 or less than 1.6 1. According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a catalytic reforming process comprising the stop of contacting a naphtha, at a temperature of from 430 C to 550 C, a pressure of from 1 atmosphere to 500 psig 35 bar , a liquid hourly space velocity of 0.1hr ¹ to 10hr ¹ and an H₂ HC ratio of from 1 1 to 20 1, with a dehydrocyclisation catalyst prepared by a method in accordance with the first aspect of this invention. It has been found that the presence of a promoter, in particular iron, cobalt, or titanium, in a L zeolite supported platinum catalyst has a major promoting effect on the aromatization activity of that catalyst. As used herein, the term promoter means a metal that enhances the dehydrocyclization activity of a catalyst. The function of the promoter is to maintain the high initial activity of the noble metal catalyst. This promoter can be one of iron, cobalt, or titanium, preferably iron. A common characteristic of promoter metals is that they all have either d or f valence electrons. The absolute level of promoter is important for making a highly selective reforming catalyst. With a high ratio of platinum promoter, the original, highly active, well dispersed, platinum catalyst rapidly loses activity at reforming temperatures. Initial activity is best maintained when the platinum promoter ratio is about one or less. On the other hand, it is well known that transition metals promote the undesired hydrocarbon cracking reactions. Therefore, one should avoid excess levels of these metals. Several methods exist for adding a promoter to a zeolitic reforming catalyst. In a preferred embodiment, the promoter is added during synthesis of the zeolite. In other embodiments, the promoter can be added after synthesis, either by impregnation or by ion exchange. However introduced, the promoter must be in an oxidized state i.e. the metal must have a positive charge prior to the addition of the Group VIII metal. The large pore zeolite for use in the invention is a type L zeolite. Type L zeolites are synthetic zeolites. A theoretical formula is M The real formula may vary without changing the crystalline structure for example, the mole ratio of silicon to aluminium Si Al may vary from 1.0 to 3.5. One method of forming the desired catalyst is by first forming a type L zeolite by combining an aqueous solution Of potassium hydroxide, aluminium hydroxide, and ferric nitrate with an aqueous solution of silica to firm a thickening gel in a mother liquor heating the thickening gel, for example in an autoclave at about 302 F 150 C for about 72 hours, to form a type L zeolite cooling the gel containing the type L zeolite decanting the mother liquor from the gel filtering the type L zeolite from the gel washing the filtered type L zeolite, for example three times in a ten fold excess of water, so that the pH of the wash is about 10.5 and drying the washed type L zeolite, for example at about 250 F 121 C for 16 hours. Then the catalyst is formed by adding Platinum to the dried type L zeolite, preferably by pore fill impregnation with an aqueous solution of either Pt NH₃ ₄ NO₃ ₂, or pt NH₃ ₄Cl₂ to form a catalyst drying the catalyst and calcining the dried catalyst. An inorganic oxide can be used as a binder for the large pore zeolite This binder can be either natural, synthetically produced, or a combination of the two. preferred loadings of inorganic oxide binders are from 5 to 50 of the weight of the catalyst. Useful binders include silica, alumina, aluminosilicates and clays. The catalyst of the invention can be used to reform a naphtha that is substantially free of sulfur, nitrogen, metals, and other known catalyst poisons. The poisons can be removed first by using conventional hydrofining techniques, then by using sorbents to remove the remaining poisons. Specifically, sulfur should normally be reduced to below 100 ppb in the feed. The naphtha may be contacted with the catalyst in either a fixed bed system, a moving bed system, a fluidized system, or a batch system. The pressure is generally from 1 atmosphere to 500 psig 35 bar . The preferred temperature is from 430 C to 550 C. The liquid hourly space velocity LHSV is preferably from 0.1 hr ¹ to 10 hr ¹. Enough hydrogen is generally used to ensure an H₂ HC ratio of from 1 1 to 20 1. The following Examples are given for informative purposes. A 90 C solution was formed containing 102 grams KOH, 200 grams water, 47 grams Al OH ₃, and a prescribed amount of either Fe NO₃ ₃.9H₂O or K₃Fe CN ₆. This solution was combined with a solution of 600 grams HS 30 Ludox SiO₂ and 240 grams water. After shaking the combined solution in a Teflon polytetrafluoroethylene bottle for three minutes, the solution became a thickening gel. This thickening gel was heated in an autoclave at 25 F 13,9 C hr, to 302 F 150 C and held at 302 F 150 C for 72 hours to form a crystalline material. When ferric nitrate was used, an orange brown precipitate formed before heating, but when potassium ferric cyanide was used, the solution was yellow. However, in each case after crystallization, the zeolite was white and the supernate was colorless. After the solution was cooled, the mother liquor was decanted the solid was filtered, washed three times in a ten fold excess of water so that the pH of the wash was about 10.5, and dried. In each case, about 170 grams of zeolite was obtained and all of the added iron hid been incorporated in the zeolite. X ray diffraction measurements showed that all samples were 100 L zeolite. Analyses of the products are given in Table I. It appears that adding small amounts of iron did not affect the synthesis since, save for iron, the elemental analyses, X ray diffraction data, and scanning electromicrographs showed that all of these materials were alike. The presence of iron and titanium impurities in the synthesis materials can also result in the incorporation of the active promoter metal in the zeolite support. In another preparation, L zeolite was synthesized by dissolving 127.8 grams KOH in 127.8 grams of water, followed by the addition of 60.2 grams of Al₂O₃ 3H₂O. This was boiled until everything dissolved. The solution was cooled to 50 C, diluted with 690.5 grams of water, and mixed. Then, 237.6 grass of Hi Sil 233 88 SiO₂ was added to the mixture and the mixture was homogenized. When the mixture was heated in an autoclave at 150 C for about 40 hours, L zeolite was produced. Elemental analysis of the product showed it to contain SiO₂ 67.4 Al₂O₃ 17.2 K₂O 17.6 Fe 1300 ppm Ti 520 ppm all concentrations are on a weight basis . Platinum was added to the type L zeolite by pore fill impregnation with on aqueous solution of Pt NH₃ ₄ NO₃ ₂. After sitting for two hours in a closed bottle, the material was dried at 250 F 121 C for 16 hours and was calcined at 500 F 260 C for three hours. The platinum type L zeolite catalysts were tested for aromatization activity by loading the catalysts as 24 to 80 mesh granules in the middle of a 1 4 inch 6.4 mm stainless steel reactor. The catalyst sample was surrounded by alundum. The catalyst was reduced in one atmosphere hydrogen 400 500 ml minute and heated to operating temperature with 30 and 10 minute stops at 400 F 204 C and 700 F 371 C , respectively. The operating conditions were a temperature of 920 F 493 C , a pressure of 100 psig 7 bar , and an H₂ HC ratio of 6 1. The mount of catalyst used and the space velocity were adjusted so that the ratio of feed rate to loaded platinum was kept constant e.g., one gram of a 1 platinum type L zeolite catalyst would be compared to 0.5 grams of a 2 platinum type L zeolite at the same feed rate . The catalysts were tested with a C₆ C₇ naphtha since these light hydrocarbons are difficult to aromatize with conventional reforming catalysts. This feed consisted of 80v paraffins, 16.2v naphthenes, and 3.5v aromatics. The boiling range D86 distillation for the naphtha feedstock was 145 F 63 C initial point, 170 F 77 C at 10 distilled, 180 F 82 C at 30 distilled, 192 F 89 C at 50 distilled, 218 F 103 C at 80 distilled, 233 F 112 C at 90 distilled and 277 F 136 C at end point. The results, taken after 20 hours on stream, are given in Table II. The data in Table II show that the platinum to promoter metal mole ratio must be below 10 1 in order to have a conversion of more than 50 . A series of catalysts was prepared wherein the principal promoter metal was other than iron. The same L zeolite Synthesis described in samples 1 through 6 of Example I was used and in each case the promoter metal was introduced as the nitrate salt. Platinum was added in the manner described previously to the level of 0.8 wt. . Catalyst testing was carried out in the same way as in Example I. The levels of promoter metals in each catalyst and the corresponding catalytic test results are shown in Table III. A common characteristic of each of the promoter metals which was found to be effective was the presence of d or f valence electrons. The function of the promoter is to maintain the high initial activity of the noble metal catalyst. With a low ratio of platinum promoter, the original, highly active, well dispersed, platinum catalyst rapidly loses activity at reforming temperatures. Initial activity is best maintained when the platinum promoter ratio is about one or less. This is illustrated by the results of the dehydrocyclization tests shown in Table IV. In this test the feed was normal hexane, the pressure was one atmosphere, the temperature was 820 F 438 C , and the hydrogen hydrocarbon ratio was 6. All of the catalysts consisted of L zeolite loaded with 0.8 wt. platinum and the indicated level of promoter. The L zeolite supports for these catalysts were made as described in Example I with various amounts of nitrate salts added to the synthesis.
