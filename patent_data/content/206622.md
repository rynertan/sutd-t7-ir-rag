# Ceramic metal composite body.

## Abstract
A ceramic metal composite body comprises a ceramic member 13 with a projection 14 and a metallic member with a recess 15 or through hole, joined together by fitting the projection into the recess or through hole. Tight fitting and good torsional test results are obtained when the difference between the outer diameter of the projection 14 of the ceramic member and the inner diameter of the recess 15 or through hole of the metallic member after the projection is extracted from the recess or through hole is not less than 0.2 of the outer diameter of the projection of the ceramic member after extraction. Preferably the outer diameter of the projection 14 is not more than 90 of the outer diameter of the portion of the metallic member in which the recess or through hole is formed.
