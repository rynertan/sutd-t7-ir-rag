# An electrical connector assembly having an anti decoupling device.

## Abstract
A latch member 46 pivotally disposed externally of a coupling nut 40 rotatably mounted on one shell 10 for threadably connecting to another shell 20 , the latch member and having an end portion 50 thereof extending forwardly of the coupling nut, mating tapered surfaces 55, 30 formed on an inner face 55 of the latch member and annularly around the other shell and longitudinally and radially extending splines 39, 59 disposed around the mating tapered surfaces and con figured to slidably interengage to prevent and or resist un coupling rotation, the latch member 46 pivoting and biasing the splines into engagement and being adapted to provide a manual release machanism to laterally disengage the splines. The splines are so positioned by the latch member as to be nor mally out of engagement until full mating of the shells is achieved assembly.
