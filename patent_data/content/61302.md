# COIN DISCRIMINATION

## Abstract
Discrimination between two coin denomination Xp, Yp of equal diameter but different thicknesses, is made in a coin sorter by sweeping the coins round an annular plate 10 in abutment with the inner edge 13 of an upstanding rim 11 which in the region of a sizing aperture 143 for receiving the thinner denomination Xp is undercut to admit coins of that denomination, but not of the other, thicker denomination Yp , into abutment with an outer auxiliary edge 17 such that only coins of the thinner denomination Xp will be accepted within the diametral threshold set for that aperture 143 from the auxiliary edge 17 . The thicker coins Yp , because they abut the undercut edge 13 , lie outside this threshold but are accepted within the same threshold set from that edge 13 at the next aperture 144 . In another sorter coins are tipped from an inclined and slotted shoulder 30 by deflectors 35 to 37 depending upon diametral thresholds set from the top 38 of the shoulder 30 or the bottom 40 of the slot 39 according to coin thickness, whereas in other apparatus discrimination is made photoelectroni cally in response to coins which run along different rails 60, 61 according to their thicknesses or other characteristics .
