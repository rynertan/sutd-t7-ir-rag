# Process for the purification of 2 pyrrolidone.

## Abstract
In a distillation process pyrrolidone obtained from suc cinonitrile is purified by treating the impure liquid pyrrolidone with a strong base, fractionally distilling this product to yield, as distillate, polymerization grade pyrrolidone, mixing the 2 pyrrolidone containing residue from the fractional distilla tion with water and an acid, and extracting purified pyr rolidone from the water acid mixture. The latter purified pyr rolidone product is suitable for recycling to the pyrrolidone synthesis or to make other products.
