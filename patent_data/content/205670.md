## Description
Refrigerating or heat pump system. The invention relates to a refrigerating or heat puK,p system comprising an evaporator, a compressor, a condensor, and a throttle means, the compressor comprising an electric motor and a reciprocating pump, which pump comprises a cylinder in which a piston is reciprocated by the electric motor to work on a compression space above the piston, which campressor has an inlet and an outlet, which are connected to the evaporator and to the condensor, respectively by means of pipes, and further comprising a suction part and a bypass by means of which the suction part can be made to communicate with the coupression space by controlling a valve member in the bypass. Most refrigerating or heat pump systems are controlled through on off control of the compressor. To improve the efficiency of such a system through continuous operation, i.e. continuously operating the compressor, various control possibilities are known. An example of such a possibility is the use of speed control of the electric motor of the compressor. This control method is satisfactory but comparatively expensive. Another known control method utilizes a plurality of small compressor units, one or more compressors being rendered inoperative depending on the required capacity. This control method is economic only if the capacity of the system is sufficiently large.Another kncwn possibility is suction gas control, the volute of the gas taken in being reduced by keeping the suction valve open during the compression stroke or allowing a specific amount of gas to flow back from the cylinder via a bypass depending on the required capacity. The invention relates to a system controlled in conformity with the last mentioned method. It is known to open or close a connection between the cylinder space and the suction part by means of a valve. The invention aims at improving the efficiency of the system by means of a simple and cheap control mechanism. According to the invention the system is characterized in that the valve member is controlled electromagnetically and the system corprisss a control mechanism which reduces the power of the electric motor in an efficient manner when the bypass is opened. SLiction gas control reduces the refrigerant mass being circulated, so that the evaporator temperature increases and the condensor temperature decreases, thereby reducing the work of caxpression. On the average cold is now produced at a higher temperature than in an on off controlled system. In other words, in the system according to the invention cold is produced with a higher efficiency. However, during the period in which bypass channel is open the mass to be circulated by the carpressor is smaller, so that the torque to be delivered by the electric motor is reduced and the efficiency decreases. Therefore, in order to maintain the efficiency of the electric motor at the same level, the power is reduced in an efficient manner during said period.To produce the same amount of cold as in an on off controlled system, the combined control of the system in accordance with the invention results in a net reduction in power consuription of approximately 10 . An on off controlled system is to be understood to mean as a system in which during the of f period the condensor is disconnected fram the evaporator. During the off period the connection between the connsor and the evaporator should remain open for example if the throttle means is a capillary , the power saved is even higher than the above 10 , namely of the order of 20 . A preferred embodiment is characterized in that the suction part comprises a damper, a suction duct and a suction chaser, the bypass is situated between the suction duct and the carpression space, and the valve member is coupled to the core of an electromagnet, which valve mebeer opens the connecting duct when the electromagnet is energized and closes said duct by means of a return spring when said electromagnet is not energized.This has the advantage that in the event of failure of the control irisharim, due to whatever cause, the return spring ensures that the valve erber is set to the position in which the carpressor operates at the maxievlm capacity, that the system reverts to normal on off control. Another preferred emhodiment is characterized in that the cylinder is formed with a bore in which the valve 36er is movable and which intersects said bypass duct, which valve member has a bore such that, upon energization of the electromagnet, this bore is situated in line with the bypass. The bore is situated at a small distance from the cylinder wall, in such a way that in the closed situation the additional clearance volume in the carpression space, i.e. the volume in the bypass between the valve member and the conpression space, is minimal.This has the advantage that during closure of the bypass the compression pressure exists no force on the valve member in its direction of movement. The bypass can be closed by changing the position of the valve member in the bore, either by sliding it in the said direction of the bore or by rotating it through 9 30 in the bore. As there is hardly any pressure differential across the valve member, the leakage path need not be exceptionally large. The system efficiency is improved because the flow resistance of the throttle means is increased when the bypass is opened. An embodiment of the invention will now be described in more detail, by way of example, with reference to the drawings. Fig. 1 shows the refrigerating or heat pump system. Fig. 2 is a partly sectional view of the compressor. Fig. 3 is a cross sectional view of the campressor taken on the line III III in Fig. 2. Fig. 4 shows efficiency torque curves of the electric motor. Fig. 5 shows the electric circuit of the system. Fig. 6 illustrates the thermal behaviour of the evaporator and the condensor. Fig. 7 shows a refrigerating system employing a capillary throttle resistance control. The system carprises an evaporator 1, a compressor 2, a condensor 3, and a throttle valve4, which are interconnected by pipes to form a closed circuit. The carpressor is mounted in a hermetically sealed housing 5, which also accommodates an electric motor 6 and a reciprocating pump 7. The reciprocating pump comprises a cylinder 8 in which a piston 9 is reciprocated by the electric motor, a cover 10, and a valve plate 11 arranged between the cover and the cylinder. The valve plate is formed with an inlet port 12 with an inlet valve 13 and an outlet port 14 with an outlet valve 15. The housing 5 of the compressor has an inlet 16 and an outlet 17 which are connected to the evaporator 1 and the condensor 3, respectively by means of pipes. Via the suction part comprising a suction damper 18, a suction duct 19 and a suction chamber 20 the refrigerant gas is drawn into the compression space 21 after which it is compressed and forced into the compression chamber and the campression damper 23 via the outlet port 14 subsequently, the gas is fed to the condensor via the outlet 17. In accordance with the invention the system is controlled by providing the compressor with a bypass duct 24 between the compression duct space 21 and the suction 19. Alternatively, this bypass may be situated between the compression space and the suction dapper 18 or between the compression space and the suction chamfer 20. The cylinder housing 8 is formed with a bore 25 in which a valve member 26 is slidable. The bore 25 intersects the bypass 24. The valve member 26 is integral with the movable core 27 of an electromagnet 28. The core 27 is surrounded by a coil 29 which is included in an electrical control loop of the system.Further, the electromagnet is provided with a return spring 30. The pinshaped valve member 26 is formed with a bore 31 which, depending on the position of the valve member, can be positioned in line or not in line with the bypass duct 24 to open or close the bypass. In the position shown in Fig. 3 the elecrorragnet 26 is energized and the bore 31 is disposed in line with the bypass duct 24. During the upward movement of the piston from the lOwer dead centre this results in gas being forced back to the suction part 18 19 20 via the bypass 24. This continues until the piston has passed the opening of the bypass 24 in the cylinder wall. The residual gas in the carpression space 21 is then compressed to the condensor pressure.The compressor then operates at a reduced capacity.This capacity depends on the level of the opening of the bypass 24 in the cylinder 8. Advantageously, in this position the carpression pressure acts on the wall of the bore 31, so that no resultant forces act on the valve member and have to be compensated by the electromagnet. When the electrtragnet is not energized the return spring 30 urges the valve member upwards, thereby closing the bypass duct. In this position the force exerted on the valve member by the compression pressure d does s not act in the direction of movement, i.e. not on the spring, so that no fatique problems will occur. In the closed position the compressor operates at rnaxiirurrLcapacity Fig. 2 . The system in accordance with the invention also comprises a control mechanism which reduces the power of the electric motor in an efficient manner when the bypass 24 is connected. Fig. 4 shows two efficiency torque curves of the electric motor. In curve I the motor power is higher than in curve II. During the period in which the osmpressor operates with a closed bypass the operating range of the electric motor is situated between points A and B of curve I. If the bypass 24 between the pipe 19 and the carpression space 21 is now opened, the torque T will decrease, and hence the efficiency will decrease. The electric motor then operates for example between points C and D.The efficiency can be increased by reducing, for example, the voltage. The electric motor then operates, for example, in the range E F of curve II, in which the efficiency is high. An efficient reduction of the power for torque control is preferably effected by means of a loss free power controller. For example, a transformer may be used in order to reduce the voltage. However, a transformer is expensive. The e power controller 40 shown in Fig. 5, which is also loss free, is cheaper. Depending on the position of the switch S1 the network comprising two different resistors R1 and R2 R1 R2 , a capacitor C, a diac D, a triac T and a voltage dependent resistor VDR controls the phase angle of the mains sinewave. The setting of the switch S1 is governed by a variable thermostat 41. At a inaxirrum evaporator temperature for example 3 C the switch S1 is set to the right hand position full power and at a variable minimum evaporator temperature for example 16 to 240C to the left hand position reduced power .If the compressor operates at full power S1 in the right hand position switch S2 is open and the coil 29 of the electromagnet 28 for the actuation of the valve member 26 is not energized. However, in the case of reduced compressor power switch S2 is closed and the electromagnet is energized, so that the valve member 26 opens the bypass duct 24 between the suction duct 19 and the compression space 21. Fig. 6 illustrates the thermal behaviour of the evaporator and the condensor, both for a known on off control and for the two position control in accordance with the invention. The plotted temperatures have been measured on the refrigerant side. The broken line curves relate to the on off control and the solid curves relate to the control in accordance with the invention. In the case of on off control the condensor temperature increases from 250C ambient temperature to approximately 50 C a1 during the on period of the compressor, while in the same period the evaporator temperature decreases from 9 0C refrigerator temperature to 240C bl . In the subsequent off period the condensor temperature again decreases to approximately 250C a2 and the evaporator temperature rises to approximately 90C b2 .This control gives rise to a temperature fluctuation c of approximately 80C in, for example, the refrigerating compartment air of a refrigerator. In the case of the novel two position control the condensor temperature increases from approximately 320C to approximately 450C dl during the short period of full compressor capacity, the evaporator temperature decreasing from 5 C to 20 C eel in the same period.In The next long period with reduced compressor capacity, i.e. when the bypass between the carpression space and the suction duct is open and the drive voltage has been reduced, the condensor temperature decreases to approximately 320C d2 and the evaporator temperature increases to approximately to 50C e2 . Coesequently, the temperature fluctuations of the evaporator and the condensor are reduced substantially if the novel control method is employed. As a result of this, the temperature fluctuation f in, for example, the refrigerating carparment air of a refrigerator is also substantially smaller approxinnately 3 C . Since the mass flow of the refrigerant is smaller in the period when the bypass 24 is open the resistance of the throttle means 4 should be higher in order to maintain the pressure differential. For a refrigerating system in which the throttle means is a capillary, Fig. 7 shows an example of how the flow resistance can be switched to either of two valves. In the circuit two capillaries 4a and 4b are arranged in series, the capillary 4a being bypassed by opening the valve 42 when the carpres sor operates at full power. In the case of reduced operation the valve is closed and the two capillaries are operative. Preferably, the valve 42 is operated electromagnetically. In Fig. 5 the location of the electroeagnetic coil 33 in the circuit is indicated by a broken lineIn the reduced mode the switch S3 is closed, coil 43 of the electromagnet is energized, and the valve 42 is closed. Beat pumps generally employ a bemperature oontrolled expansion valve. Such an expansion valve is opened automatically to the correct extent in order to maintain the pressure differential.
