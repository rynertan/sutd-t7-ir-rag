# Multi layered diaphragm for electrolysis.

## Abstract
A multi layer diaphragm for electrolysis, which compris es a porous layer of a fluorine containing polymer having a pore diameter of from 0.05 to 10µm, a porosity of from 30 to 95 and a thickness of from 30 to 450 µm and with its interior and anode side surface being hydrophilic, and an ion exchange resin layer supported on the cathode side thereof and having a thickness thinner than the porous layer but of at least 5 µm and an ion exchange capacity of from 0.5 to 2.0 meg g dry resin, the total thickness being from 35 to 500 µm.
