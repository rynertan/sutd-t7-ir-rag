# Centerfold forming apparatus for a disk envelope.

## Abstract
Centerfold forming apparatus for making an envelope for a plastic disk from a prepunched, flexible, plastic blank having two sections connected at the heads thereof and containing a drive hole at the same location in each section the flexible plastic material blank 10 is held against two outward surfaces 32,33 of a first and second folding plate 21,23 that are pivoted in the middle 28 so that the plates 21, 23 are driven in an arcuate path until said outward surfaces 32,33 are positioned in vertical planes facing each other the drive holes in each section of the flexible blank are fitted over respective hubs 35,35 located in the same location in said surface 32,33 of each first and second folding plate 21,23 a mandrel 34 which is extendable vertically and has an edge thereof in the extended position pressing against the blank 10 in the area between the first and second plates pulling the drive holes in the blank taut on said hubs 35,35 thereby locating the centerline of said blank drive means moving the folding plates 21,23 from the horizontal to the vertical facing position causing said blank 10 to bend along the pressing edge of said mandrel 34 forming the centerfold heating means are provided for heating the centerfold to a predetermined temperature to anneal the material thereby reducing internal stresses therein.
