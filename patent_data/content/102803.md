# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO POST MOUNTS AND OR METHODS OF MOUNTING POSTS

## Abstract
A post mount assembly 5, 30 is described for mounting a post 8, 41 , on a mounting base 6, 30 . The link is provided by a resilient connector 7, 31 which, when the post 8, 41 is subjected to a displacing force that would normally damage the post 8, 41 , deforms to allow the post 8, 41 to fall clear of the base 6, 30 . The connector 7, 31 thereafter recovers to allow the post 8, 41 to be remounted on the base 6, 30 .
