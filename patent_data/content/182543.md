## Description
VINYL MONOMER COMPOSITIONS This invention is concerned with vinyl monomer compositions especially, though not exclusively, to vinyl monomer compositions suitable for use as impregnants or sealers for substrates, for example concrete, and as binders for polymer concrete11 coating or patching compositions. Known vinyl monomer compositions, for example, methyl methacrylate compositions are polymerized in situ to form protective coatings. Typically, before application of the monomer composition, the substrate is pretreated to enhance penetration of monomer into the substrate, the monomer being cured in a subsequent polymerization step. Concrete treated in this manner may be more resistant to abrasion and chemical spills than untreated concrete. Vinyl monomer may be polymerized in bulk by free radical polymerization initiated by high energy radiation, particle beams or chemical sources of free radicals such as peroxides and hydroperoxides. However free radical polymerization of vinyl monomer may be retarded by molecular oxygen, which may be particularly troublesome in surface coating and impregnant compositions, such as those used in protecting concrete surfaces. In the special case of compositions based on methyl methacrylate, the lack of surface cure is not particularly disadvantageous, methyl methacrylate has significant vapor pressure and uncured monomer on the surface of an otherwise polymerized composition evaporates relatively quickly, exposing the hard polymeric surface beneath. Alternatively, when the composition contains less volatile vinyl monomer, the surface of the composition may be very slow to cure because of oxygen retardation.Although this results in a surface with undesirable properties such as tack and persistent residual odor, the fully cured compositions may be otherwise desirable because of, for example, enhanced chemical resistance, greater safety and or low odor. Under cured oligomeric material on the surface may increase the water sensitivity. A variety of techniques have been used in an attempt to solve the problem presented by retardation of polymerization by oxygen. In one particular example, a polyvalent metal salt such as zinc naphthenate may be included in the coating or impregnant composition in order to catalyze the oxidative cure of the residual uncured monomer. Driers such as zinc naphthenate are commonly used to promote through drying of alkyd paints. In another example, in a manufacturing context, articles coated with vinyl monomer composition can be cured under a blanket of nitrogen or other inert gas. In a further example, a second coating of a material such as paraffin can be used to reduce oxygen penetration at the surface of the applied composition. The paraffin can be included in the composition to yield a surface film on application or a film of paraffin can be applied over the initial coating film.None of these solutions has been totally satisfactory, and there remains a significant need for vinyl monomer compositions which contain low volatility vinyl monomers which rapidly develop surface cure. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a vinyl monomer composition comprises at least one low volatility vinyl monomer having dispersed therein diolefin rubber which is insoluble in said vinyl monomer, and at least one polyvalent metal catalyst. Vinyl monomer compositions which contain diolefin rubber dispersed therein cure significantly more quickly than similar compositions which do not contain the dispersed diolefin rubber. Further, compositions of this invention containing diolefin rubber particles show an accelerated surface cure in comparison with analogous compositions which have nonolefin rubber polymeric particles dispersed instead of the olefin rubber particles. The acceleration of the surface cure of the vinyl monomer by the diolefin rubber is unexpected and the mechanism of acceleration is unknown. The compositions of this invention have the advantage of yielding surface coatings which show reduced tack compared with prior art compositions. Another advantage is that the compositions of this invention may be formulated using a high proportion of low volatility monomer to achieve a relatively tack free surface than prior art compositions.Still another advantage lies in the improved surface physical properties shown by the compositions of this invention in comparison with prior art compositions. These improved surface physical properties are reflected, for example, in the resistance to chalking and color fading shown by surfaces coated with compositions of this invention. Another advantage is that thinner coatings of the compositions of this invention can be used to achieve the same level of performance as that of prior art compositions. The diolefin rubber is preferably present in the composition in the form of dispersed particles. The diolefin rubber may be in the form of a homopolymer of diolefin monomer or as a copolymer of diolefin monomers.Alternatively, copolymers of diolefin monomer s and copolymerizable non diolefin monomer s may be empoloyed.Examples of diolefin monomers which may be used either alone or in combination with at least one other diolefin monomer and or non diolefin monomer s to prepare diolefin polymer are 1,3 butadiene, 2 chloro 1,3 butadiene, 2,3 dichloro 1,3butadiene, 2 cyano 1,3 butadiene 1,2,3,4tetrachlorobutadiene, isoprene, 1,4 hexadiene and or dicyclopentediene. Diolefin rubber particles are preferably polymerized from monomer comprising at least 60 percent by weight diolefin monomer, said monomer preferably being selected from any one or more of 1,3 butadiene, 2 chloro l, 3 butadiene, 2,3 dichloro 1,3 butadiene, 2 cyano 1,3 butadiene, 1,2,3,4 tetrachlorobutadiene, isoprene, 1,4 hexadiene and or dicyclopentadiene.Homo and copolymers polymerized from at least 50 by weight o√ß total monomer of 1,3 butadiene monomer are preferred. The diolefin rubber particles may be prepared by emulsion or suspension polymerization, as is conventional in the rubber art. In addition, natural rubber latex may be used.Diolefin rubber particles which are insoluble yet swellable in the vinyl monomer are preferred. Thus, internally crosslinked diolefin rubber particles are preferred. The diolefin rubber particles must also be dispersible in the vinyl monomer. Polymer dispersion aids may be employed to disperse the diolefin rubber particles in the vinyl monomer.The diolefin rubber particles may be prepared in at least two stages and preferably at least the initial stage is of diolefin rubber formed by emulsion polymerization. It is preferred that the second and or later stages contain at least a portion of polymeric material dispersing aids which swells and or dissolves in the vinyl monomer employed in the composition of this invention. The dispersing aids used in the second and or later stages may be formed, by for example emulsion polymerization, in the presence of the diolefin rubber formed in the earlier stage. For example, when the vinyl monomer composition contains dicyclopentenyloxyethyl methacrylate, methyl methacrylate monomer may be used in the preparation of the second stage of the diolefin rubber particles. The second and or later stages may be graft polymerized to the first. Especially preferred are diolefin rubber particles disclosed in U.S.patents 3,671,610, 3,775,514 and 3,899,547. These patents disclose processes for preparing butadiene styrene methyl methacrylate copolymers by graft polymerizing, on crosslinked butadiene or polybutadiene styrene copolymer latex, styrene, methyl methacrylate and copolymerizable crosslinking agent. Other diolefin rubbers prepared by emulsion or suspension polymerization, such as chloroprene nitrile butadiene rubber, and styrene butadiene rubber, may also be modified by graft polymerization to yield diolefin rubber particles which are dispersible in the vinyl monomer compositions of this invention. It is believed that such modified diolefin rubber particles have a core shell structure, and that the shells of these particles, swell and or partially dissolve in the vinyl monomer, thereby promoting dispersion of the particles in the monomer.However, this invention is not limited by the proffered explanation of the dispersion of these particles, and further, any means of dispersing diolefin rubber particles in the monomer may be used to prepare the compositions of this invention. Preferred monomers which may be polymerized to form the second and or later stages may include one or more of styrene, methyl methacrylate, and or C2 C8 alkyl acrylate. It is preferred that the ratio of the weight of diolefin monomer polymerized to yield the diolefin rubber particles to the total weight of monomer polymerized to yield these particles be at least 0.4 1. The second and or later stages include from 0.01 to 5 percent by weight of total monomer which is polymerized to form the second and or later stages of divinyl crosslinking agent.The divinyl crosslinking agent may be selected from one or more of divinyl benzene, diethylene glycol dimethacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, tetramethylene glycol dimethacrylate, polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate, polypropylene glcyol dimethacrylate and or 1,3 butylene glycol dimethacrylate. It is preferred that the weight ratio of the diolefin rubber to the vinyl monomer be from 1 20 to 1 1. It is especially preferred that this weight ratio be from 1 9 to 1 4. Whilst the vinyl monomer with which the diolefin rubber is dispersed may consist of single vinyl monomer species, the vinyl monomer may also be made up of a mixture of vinyl monomer species. By vinyl monomer species we mean an alpha, beta ethylenically unsaturated monomer species. The monomer species may have only one site of alpha, beta ethylenic unsaturation, or it may have two or more such sites. Low volatility vinyl monomer species are essential, but the vinyl monomer composition may also contain other more volatile vinyl monomer species, such as methyl methacrylate. By low volatility vinyl monomer species we mean an alpha, beta ethylenically unsaturated monomer species having a partial pressure of no greater than 1 mm of Hg at 450C.Examples of low volatility vinyl monomer species are t butyl styrene, which has a partial pressure of 1 mm at 470C, and 2 ethylhexyl acrylate, which has a partial pressure of 1 mm at 50 C. In addition to the diolefin rubber and low volatility vinyl monomer, compositions of the present invention must also contain at least one polyvalent metal catalyst to promote the oxidative cure of the vinyl monomer. Polyvalent metal oxidative cure catalysts are well known in the coatings art. The polyvalent metal oxidative cure catalyst may be any salt or complex of a polyvalent metal ion that catalyzes the oxidative curing of drying oils and, when added to oil based varnishes and paints, hastens the drying or curing thereof. These metal salts or complexes are also known, in the art, as siccatives or driers . The polyvalent metal salts of aliphatic acids, for example the butyrate, pentanoate, hexanoate, and especially the salts of aliphatic acids having from 8 to 30 carbon atoms or of naphthenic acids that provide solubility in the vinyl monomer are preferred.The polyvalent metal is preferably selected from alkaline earth or transition metals. For example the polyvalent metal include calcium , copper zincII, manganeseII, manganeseIII, leadII, cobaltII, itonIII, vanadiumII, and zirconiumIV. These salts or complexes accelerate the action of organic hydroperoxide and promote oxidative curing in organic peroxide amine catalyst system. Other examples of the acid component or anion of the drier salt are those of resinic acids, that is, rosin acids , tall oil fatty acids, linseed oil fatty acids, 2 ethylhexanoic acid, lauric acid, palmitic acid, myristic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, behenic acid, cerotic acid, montanic acid, and or abietic acid. A mixture of drier salts may be used. Preferred polyvalent metal catalysts are the transition metal and alkaline earth naphthenates, octoates, and acetylacetonates. Especially preferred drier salts are those of cobalt, vanadium and manganese, such as cobalt octoate, cobalt naphthenate, cobalt acetylacetonate, manganese octoate, manganese naphthenate, and manganese acetylacetonate and vanadium acetylacetonate.Para dimethylamino benzaldehyde may be used with drier salts to enhance surface cure, and compositions containing p dimethylamino benzaldehyde and cobalt salts are preferred. The compositions of the present invention may be useful as surface coatings for a variety of substrates.This invention permits the application of coatings with less thickness than previous practical applications because of the surface cure acceleration. While nonporous substrates, which can be wet out with the vinyl monomer composition, can be coated, these vinyl monomer compositions are particularly useful for impregnating and or sealing porous surfaces such as concrete. In addition, the vinyl monomer composition may be filled with sand, aggregate or other filler to yield polymer concrete compositions. These may be used for a variety of purposes, such as repairing damaged or weathered exterior concrete on structures and roads, bridge deck repair or new floor surfaces for industrial plants. When the compositions of this invention are used for sealing or impregnating porous surfaces, or when they are used to prepare polymer concrete compositions, the preferred low volatility vinyl monomer species are selected from one or more of dicyclopentenyloxy C2 C6 alkyl acrylates and or the corresponding methacrylates, dicyclopentenyl acrylate and or the corresponding methacrylate, and hydroxy C1 C4 alkylacrylates and or the corresponding methacrylates. Preferred flexibility enhancing monomers are selected from the C8 C16 alkyl acrylates and or C8 C16 alkyl methacrylates. Preferred multifunctional monomers are selected from the diacrylates, triacrylates, dimethacrylates and or trimethacrylates. Dicyclopentenyl acrylate, dicyclopentenyl methacrylate, dicyclopentenyloxy C2 C6 alkyl acrylates, and dicyclopentenyloxy C2 C6 alkyl methacrylates are hereinafter referred to collectively as dicyclopentenyl monomers. Hydroxy C1 C4 alkyl acrylates and hydroxy C1 C4 alkyl methacrylates are hereinafter referred to collectively as hydroxyalkyl t monomers.It is preferred that the vinyl monomer of this invention contain from 25 to 75 by weight of total vinyl monomer of dicyclopentenyl monomer and from 75 to 25 by weight of total vinyl monomer of hydroxyalkyl monomer. It is also preferred that the vinyl monomer contain from 2 to 20 by weight of total vinyl monomer of multifunctional monomer.It is preferred that the vinyl monomer contain from 2 to 35 by weight of the total monomer of the flexibilizing monomer. Especially preferred dicyclopentenyl monomers are dicyclopentenyloxyethyl methacrylate, dicyclopentenyl acrylate and dicyclopentenyl methacrylate. Especially preferred hydroxyalkyl monomers are hydroxyethyl methacrylate and hydroxypropyl methacrylate. An especially preferred multi functional monomer is tetraethyleneglycol dimethacrylate. Especially preferred flexibilizing monomers are lauryl methacrylate and isodecyl methacrylate. In using the compositions of this invention as surface coatings and impregnants, and as polymer concrete binders, and in similar applications, it is necessary to provide some additional means of polymerizing the bulk of the vinyl monomer which is not sufficiently close to the surface of the composition to be effectively cured by the surface cure catalyst provided. The bulk may be polymerized by any of the methods which are known in the art as useful for polymerization of vinyl monomers. For example, the bulk may be cured by free radical polymerization. The free radicals may be generated by thermal decomposition of an initiator species dispersed or dissolved in the composition or they may be generated by exposing the composition to high energy radiation such as gamma radiation.Alternatively, in the case of a relatively thin coating, a particle beam may be applied to the composition, such as an electron beam. If an initiator species is employed, it may be used as an element of a polymerization catalyst system. For example, it may be used as part of an oxidation radiation catalyst system. The polymerization catalyst system may initiate and or catalyze the polymerization of the vinyl monomer employed in the compositions of this invention. Multiple catalysts and or initiators may be employed simultaneously. Among the free radical initiator species which may be used are the organic peroxides and or hydroperoxides. The organic peroxides and hydroperoxides that may be used include the peroxides and the hydroperoxides derived from hydrocarbons which contain from 3 to 18 carbon atoms and which are soluble in the vinyl monomer composition.Suitable organic hydroperoxides include tertiary butylhydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide CHP , methyl ethyl ketone hydroperoxide and diisopropylbenzene hydroperoxide.Suitable peroxides include benzoyl peroxide BPO , tertiary butyl perbenzoate, 2,2 bis tert butylperoxy butane peroxide, bis 1 hydroxy cyclohexyl butane peroxide, and tert butylperoxy isopropyl carbonate. Preferred free radical initiators are cumene hydroperoxide and benzoyl peroxide. Aromatic amines may be used in small amounts to accelerate the action of the peroxide. Aromatic amines, including for example, aniline, N,N dimethylaniline,N,N diethylaniline, toluidine, N,N dimethyl p toluidine, N,N di hydroxyethyl toluidine, and or p dimethylaminobenzaldehyde, may be added in an amount of 0.1 to 3 percent by weight of the vinyl monomer composition.Para dimethylamino benzaldehyde is preferred, especially when used in connection with a polyvalent metal oxidative cure catalyst such as cobalt naphthenate. Para aminobenzaldehyde enhances the surface cure provided by cumene hydroperoxide initiator and an especially preferable polymerization catalyst is a mixture of benzoyl peroxide andN,N dimethyl p toluidine. The polyvalent metal salt or complex may be formed in situ. The polyvalent metal salt or complex, preferably admixed with peroxide, in small amounts, can be added to the vinyl monomer composition before use. The proportion of metal salt or complex added to the composition before use may be from 0.0005 weight percent up to 2 weight percent, and the amount of peroxide or hydroperoxide may be in the range of 0.1 to 3 weight percent, based on the total weight of the monomers. Similarly, the polyvalent metal salt or complex can be added to the vinyl monomer composition before use and admixed with both peroxide and aromatic amine accelerator. The proportion of the peroxide to the composition may be in the range of 0.1 to 3 weight percent and the aromatic amine accelerator is used in an effective amount, usually in the range of about 0.1 to 5 weight percent. The polyvalent metal salt or complex and hydroperoxide, or the aromatic amine accelerator, and peroxide and polyvalent metal salt or complex, may be kept in separate packages and shipped separately to the site of operations where the respective components may be combined and where the composition of the present invention is to be used, as by pouring to impregnate a concrete floor, base, or pavement. Alternatively, the aromatic amine accelerator and vinyl monomer composition may be combined in a package for storing and shipping before combining them with the organic peroxide before using the composition. The composition may be colored by a suitable amount of pigment or dye dissolved in the vinyl monomer composition. The amount of such pigment or dye may vary from about 18 to 108 by weight of the composition. The compositions of this invention may additionally comprise a minor amount of at least one drying oil.Examples of drying oils which may be employed in the compositions of this invention include tung oil, linseed oil, soybean oil, isomerized linseed oil, soy oil, safflower oil, sunflower seed oil, caster oil, and tall oil. The compositions of this invention may in addition comprise a solvent for the vinyl monomer. The solvent may be used in an amount effective to reduce the viscosity of the vinyl monomer in order to increase the rate and depth of penetration of the composition into the substrate when the vinyl monomer composition is used as an impregnant.Solvents which are both volatile and polar are preferred.The addition of a solvent or solvent mixture to the vinyl monomer may also be useful when it is necessary to achieve a viscosity within a specific range for other purposes. For example, when the mode of application of the composition is by spray, a low viscosity is often desirable in order to speed the application process and make efficient use of the application equipment employed. Examples of solvents which may be used are methanol, ethanol, butanol, xylene, mineral spirits, or methyl amyl ketone. The compositions of this invention may additionally comprise a stabilizer or monomer inhibitor such as a ketoxime stabilizer or hydroquinone as an inhibitor. In addition, other well known adjuvants can be included in the compositions of the invention including, for example, antioxidants and antiozonidants and flow control agents. tn order to further accelerate the surface cure of the esmpositions of this invention, they may additionally comprise minor amount of photoactive compound. Preferably the Fotctie compound is selected from benzophenone and or benzophenone derivatives of the formulaC6H5C O C6H4R where R is selected from 4 CH3, OH, NH2, C1, CO2H, CO2CH 2 CO2H, CO2CH3, NH2OH and 3 NO2, CO2H and CO2CH3. The photoactive compound is also useful in promoting the cure of the surface of the compositions of the present invention, when applied to exterior surfaces. It is understood that commercial grade hydroxyethyl methacrylate and hydroxypropyl methacrylate monomers may be used and that, as is known in the art, such commercial grade monomers generally contain about 90 and 92 , respectively, of the desired ester product, the balance to 100 being high boiling methacrylate compounds, methacrylic acid, dimethacrylate compounds and the corresponding alkylene oxide. The compositions described hereinabove may be hard and tough when cured. When it is desired to render such compositions more flexible, a small proportion of a drying oil, such as linseed oil, as described above, or of an acrylic polymer having a low glass transition temperature T , for example poly ethylacrylate , poly butylacrylate , g and or poly 2 ethylhexylacrylate , or a mixture of a drying oil and low Tg acrylic polymer, may be added to the composition and may replace part of the vinyl monomer. Alternatively, the vinyl monomers may be used with a small proportion of an auxiliary liquid monomeric acrylate and or vinyl ester binder forming material which is of low volatility and can reduce the hardness and impart a more flexible or resilient character to the final composition. A mixture of a drying oil and an auxiliary monomer may also be used. Such other suitable acrylic ester monomers include Clo c3o alkyl or C12 C3o alkenyl acrylates and or methacrylates such as lauryl acrylate, myristyl acrylate, palmityl acrylate, oleyl acrylate, linoleyl acrylate, linolenyl acrylate and or stearyl acrylate. As stated above, the C8 C16 alkyl acrylates and C8 C10 alkyl methacryla es are preferred. Lauryl methacrylate and isodecyl methacrylate are especially preferred. Similar improvements in flexibility may be obtained by including the vinyl monomers long chain C12 C30 aliphatic acid vinyl esters, e.g. vinyl laurate, vinyl oleate, vinyl stearate or di C4 C8 alkyl esters of maleic acid, fumaric acid, or itaconic acid, e.g., dibutyl, dihexyl, or dioctyl fumarate, maleate, or itaconate as well as di meth acrylates of polyethers such as polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, or polytetramethylene glycol.As stated above, vinyl monomer may also be used with small proportions of multifunctional, i.e., polyethylenically unsaturated, monomers such as polyol meth acrylates and polyalkylene polyol meth acrylates, such as ethylene glycol diacrylate or dimethacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate or trimethacrylate, triethylene glycol di meth acrylate, etc. All of these monomeric materials have low volatility and are polymerizable by the action of the peroxide and the metal salt drier to form products having greater toughness and resistance to water, organic solvents, acids, and alkali. The proportion of these auxiliary monomers, if used, may be from about F percent to 40 by weight of the vinyl monomer component, but preferably is not over about 30 by weight of such component. The invention contemplates the impregnation of already formed articles having a porous surface with the compositions of this invention penetrating at least the outer pores of the surface of such porous articles to make the surface resistant to penetration by such liquids as water, organic solvents, acids, alkalies, or other corrosive liquids. Examples of porous surfaced materials include portland cement concrete, stone masonry or brick walls, including the facings of the mortar between the bricks and stones, weathered archeological artifacts and wall structures, weathered granite and marble walks and sculptures previously formed and hardened, floors, walls, and ceilings, whether formed of plaster, concrete, cement, wood, pressed boards, pressed metals such as those formed of iron, aluminum, and steel binders, and the like.Impregnation of the surfaces of such articles with the compositions of this invention results in the impartation of a hardened, relatively impermeable surface adapted to resist cracking as well as penetration by means of moisture and other liquids such as those mentioned above. Such impregnation results in rendering the objects resistant to the corrosive and degradative effects caused by weathering and subjection to atmospheric smog resulting from discharges into the air of industrial and internal combustion waste gases, e.g., oxides and sulfur, nitrogen, and carbon, from autos, et al. The compositions of this invention may be applied to the porous substrate to be coated, impregnated or sealed, by a variety of methods. For example, the composition may simply be poured on the substrate and spread, using, for example, a rubber squeegee, a string mop, a sponge mop or the like. After allowing a sufficient time for penetration to occur, usually a few minutes, excess material may be removed if desired. Alternatively, the composition may be sprayed onto the substrate using airless spray, or spray equipment employing air, nitrogen or some other type of propellant. Several coats of composition may be applied.To some extent, the appropriate method of application and amount of material to be applied is determined by the nature and porosity of the substrate, and can and will be determined by those skilled in the sealer coating application art. Whether the compositions of this invention will function when cured as a coating, sealer or impregnant is determined in part by the porosity and nature of.the substrate. For example, if the substrate contains macroscopic voids which cannot be filled in their entirety by the composition, then the composition will not function effectively as a sealer rchen cured. However, even in the case in which the impregnant composition does not function as a sealer when cured, the composition serves to strengthen the porous substrate and increase its resistance to environmental degradation, as, for example, by increasing its resistance to cracking. When used as polymer concrete, the compositions of this invention may include pigments, fillers, and other materials including aggregates, especially small sized aggregates. The aggregate that is mixed with the vinyl monomer can be any material whether capable of curing or not.Examples of inert materials are very small pebbles, sand, or other so called aggregate materials used in the making of concrete. The sand that may be used may be of any quality or of any size. Sand of small particle size such as Ottawa sand and Best sand or a mixture of the two may be used to advantage. Ottawa sand is a silica sand of the type referred to as round . Best sand is of the type known as sharp . In both cases, fines can be used. In general, however, the sieve size of the sand may vary over a fairly wide range. In lieu of or in addition to sand, it is possible to use ground glass, emery powder, ground slag, very fine gravel, trap rock and similar aggregates. It is often advantageous to incorporate in the mixture, with or without sand, a minor fraction of clay and or of a hydraulic cement if so, the clay may take the form of kaolin, china clay, porcelain clay, fire clay, pipe clay, Bentonite, and, in fact, almost any of the known types of clay. Of course, other materials of small nature may be employed including broken clay products, marble chips, crushed stone, and cther typical aggregate materials used i the making of terrazzo floors or walls provided they are mll in size in comparison wit the pores to be filled.The hydraulic cement that may be employed includes portland cement e the Various types the white cements, the netural cements, pozzolanic cements, cements derived from industrial slags and fly ash , aluminous cements, and, in general, all of the commercially available hydraulic cements. Also included are hydraulic limes and similar materials of kinds well known to those skilled in the art. The invention is now further described by way of the following examples.

In another experiment, dispersions of diolefin acrylic rubbers are prepared in HPMA, adding the particulate elastomers to the HPMA while agitating with a propeller type mixer. The dispersions are 40 solid elastomer 60 HPMA wt. . The diene rubber is Rl. The acrylate rubber is R3, an emulsion polymer prepared with 5.6 weight seed, 73.6 2 EHA 0.8 ALMA 19.4 MMA 0.6 ALMA, and isolated as a powder by freeze drying. A 10 dispersion of Thixatrol ST thickener in DCPOEMA is prepared on a Cowles disperser Thixatrol ST is a hydrogenated castor oil derivative designed to impart thixotropic flow properties . Mixtures of the above dispersions with HPMA, DCPOEMA, 6 Cobalt Ten Cem Mooney Chemical , and cumene hydroperoxide 73 active are prepared, using 0.4 grams 6 cobalt and 0.4 grams cumene hydroperoxide per 20 grams ofHPMA dispersions DCPOEMA. The mixtures are drawn with a casting block having a 0.05 cm 20 mil gate on Bonderite 1000 pretreated cold rolled steel. The panels are weighed before and immediately after drawing the films. The panels are reweighed at various times after casting. The weight loss is primarily a measure of the HPMA lost from the film by volatilization. Films having slower rates of cure will lose more weight during cure. Table IV shows binder compositions and weight loss data.

Comparative examples are denoted by C. The diolefin rubber gives dramatic improvement of film cure when replacing DCPOEMA, while the acrylate rubber gives poorer film cure.Decorative Coatings Polymer concrete compositions may be used as decorative coatings for exterior surfaces such as concrete block, portland cement, brick and the like. Such decorative coatings are often pigmented. One problem encountered with pigmented decorative coatings prepared from polymer concrete compositions in the past has been chalking and fading of the color on the coatirg surface. Pigmented polymer concrcte prepared with the vinyl monomer compositions of the present invention are useful as decorative coatings. In order to compare the fade resistance of the compositions of this invention with those of the prior art, the change in Delta E is measured by the Hunter color comparison test, after exposing the panels in a preliminary screening test related to durability. The screening test employs a 24 hour exposure in a fog box.See Paint Testing Manual, ASTMPublication 500 G. Sward Ed. Chapter 1 and Paint Coatins Dictionary, Fed. Soc. Coatings Tech. 222 223, 292 293, for an explanation of the Hunter equation and the color difference test. The vinyl monomer mixture employed has the following composition DCPOEMA 50 parts by weight HPMA 50 parts by weight DMAB 4 parts by weightThe aggregate dry mix for the polymer concrete has the following composition Parts by Weight num 2 mesh sand 40.2 num 45 mesh sand 40.2 Silica flour 17.0 White Pigment Titanium Dioxide 0.5 Red Pigment Red Iron Oxide 1.2 Cadox BFF 50 50 Benzoyl 0.7 Peroxide in plasticizer Catalyst 4142 solid grade of 0.2 cobalt neodecanoate, 11.2 Co The dry mix and the monomer mixture are mixed by weight in the proportions indicated in Table V below.In the case of Examples 14, 16, and 17, the R1 diolefin rubber powder is dispersed in the monomer mixture prior to mixing with the dry mix. In the case of Example 15, the R1 diolefin rubber is added to the monomer as an emulsion the powder form is typically produced by drying such an emulsion . The polymer concrete is applied to mild steel panels Q panels from Q Panel Corporation at thickness of about 1 16 inch by spreading with a spatula. The panels are allowed to cure for 3 days in the laboratory, then 13 days on the roof of the laboratory. Cured panels are exposed in a fog box for 64 hours.The quantity Delta E is measured for each panel prior to and subsequent to exposure. The change in Delta E is reported in Table V below.

Calculated using the Hunter Color Difference Equation from color differences measured using a Model b25b24 color difference meter manufactured by Hunter Lab. The results reported in Table V indicate that the vinyl monomer compositions of the present invention yield polymer concrete with superior color fade resistance.
