# Manifold exhaust processor.

## Abstract
A manifold exhaust processor includes a pair of sub strates 32, 34 mounted within the interior of an exhaust manifold housing and aligned in end to end relation to permit each substrate to treat the combusion product exhausted from a different group of engine cylinders and to equalize the temperatures of the outer skin and centerline portion of the substrate to reduce thermal stress. A common outlet 30 is provided to exhaust the treated combustion product. The first substrate is mounted in a first chamber of the manifold housing in close proximity to a first inlet to cause combustion product to be introduced into the first chamber in a direction toward a side wall of the first substrate to promote tangential flow about the side wall and around the substrate. Likewise, the second substrate is mounted in a second chamber of the manifold housing in spaced apart, end to end relation with the first substrate and in close proximity to a second inlet to cause combustion product to be introduced into the second chamber in a direction toward a side wall of the second substrate, and also to promote tangential flow.
