The procedure of Example 5 was repeated, except that in Stage 4 3 2 hydroxyethoxy propylamine 6.0g was substituted for 6 aminohexanol in Stage 4 and the dye was precipitated with potassium acetate 40 w v instead of salt 30 w v and the product washed with potassium acetate solution 40 w v 100g prior to dialysis, to produce the dye hereinbefore identified as Dye 8, i.e. the dye of Formula I in which X and Y are as in Dye 5, R¹ is 3 2 hydroxyethoxy propyl and R² is H. The aforementioned water soluble dye of Formula I and certain closely related dyes which contain less than three azo groups are adapted for use in an ink, particularly a writing or printing ink based upon water and or a water miscible organic solvent, such as an alkanol or glycol, and especially an ink suitable for ink jet printing wherein the ink is ejected from an orifice of a recording head in the form of liquid droplets. For recording on paper or the like with writing tools fountain pen, felt pen, etc. , it is conventional to use an ink which is a solution of a dye in water or a water miscible organic solvent and an ink of similar composition is also used in ink jet printing. In ink jet printing, droplets of ink are generated in various ways and deposited on a substrate to effect a record. A suitable ink comprises, as essential components, a recording agent usually a dye or a pigment and a liquid vehicle usually water, an organic solvent or mixtures thereof and, as optional components, various other additives. Ink jet printing may be classified into various systems depending on the method for generation of ink droplets and the method for controlling the flight direction of ink droplets. An example of a device in accordance with one system is shown in Figure 1. The device shown in Figure 1 operates by providing a printing signal at the print head section having a piezoelectric oscillator and generating ink droplets corresponding to said signal. In Figure 1, a print head 1, comprises a piezo oscillator 2, an inlet line 3 for ink, a liquid chamber 4, and an outlet line 5 leading to a nozzle 6 directed at a substrate 12. Ink 7 is introduced into the liquid chamber 4, through inlet 3 and fills the chamber 4 and the outlet line up to the nozzle 6. A pulsed electrical signal derived from a pattern information signal is applied to the piezo electric oscillator 2 which transforms the pulsed electrical signal into pressure pulses and applies these to the ink 7 in the liquid chamber 4. As a result, the ink 7 is discharged as droplets 11 through the nozzle 6 thereby to effect recording on the surface of the substrate 12. An example of another type of device using the same system is shown in Figure 2, in which a tubular liquid chamber 4 links the inlet and outlet lines 3, 5 and a cylindrical piezoelectric oscillator 2 is arranged around the outer peripheral portion of the chamber 4. The mechanism for generation of ink droplets is essentially the same as in the device as shown in Figure 1. In another system, charged droplets are continuously generated but only a proportion of the droplets are selected for recording. In yet another system, heat energy corresponding to the pattern information signal is imparted to the ink in the chamber of print head, and liquid droplets are formed by said energy. An embodiment of such a device is shown in Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 is a cross sectional view along the length of a tube 14 in a print head 13 and Figure 4 is a cross sectional view taken on the line A B in Figure 3. In Figures 3 and 4 a print head 13, for heat sensitive recording by the deposit of droplets 24 of ink 21 on a substrate 25, comprises a thin walled tube 14 terminating at a nozzle 12 carrying a heat generator 15. The heat generator 15 comprises a pair of spaced aluminium electrodes 16, 17, defining a gap occupied by a nichrome heating resistor 18 the ends of the electrodes 16, 17 and the resistor 18 being encased in a layer of insulant 19 and a protective envelope 20. In operation an ink 21 is fed into the right hand end of the tube 14 under slight pressure and forms a meniscus at the nozzle 12. The application of a pulsed electric signal, derived from a pattern information signal, across the electrodes 16, 17, generates pulses of heat in the resistor 18 which are transferred across the wall of the tube and cause the formation of bubbles in the ink 21 adjacent to the resistor 18. The excess pressure developed by the bubbles causes discharge of the ink 21 from the nozzle 12 in the form of small droplets 24, each corresponding to a electric pulse, directed at the substrate 25. As ink jet printing generates little noise and allows high speed multi colour operation without the need for special dye fixation treatments, a number of different ink jet printing systems are currently being intensively investigated. An ink for any of the various types of ink jet printing systems need to meet the following criteria However, images produced by conventional inks, particularly water based inks, tend to form blots, dislocations or scratches, or to fade by water adhesion, mechanical friction, or exposure to light and an ink free from these drawbacks is an urgent requirement. In addition to the above criteria, an ink for use in an ink jet printing process using heat energy, must also have excellent heat stability. The ink, if thermally unstable, is liable to undergo chemical change because it is exposed to a high temperature during repetition of the generation and extinction of bubbles by heating, with the result that insoluble matter forms and deposits on the wall of the heating zone of the recording head, which, in turn, renders the recording head to be eventually incapable of discharging the liquid therethrough. Accordingly, the thermal stability of the ink is very important for continuous high speed recording over a long period of time. Although a number of inks have been proposed to overcome these problems, none have been produced which meet all the foregoing requirements. According to a second feature of the present invention there is provided an ink comprising a water soluble dye of Formula I. It is possible, by use of a dye in accordance with Formula I to obtain an ink having an improved solution stability, particularly during a prolonged storage in concentrated form, and having excellent recording properties, particularly ejection stability, ejection responsiveness, and continuous recording workability. The present ink is of practical importance and gives images having good water resistance, alcohol resistance and light resistance. The present ink preferably comprises the dye and a liquid medium, such as water, an organic solvent or a mixture thereof. The dye of the first feature of the present invention has especially good solution stability in the above mentioned liquid medium, thereby improving the ejection stability of the ink and reducing the incidence of plugging of the ejecting orifice even after a long period of storage in the recording apparatus. The amount of the dye in the ink is determined in accordance with the desired optical density of the image, the type of recording device to be used, other components to be added, the required physical properties of ink, etc. But generally speaking, a suitable dye content is in the range of 0.5 20 , preferably 0.5 15 , and especially 1 10 , by weight based on the total weight of the ink. The present ink can contain, besides the hereinbefore defined dye of Formula I, other dyes selected from various types of known dyes such as direct dyes, acid dyes, and the like but preferably contain only dye in accordance with the first aspect of the present invention or dyes having similar performance characteristics in ink jet printing. Liquid media used for preparing the present ink include water and mixtures of water with various water soluble organic solvents. The water soluble organic solvents include C₁ C₄ alkanols such as methanol, ethanol, n propanol, isopropanol, n butanol, sec butanol, tert butanol, isobutanol amides such as dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide ketones or ketone alcohols such as acetone and diacetone alcohol ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane nitrogen containing heterocyclic ketones such as N methyl 2 pyrrolidone and 1,3 dimethyl 2 imidazol idinone polyalkylene glycols such as polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol alkylene glycols and thioglycols containing C₂ C₆ alkylene groups such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, triethylene glycol thiodiglycol, hexylene glycol, and diethylene glycol other polyols such as glycerol, 1,2,6 hexanetriol and lower alkyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols much as 2 methoxyethanol, 2 2 methoxyethoxy ethanol, 2 2 ethoxyethoxy ethanol and 2 2 2 methoxyethoxy ethoxy ethanol, 2 2 2 ethoxyethoxy ethoxy ethanol. Preferred water soluble organic solvents among these are glycols and glycol ethers, such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol and 2 methoxy 2 ethoxy 2 ethoxyethanol polyethylene glycols with molecular weights up to 500 and heterocyclic ketones such as N methylpyrrolidone and 1,3 dimethyl 2 imidazolidione. Preferred specific solvent mixtures are a binary mixture of water and diethylene glycol and a tertiary mixture of water, diethylene glycol and N methyl pyrrolidone. The present ink preferably contains from 5 95 , preferably 10 80 , and especially 20 50 , by weight of water soluble organic solvent based on the total weight of the ink. Examples of specific inks in accordance with the second aspect of the present invention are The present ink, prepared from the components mentioned above, is generally characterised by excellent and balanced recording performance characteristics i.e. signal responsiveness, stability for producing droplets, ejection stability, long term continuous recording workability, and ejection stability after a long rest. It also generally exhibits good preservation stability, solution stability, fixation on the recording substrate and resistance of the recorded image to water, alcohol, light and weather. However, miscellaneous known additives may also be incorporated into the present ink for further improvement of these characteristics. Examples of suitable additives are viscosity modifiers, such as poly vinyl alcohol , cellulose derivatives, and other water soluble resins various kinds of surfactants, i.e. cationic, anionic, and nonionic surface tension modifiers, such as diethanolamine and triethanolamine and pH conditioners, such as buffers. Inks for use in ink jet recording of the type based on the application of a charge to the ink droplets usually contain an inorganic salt, such as lithium chloride, ammonium chloride or sodium chloride as a resistivity modifier. Urea or thiourea may also be added to improve the water retentivity of the ink at the tip of the ejecting orifice. When the present ink is used for ink jet recording of the type based on the action of thermal energy, the thermal properties, e.g. specific heat, coefficient of thermal expansion, and heat conductivity, of the ink may be modified by suitable additives. If the present ink is to be applied by means of a writing tool, e.g. a pen, it may be necessary to modify the viscosity and the other physical properties in relation to the affinity of the ink for the recording substrate. The present ink represents a significant step towards satisfying all the requirements stated above, that is to say, to providing an ink which does not plug capillary tubes or ejecting orifices, does not result in deterioration or formation of precipitate during storage, is excellent in recording workability, particularly ejection ability and ejection responsiveness and gives such good quality images as to be excellent in colour density, shade, and contrast and have good resistance to water, solvent, light weather, and abrasion and excellent fixing properties. Furthermore, certain preferred classes of the present inks are particularly suitable for use in an ink jet recording process utilising thermal energy because of their good long term heat stability. The present invention in so far as it relates to inks is further illustrated with reference to the following Examples in which all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated. Four inks were prepared, using the Dyes 1 to 4 as described in Examples 1 to 4 above, and the following ingredients The above mentioned inks were prepared by thorough mixing of the ingredients, filtering the solution under pressure through a Teflon filter pore size 1 micron and degassing the filtered ink, in vacuo. For each of the inks the following five characteristics, T₁ T₅, were measured using a recording apparatus having an on demand type of recording head 50u diameter ejecting orifice, piezo oscillator driving voltage 60V, frequency 4KHz . Each ink gave good results in each test. Each ink was sealed separately in a glass container and stored at 30 C and at 60 C for 6 months. In each case there was no appreciable separation of any insoluble matter or any change in physical properties and colour. Each ink was subjected to continuous recording tests at room temperature, 5 C, and 40 C for 24 hours. Each ink gave high quality images constantly throughout the test period at each temperature. Each ink was subjected to intermittent ejection at two second intervals and ejection after standing for two months and each ink showed stable uniform recording without causing plugging of the orifice. Images recorded on the following three types of recording paper were of high optical density and sharp and clear in all cases. Each image, after exposure to ambient light in a room for three months, showed a reduction in optical density not greater than 1 . Results of immersing the recorded papers in water for one minute showed a very little blotting of the images. Images recorded on the above mentioned three types of recording paper were rubbed with a finger 15 seconds after recording, and without forming any smudges or blots, indicating the excellent fixation properties of the images. An element for transforming electric energy into thermal energy was prepared on an alumina substrate as follows. A SiO₂ lower layer 5 microns thick was formed over the alumina substrate by sputtering and a 1000 A HfB₂ layer, as a heat generating resistor layer, and a 3000 A aluminum layer, as an electrode, were successively laid thereover. A heat generating resistor pattern having size of 50 x 200 microns was formed by selective etching of the aluminum layer. A SiO₂ layer 3500 A thick, as a protective upper layer, was then laid thereover. A print head was formed by bonding a glass plate on which grooves 50 microns wide and 50 microns deep had been engraved onto the SiO₂ protective layer in register with the etched pattern on the heat generating resistor. The tip surface of orifice was then polished so that the distance between the tip of heat generating resistor and the tip surface of orifice was 250 microns. The print head was operated by applying printing signals of 40V x 10 ⁵ sec rectangular voltage pulses at a cycle of 2x10 ⁴sec. The print head operated normally and without blockage for 160 hours using an ink having the following composition In a comparative test the print head operated satisfactorily for only 10 hours, under the same conditions as above, using an ink having the same composition as the above ink except for the replacement of Dye 2 with a dye of Formula I in which R¹ and R² are both hydroxyethyl, Y is phenyl and X is 4 sulpho 7 2 sulpho 4 methoxyphenylazo 8 hydroxynaphth 2 ylamino. The print head was operated similarly to Example 10 using inks having the same compositions except that Dye 2 was replaced by the stated quantity of each of the dyes listed in Table 1, by applying printing signals of 50V x 10 ⁵ sec rectangular voltage pulses at a cycle of 2x10 ⁴sec. The resulting satisfactory operating periods are shown in Table 1. Inks having the compositions defined in Table 2 were prepared and tested for properties T₁ T₅, in the same manner as in Example 9. The results indicated that all these inks have good characteristics, and particularly excellent recording performance, fixation properties and sharpness of image. Each of the the inks containing a dye of Formula I described in Examples 9 to 15 was charged separately into a commercial fountain pen and a record was made on plain paper. Each record showed no blotting of image and a high rate of absorption of ink.
