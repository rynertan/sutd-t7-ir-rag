# Master cylinder with a proportioning valve.

## Abstract
A master cylinder of the kind comprising a housing defining a split reservoir and a bore, two aligned pistons received in said bore and defining therewith two pressure chambers in fluid communication with respective brake circuits, and a proportioning valve interposed between one of said chambers and its associated brake circuit for reducing the pressure signal transmitted to this latter dur ing a brake application. The invention provides for a pressure differential re sponsive member 50 slidably received within the bore 26 between the respective pressure chambers 32, 34 and designed so as to deactivate the proportioning valve 36 in case of leakage in the other pressure chamber 32 or its associated brake circuit 16 . For use in automotive braking systems.
