# DIAZO DEVELOPER ABSORPTION APPARATUS

## Abstract
Apparatus for removing ammonia or other alkaline diazo developer from copier gas, uses a packed column 5 through which the air passes, while acid solution as absorbing liquid is continuously in countercurrent until the acid solution in the reservor 21, 24 becomes exhausted, and is re placed. A multistage fan oyed to drive the air against the back pressure processed by the packed column 5 . The ap paratus can treat the air from a high throughput copier and is surprisingly free from by salts evaporated from the absorber solution.
