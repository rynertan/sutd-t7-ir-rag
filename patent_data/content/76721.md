## Description
PROCESS FOR THE CARBONYLATION OF SECONDARY BENZYL HALIDES The present invention concerns a process for the carbonylation of secondary benzyl halides. More particularly, the present invention relates to a catalytic process for the synthesis of alkaline salts of alpha aryl propionic acids, and of 3 aryl 3 methyl pyruvi c or al pha keto beta aryl butyri c acids, starting from the corresponding 1 hal ogen 1 aryl ethanes, also referred to in the following present description as benzyl halides , and from carbon monoxide in a biphasic liquidiliquid system, in the presence of alkaline bases. More particularly, the above process is carried out in the presence of a catalyst consisting of carbonyl complexes of cobalt. From the alkaline salts the corresponding acids are easily obtainable by acidification with mineral acids such as HC1, H2SO4, etc. , by extraction, etc., according to conventional methods. The process is based on the carbonylation reaction of 1 halogen1 arylethanes and involves the insertion of the carboxylic group or of the alpha keto carboxylic group on a secondary carbon atom under catalytic conditions provided by Co carbonyl complexes, in the presence of alkaline bases, said catalysis being carried out in a biphasic organic aqueous system. The organic carboxylic acids obtained according to the present invention present the following general formula I EMI1.1 wherein Ar represents either an aromatic or a heteroaromatic group containing one or several rings, linked together, and having overall up to 20 carbon atoms, and preferably being a phenyl, napthtyl, diphenyl, or thienyl group, while n is an integer equal to 1 or 2. Said Ar group may in turn be substituted by groups that are inert under reaction conditions. Compatible groups are, for instance, alkylic, alicyclic or arylic groups, each of them optionally substituted, halogen, alcoxyl, phenoxyl, ketone groups, etc. The compounds obtained represent worthwhile products having useful applications in a wide range of commercial fields. More particularly, the alpha aryl propionic acids represent important products in the field of high purity chemicals as well as in the field of phytodrugs and especially of pharmaceutical products. Products of this class, such as for instance 2 4 isobutylphenyl propionic acid and 2 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl propionic acid, are of special interest to the pharmaceutical industry as antiinflammatory, analgesical, anti pyrethi cal agents, etc. As stated herein above, the process of this invention is based on the carbonylation reaction conducted on a secondary benzyl halide having the following formula II EMI2.1 wherein Ar has already been defined, and X is Cl or Br, in the presence of a catalytic system consisting of carbonylic complexes of Co, in a biphasic organic liquid aqueous liquid system, more clearly defined herein below. Research has only recently turned towards the carbonylation of substrates of the secondary benzyl type, such as for instance the secondary aryl alkyl halides. This type of carbonylation, besides raising problems as to the reaction mechanism involved, also has the drawback of leading to operational difficulties as to the possible yields, etc. Literature on the subject is not particularly extensive especially as regards commercial production. Practically, it may, however, be affirmed that, up to now, the alphaaryl propionic acids and alkaline salts thereof, subject of the present invention, have been prepared by different methods such as among others hydrolysis of the corresponding nitriles reaction of CO2 with Grignard compounds decarbonylation of malonic derivatives oxidation of alcohols or of aldehydes having a suitable structure or by reduction of aryl acrylic acids, etc. In fact these methods, technologically distinct from the process of the present invention, are characterized in that they are multi step, non catalytic methods, and especially complicated by the use of reactants not easily available and or manipulable they consequently have corresponding operational and economical drawbacks that make them of little practical commercial interest. On the other hand, catalytic methods for the preparation of alphaaryl propionic acids have recently been suggested. According to one of these methods, substituted alpha aryl propionic acids or alkyl esters thereof are prepared by means of either hydrocarboxylation or by hydrocarbalkoxylation of substituted aryl ethylenes in either alcohol or aqueous mediums, catalyzed by palladium complexes, preferably in the presence of acids. Nonetheless, the commercial interest offered by the above method does not appear high. In fact this method, among other difficulties involved, foresees the use of expensive Pd complexes as catalysts and the use of high CO pressures. in the prior art carbonylation reactions of halogen derivatives of the type of formula II with Pd and Co complexes are also reported,these reactions producing esters of alpha aryl propionic acids. In the first case the use of expensive catalysts such as the arsinic complexes of Pd under CO pressure is foreseen. Moreover, the esters obtained have poor yields and low selectivity. In the second case, the method foresees the formation of esters by the use of alkaline alcoholates in the presence of dicobalto octacarbonyl.Also in this case yields and selectivities are poor in fact, substantial amounts of linear isomer acid ethers and esters are obtained. This involves operational drawbacks as to the separation and purification of the products. Morover, a further economical consists in the use of alcoholates under strictly controlled pH conditions. Further, the reaction proves strictly limited to phenyl derivatives, possibly only alkyl substituted phenyl derivatives. On the other hand, methods have been described for the preparation of alpha keto beta aryl butyric acids, according to formula I in which n 2. These are laboratory methods and, thus, of little commercial interest, not being adapted to the technology according to the present invention. The object of the present invention is to provide a simple and inexpensive catalytic process for the preparation, on an commercial scale, of the acids of formula I or of their alkaline salts, that is free of the drawbacks of the prior art analyzed herein above. In fact, the process according to the present invention, provides for the carbonylation of secondary benzyl substrates of formula it , conducted on a secondary carbon atom under mild operational conditions such as to allow the recycling of the catalytic system consisting of a cobalt hydrocarbonyl salt. This process has the advantage of offering applicational flexibility that will allow the obtention of a much wider range of alphaaryl propionic and keto butyric acid products as well as of their alkaline salts. These and still other objects and advantages, which will appear more clearly to those skilled in the Art in the following description, are achieved, according to this invention, by a process for the preparation of acids of formula I , as previously defined, characterized in that a 1 halo 1 arylethane of formula II , as previously defined, is made to react with carbon monoxide and with an alkaline hydroxide, at a temperature comprised betweenabout 20 Cand 70 C and under a pressure comprised between 1 and 10 atmospheres, in a biphasic aqueous organic liquid system consisting of a an aqueous phase containing the alkaline hydroxide, b an organic phase consisting of the initial halide of formula II dissolved in an organic solvent substantially unmixable with the aqueous alkaline phase, in the presence of an onium salt, more precisely defined herein above, and of a catalysts consisting of a cobalt hydrocarbonyl salt or at least one of its precursors. The reaction may be schematically represented by the following equations EMI4.1 EMI5.1 wherein M represents Na, K or Li, and the organic solvent is further defined herein below, the other symbols having the meaning stated hereinabove. The organic solvent must be substantially unmixable with the aqueous alkaline phase. Effective solvents proved to be linear or branched aliphatic or cycloaliphatic alcohols having from 3 to 10 carbon atoms, possibly arylsubstituted, aromatic and aliphaticethers, aromatic hydrocarbons, Particularly suitable solvents proved to be benzene, diphenylether, t butyl methyl ether, n propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n butyl alcohol, sec butyl alcohol, neopentyl alcohol, n amyl alcohol, t amyl alcohol, cyclo hexanol and l phenylethanol. The catalysts are cobalt hydrocarbonyl salts having the formula III Me CO CO 4ln III wherein Me represents a cation of a metal with valence n, such as the alkaline metals Na, K, Li or cobalt, iron, manganese etc., these cobalt hydrocarbonyl salts being known and prepared according to conventional methods. Preferred catalysts are sodium, cobalt, manganese and iron salts of formula III . Precursors of said salts may, however, also be used. By the term precursor , used in the present description, is meant one or more compounds which in the reaction conditions form the above specified cobalt hydrocarbonyl salt. For instance, the cobalt hydrocarbonyl alkaline salt may be obtained in situ from Co2 CO 8 under the prevailing reaction conditions. In another embodiment of the process according to the invention, the cobalt hydrocarbonyl salt catalyst may preferably be prepared, according to this invention, for instance, from a cobalt salt such as a chloride, sulphate, bromide, etc., from an Fe Mn alloy powder containing about 80 Mn and from sulphurated promoters, in either a methyl or ethyl alcohol, under a carbon monoxide pressure comprised between 1 and 2 atmospheres and at a temperature comprised between 100C and 80 C, but preferably comprised between about 250C and 35 C. The concentration of the cobalt salt in the solution is comprised between 0.3 and 1 mol litre. Per each mole of cobalt salt are used from 1 to 2 moles of Mn in the form of a Fe Mn alloy. The Fe tin alloy is ground beforehand so as to pass through a screen of at least 5 000 mesh sq.cm thus having openings of 0.290 mm . The preferred sulphurated promoters are sodium sulphide and thiosulphate, which are used in quantities comprised between 0.01 and 0.1 mol mol.of cobalt salt. The alcohol mixture containing the cobalt salt, the alloy and the sulphurated promoter in the alcohol solvent, is kept under vigorous stirring under a CO atmosphere for a time sufficient to complete the absorption of the CO, this time being at least 2 3 hours.In this way Mn and or Fe salts of cobalt hydrocarbonyl are obtained.The decanted solution may be directly introduced into the reaction while the solvent may be removed under vacuum, thereby obtaining the catalysts of the invention. In a further embodiment of the process according to the invention, the sodium salt of Co2 CO 8 may also be obtained by reduction with sodium amalgam in an ether solvent tetrahydrofuran .Co2 CO 8 is prepared, for instance, from CoC03 under a CO and hydrogen pressure in petroleum ether. The molar ratio between the 1 halogen 1 arylethane II and the cobalt hydrocarbonyl salt catalyst may vary within a wide range. Convenient results may be obtained, in any casea with values of said molar ratio comprised between 10 1 and about 150 1. The reaction temperature is comprised, as previously indicated, between 20 C and 70 C. The carbon monoxide pressure is comprised between about 1 and 10 atmospheres, although for obtaining compounds I with n 2, the preferred pressures are equal to or greater than 2atmospheres. The reaction is usually completed within a time period of about 1 to 24 hours, depending on parametrical conditions of temperature on concentration on the type of secondary benzyl halide II and on the catalyst used etc. Alkaline hydroxides of Na, K, Li, preferably chosen from among sodium and potassium hydroxides, are also used, their concentration in the aqueous phase being preferably maintained between about 20 and 50 by weight, and in any case well in excess of the stoichiometric proportion with respect to the 1 haloqen 1 arylethane. Effective initial halides of formula II proved to be 1 bromo1 phenylethane, 1 chloro 1 6 methoxy 2 naphthyl ethane, 1 bromo 1 p.chlorophenyl ethane, 1 bromo 1 p.isobutylphenyl ethane, 1 bromo1 m chlorophenyl ethane, 1 chloro 1 phenylethane. The initial 1halogen 1 arylethane II may be introduced into the reactor either gradually or in one single batch charge at the beginning of the reaction. The reaction itself is conducted according to the known phasetransfer technique, in the presence of an onium salt chosen from among the ammonium and phosphonium salts having formulae IV and V respectively N R1 4 X IV and P R1 4 X V wherein R 4 represents a homogeneous or heterogeneous hydrocarbyl radical group containing up to 20 carbon atoms, and whereinXisahalogen as hereinabove defined. The addition of an onium , phosphonium V or quaternary ammonium IV salt, occurs according to a molar ratio of onium salt cobalt hydrocarbonyl salt catalyst comprised between about 1 1 and 3 1.These values are to be considered as practical values that are not critical with respect to the effectiveness of the reaction. Effective onium salts proved to be 1 phenyl 1 ethyltrimethylammonium iodide, phenyltrimethylammonium bromide or iodide, tetra nbutylammonium bromide, and benzyltrimethylammonium chloride, etc.Obviously, for the purposes of the reaction, it is also possible to use other onium salts or to use crown ethers being, as is known to those skilled in the art, functional equivalents with regard to the reaction itself of the phosphonium and ammonium salts of the invention. The reaction may also be conducted in the absence of onium salts, in which case however, the reaction will lead to results of a lower interest. At the end of the reaction, the reaction product is separated according to known techniques. The product obtained in the form of a salt, according to the nature of the biphasic system employed type of the solvent and concentration of the base may be found dissolved in the aqueous or organic phases, or else in the form of a precipitate. In the first case, after separation of the aqueous phase from the organic phase containing the catalyst, which is recycled, one proceeds with the acidification with HCl, H2SO4 and with the extraction by means of a solvent, etc. In the second case,the organic phase, after separation from the recyclable aqueous phase, is washed with water and then treated as previously indicated. In the third case, the precipitate is filtered, etc. and the liquid phases are recycled. Obviously, the recycled liquid phases are restored to the initial state of the composition. The process, according to an effective embodiment, is conducted in the following way. In a reactor, provided with a stirrer, and with a temperature regulating system, are introduced , under a carbon mono oxide atmospheric pressure the organic solvent, the aqueous alkaline solution NaOH , the onium salt and the catalyst or its precursor. This reaction mixture is brought to the pre established temperature and pressure, whereafter the 1 halogen 1 arylethane 11 is introduced and the mixture is then maintained under vigorous stirring at the same temperature till completion of the reaction i.e. the stopping of the absorption of CO . Thereupon one proceeds with the separation of the product as herein above described.The techniques used are essentially conventional techniques. The process, due to the simple and mild operative conditions, appears to be particularly convenient.The invention will now be described in further detail by means of the following examples given, however, for merely illustrative purpose. Examples 2, 5 and 10 have been conducted in the absence of onium salts.
