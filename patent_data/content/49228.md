# Vessel for molten metal and method of making it.

## Abstract
A holding furnace for molten metal comprises an inner vessel 32 formed of flat, rigid, heat resistant panels 37, 40, 41 . The panels are held in sealing engagement with one another at abutting edge surfaces 42A, 42B, 43 by the action of inwardly directed pressure applied to the panels by an integrally cast refractory outer vessel 34 through the intermediary of a resilient layer 33 of heat resistant fibrous material. The pressure is applied as a result of the shrinking the casting compound undergoes during the setting. When the inner vessel 32 is being made, the panels 37, 40, 41 , to which the resilient layer 33 has initially been applied, are held together by the action of a reduced pressure in the inner vessel 32 as the latter is positioned in a furnace casing 36 interiorly lined with a mineral wool insulation 35 . The inner vessel 32 then is cast around with a refractory casting compound for forming the outer vessel 34 .
