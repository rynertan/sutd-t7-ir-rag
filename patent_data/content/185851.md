# Process for producing alkanesulfonic acids.

## Abstract
A process for producing an alkanesulfonic acid is described, which comprises causing sulfur dioxide and oxygen to act on a saturated hydrocarbon under illumination with light in a substantially water free reaction system wherein photosulfoxidation of the saturated hydrocarbon is performed as a reaction mixture in the reaction system is held in contact with sodium sulfite.
