# A process for the preparation of an olefinically unsaturated ether.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of an olefinically unsatu rated ether by reacting a conjugated diene and a lower alkanol with the aid of an acidic catalyst, in which process a non basic aprotic polar solvent, such as methyl ethylketone or sulfolane, is used in order to increase the selectivity. As conjugated diene butadiene is preferred. Butadiene may be used together with isobutene, n butenes and butanes.
