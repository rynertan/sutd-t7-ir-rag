## Description
Semitrailer for container transport. The invention relates to semitrailers, more especially to container transporters, having an elongated, extendible load bed. The increasing use of transport containers has likewise led to the use of special transport vehicles, most of them semitrailers adapted to be attached to a tractor and to be released from this tractor at destination. The conventional semitrailer is supported by wheels adjacent its rear end and by a fifth wheel on the tractor to which it is connected by means of an attachment pin. while off the tractor its front is supported on frontal support jacks which are adjusted to the height required for releasing the pin from the fifth wheel. Since the standard length of containers is either 20 or 40 , the transporters are either of the short type accommodating 20 containers, or of the long type accommodating one 40 container or, alternatively, two 20 containers.In order to keep the containers rigidly attached to the semitrailer platform they are attached at their corners to so called twist locks making the use of sideboards unnecessary, therefore a semitrailer for transporting containers consists mostly of a flat platform out of which project the locking posts. Although the long type semitrailer is advantageous in that it can easily convey 20 containers to their separate destinations, its length becomes a disadvantage as soon as it has been unloaded, since it is not easy to steer a 40 trailer through dense traffic. It would, therefore, be of great advantage to provide means for reducing the wheel base of semitrailer and tractor for empty travelling, which means should also serve to contract or to extend the load bed so as to alternately carry 2O or 40 containers. In container transport it is the rule that the load should be equally distributed on the fifth wheel in front and on the trailer axles in the rear, and for this reason the attachment pin to the fifth wheel on semitrailers is positioned at the same distance from the front end as the rear suspension center is from the rear end of the platform. It is, therefore, the main object of the present invention to provide an extendible semitrailer for container transport that is adaptable to carry 40 as well as 20 containers, by respectively elongating or shortening the platform length and the distance between the twist locks at the front and the rear end. It is a further object to have the load evenly distributed on the fifth wheel of the tractor and on the rear wheel assembly of the semitrailer, both in the case of a 20 container and of a 40 container loaded thereon. The semitrailer of the present invention consists of a main body, a head portion and a tail portion, both of which are adapted to be pulled out of the main body from a locked closed position corresponding to the length of a 20 container to a locked, open position corresponding to a 40 container. The main body consists of an oblong, planar deck portion supported by lateral beams and is provided with axles, suspension means and wheels in its rear part.The two lateral beams are provided along their opposed insides with a first and a second pair of cooperating, superposed longitudinal guides, enclosing the head and the tail portion respectively. The head portion comprises a long rear portion narrower than, and of substantially the same length as the main body, and of a short front part wider than the rear part and carrying at its outer ends two container twist locks which extend upwardly above the level of the deck of the main body. The rear port is longitudinally translatable in the first pair of guides from a closed position wherein the respective rear ends of the main body and the head portion coincide and wherein the front is adjacent the front end of the main body, to an open position wherein the rear of the head portion engages overlappingly with the front part of the main body by a length sufficient to keep the two components in rigid alignment. The tail portion comprises a front part of shorter length and smaller width than the main body which is translatably supported therein by the second pair of guides, and of a rear part wider than the main body and carrying two container twist locks on opposite ends, said locks extending upwardly to at least the level of the deck of the main body. In closed position the tail portion is slid into the main body with only the rear part protruding therefrom, and in open position the two components engage overlappingly by a length sufficient to keep them in rigid alignment. In a preferred embodiment of the semitrailer the head portion is translatably carried by the upper pair of guides in the main body, and the tail portion similarly in the lower pair of guides, the latter guides extending from the rear end of the main body in frontal direction by a length corresponding to that of the tail portion. The width of the main body, the head portion and the tail portion is preferably smaller than the width of the container to be loaded on the deck of the semitrailer, and only the front part of the head portion and the rear part of the tail portion are of container width, the distance between the respective twist locks corresponding to the corner castings of the containers. For better understanding of the invention a specific embodiment of the semitrailer will now be more fully described with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein Fig. 1 is an isomeric view of a semitrailer in closed position,Fig. 2 is the semitrailer of Fig. 1 in open position,Fig. 3 is the trailer of Fig. 5 in closed position, andFig. 4 is a longitudinal section through the semitrailer in open position. With reference to the drawings which are substantially dia grammatic due to the small scale at which they are drawn a semitrailer comprises a main body I, a head portion II, a tail portionIII, and a carriage IV consisting of wheels, axles, spring suspension, brake mechanism and other accessories. The isometric drawings, Figures 1 and 2, show only one axle, but it is generally preferred to provide two axles as shown in Figures 3 and 4. The main body consists of two lateral beams 11, 11 which are on their opposed insides provided with an upper pair of through going, channel shaped guides 12, 12 and with a lower pair of shorter channel shaped guides 13, 13 . The beams are connected along their top portions by a flat deck which consists of a number of cross beams 14 and a front plate 15.The two beams are further connected in their bottom portions by threeI beams 16 which serve to reinforce the body structure. Near the rear end carriage brackets 41 support suspension springs 42 which hold axles and wheels 43 in a known manner. Mudgards 44 cover the wheels on both sides of the body. At this point it must be reiterated that only those parts are shown in the drawings that are essential for understanding the construction and the working of the semitrailer, but that all accessories have been omitted. The tail portion III consists of an oblong flat front portion running in the lower guides of the main body and of a short rear portion 32 which is wider than the front portion and carries at its both ends one twist lock 33 each, their distance correspondig to the standard width of containers and their corner castings. The front portion 31 is much shorter than the main body and in closed state enters it by about one quarter of the total length of the main body. The rear portion 32 is in the shape of a strong transverse, and in closed position it directly adjoins the rear end of the main body. The head portion consists of a rear portion 21 in the form of an oblong, rectangular and flat box of a length commensurate with that of the main body, and of a front portion 22 in the shape of an open U the arms of which extend in outward and rearward direction Two twist locks 23 are located at each of the extreme ends of the arms of the NU their distance corresponding to the distance between the corner castings of standard containers. The twist locks on both tail and head portion project slightly above the level of the deck surface of the main body preferably about 20 mm , thus supporting the containers in their four corners only, while no load is carried by any portion of the semitrailer between front and rear end. The head portion is provided on its underside with a connecting pin 24 serving to attach the semitrailer to a tractor, and with jack means 25 serving to support the vehicles as long as it is not attached to a tractor. Figures 1 and 3 of the drawings show the head and tail portions slid into the main body with only the wider parts 32 and 22 projecting out of the ends. In this position the distance between the front and the rear twist locks corresponds exactly to the position of the corner castings on a 20 container, by which it is fastened to the semitrailer. Figures 2 and 4 show the semitrailer in open state with the head and tail portions extended out of the main body to a maximum, whereby the twist locks are suitable for attachment to the corner castings of a 40 container. In Figure 4 the tail portion is shown to have been only partly pulled of the main body and not to be in the fully open position. Both positions, open and closed, are fixed in rigid connection by pins or similar means passing through cooperating openings in the interengaging components. The head and tail portions are, advantageously, pulled in or out of the main body by means of a tractor while the main body is made stationary by brakes or brake blocks. The advantages of the extendible semitrailer are self understood it lends itself to the transport of 20 and 40 containers, while in both cases the load is concentrated on the front and the rear ends only, resulting in a relatively light central structure. Owing to the fact after having transported a 40 container, it can be contracted to the length of a 20 container makes it well movable and steerable through town traffic and over narrow roads, a matter not readily obtainable with a conventional 40 semitrailer. It is only by placing the tail and the head portions into guides at different levels, that the double length can be reached. Another important point is that the load is, more or less, evenly concentrated on the fifth wheel of the tractor and the carriage of the semitrailer, whereby easy steering and correct road surface loading are obtained. It will be onderstood that the aforegoing drawings and description are in respect of one embodiment of the invention only, but that modifications and alterations may be made thereto by a person skilled in the art, without deviating from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims. It is, for instance, proposed to support the head portion in a lower pair of guides, and the tail portion in an upper pair of guides, this would, however, require a different design and con struction of the main body in a way that would be less advantageous than the present design.
