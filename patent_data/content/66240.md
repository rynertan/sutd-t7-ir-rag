# Automatic voltage regulation system for AC generator.

## Abstract
An output voltage of an AC generator 7 is produced through a full wave rectifier 14 and converted into a digital signal by an AD converter 16 . This digital signal is compared with a reference signal, and in accordance with the difference therebetween, the firing angle of a thyristor 10 is controlled to regulate the field current. Synchronous point detectors 15, 19 detect a synchronous point of the output voltage of the AC generator 7 . A microprocessor 17 computes a firing angle of the thyristor 10 in accordance with the difference between the digital signal and the reference signal and produces a signal representing the computed firing angle upon detection of the synchronous point. The thyristor 10 is fired at the firing angle computed by the microprocessor 17 .
