# Thermal economizer for domestic heating installations.

## Abstract
The air ejected from rooms and heat production points, such as kitchen escape hoods 18 , fumes of the heat production generators 15 , is intaken and let into the economizer which regenerates its enthalpic contents. From the picking up net 2 , the filtered air is first passed into a rotating recuperator and then on the evaporator of a heat pump transfering its enthalpic contents to the renewal air. This air thus preheated gets integrating thermal energy in the condenser of the heat pump and, under circumstances, also through an electrical battery. The said air is conveyed by means of the delivery net 10 to the premises at their entrance, it can be subsequently heated in an independent way by a hot water battery.

## Description
Thermal economizer for premises heating installations.The invention refers to a heating system for roans permitting to save ther mal energy by means of the Theorical recovering of The enthalpic contents of all premises.recirculation air and additionally the direct drawing from the heat production points sueh as kitchen escape hoods, fumes of heat pro duction generators, different means for producting warm water, evaporators of home refrigerators and anything similar else in This connection.The present air heating systems for premises foresee the employ of heat so urges That heat air either wholly taken in ftan outside or mixed with recir culation air after a previous depuration. These proceedings disperse a gre at part of The heat because The ejected air is warm and this heat is not recovered. Furthermore, the employ of The thermic energy at present is not foreseen which is generated on the conventional points of heat generation, getting out conventionally outwards Through pipes and ventilation grates.The invented device allows the employ of both these sources of energy which otherwise would be dispersed outwards, by conveying their flux to an economizer wholly regenerating their heating power which is transferred to The renewal air thermic energy of integration is additionally supplied by means of the heat pumpsand, if necessary, through an electrical battery.A not limiting version of execution of the proceeding and which, as such, is presented as an example, is illustrated by the drawings of Tables 1 and 2, where fig. 1 is The perspective view of the heating installation by thermoventilation in an apartment. Fig. 2 is The section of a thermoventila tion devide showing the air delivery duct putting into The distribution fal so ceiling. Fig. L is a scheme of the economizer consisting of recuperator and heat pump. Fig. 4 is The scheme of another economizer consisting of re cuperator and two heat pumps for special employ in cold climates.According to The explicative version of The proceeding, the air flux drawn fccm The premises by means of ventilator 1 is passed into duct 2 and filte red in 3, passes in a recuperator 4 of turning type and then on evaporator 5 of a heat pump, which draws the additional energetic contents before The air is ejected practically without any enthalpic contents whatever. The re newal air is intaken by ventilator 6 after having been filtered on 7, depu rated and Then preheated and partially humidified in the rotating recupera tor 4, and at last is heated in a system of heat pumps through condenser 8.This hot air can be further heated by means of electrical resistance 9. At this stage, The air preheated at The project temperature is introduced Thro ugh ventilator 6 into delivery vertical duct 10 in cycle prosecution. The rotating recuperator heat pump assembly, however is destined to meet The par tially The energy requirements of The building and of each premises unit.Its dimensioning, in fact, foresees That this system guarantees a nearly constant temperature of 15 10C. approx. in each unit, whereas the energy required for reaching higher roan temperatures is supplied to each dwelling unit in an independent way by The employ of autonomous energy sources.The said air sistem, Therefore, is foreseen autonomous centralized auto nomous for reaching and maintaining inside temperatures above 150C. and centralized up to This temperature value.In this way, Those who do not use The flat for rather long periods of time during the day, our that are satisfied with moro modest temperatures, can perform consistent savings through disposing of an air system and, therefo re, with a heat inertia null, which permits to bring the roan teNperature at any moment to higher walues in a nearly instantaneous way.All those, on the contrary, who will use the dwelling unit m e continuously and wish to maintain a constant temperature of 200 C., they will be able to do so with out being liable to sensible 1,thefts of heat since no adjacent apartment will be with an average temperature below 150C. The air impelled into each dwelling unit frsm the centralized installation is then distributed into the different roams with special ducts foreseen for This purpose by an inner ven tilation system equipped with thermic integration, the location of which is in the ceiling of the bath roan.The air coming from the central system is put by ducts 10 and 11 into the roams after having passed on the system of thermal integration 12 consisting of a fan 13 with many speeds and by a battery 14 fed with water heated by the same generator 15 foressen for pro ducing sanitary hot water. The use of the many speed ventilator, to stop during The night hours and at any rate to be controlled independently by the user, along with the system of air recirculation through duct 16 inside the dwelling unit, allows to modify the roan regimen at any moment whatever and to reach a good homogenizing of temperature and ventilation at the same time.The adoption of a thermostate, in fact, will permit to any user to choose the wished value of temperature which will be reached, maintained and paid in a quite autonomous way. With a view to pushing all energetic recuperations to the highest, the mechanical aspiration, subsequently conveyed into the bathroom false ceiling, is foreseen to have an intake, beside the one in the bathroom, also in correspondence to the hood on the cooking point in the kitchen and another on the burner of the hot water generator. Arran the false ceiling in the bathroom,the air is then extracted opening 17, the air ftom the room through the kitchen hood 18,the discharge fumes are ejected through duct 19. All that merges into duct 2 connected to the centralized economizer fitted under cover, In the case of particularly cool climates, a second heat Ixrmp is foreseen fitted on the economizer, consisting of an evaporator 20 and of a condenser 21 regenerating the enthElpic power of the outer airl In practice, the components, the shape, the materials, the nature and combo sition of the dwelling units and anything else on order may be differently and otherwise performed.
