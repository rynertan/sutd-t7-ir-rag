## Description
REAGENTS FOR DETERMINING ALLERGEN SPECIFIC IgG ANTIBODY. Allergic diseases caused by antigen antibody reactions now can be classified diagnostically by search and identification of the causal matter allergen , upon which it is possible to make a course for curative treatment. The specific IgG test reagents of the present invention can be used as diagnostic agents in identification of allergens in allergic diseases such as exogenous bronchial asthma, atopic dermatitis, immune complex disease, and the like, or as monitors for immunologically tracing clinical progress of patients. For these several decades, it has been recognized that the determination of immunoglobulin G IgG antibody against human serum allergen is very important J.W. Younginger et al., J.Clin.Invest., 52, 1268 1973 A.K. Sobotka et al., J.lmmunol., 117, 84 1976 . Recently, a radioallergosorbent test hereinafter referred to as RAST has been utilized in determination of IgE antibody specific to human serum allergen jN.F. Adkinson, Jr., AmericanSociety for Microbiology, Washington, D.C., p. 590 602 1976 .The determination of human allergen specific IgG antibody, however, has not yet been succeeded by means of RAST except only one report Shimizu et al., J.lmmunol.Hetbods, 19, 317 1978 . The reason of unsuccessful result is assumed that in RAST the binding level of non specific antibody in normal serum is greater than that of specific antibody. Hamilton and his co workers have succeeded in decreasing the non specific binding by using 126I protein A isolated from Staphylococcus aureus in place of rabbit s anti human IgG antibody J.Immunol., 122, 1073 1979 . Protein A isolated from Staphylococcus aureus preferentially binds to the Fc portion of human IgG subclass 1, 2 and 4 but not to human IgGJ. Although Protein A binds to some immunoglobulin A hereinafter referred to as IgA subclass 1 and 2, there seems no simple relationship between IgA subclass and the binding ability of protein A Brunda et al., J.lmmunol., 123, 1457 1979 . Johansson and Inganas have reported that immunoglobulin E herein after referred to as IgE isolated from a serum which contains polyclonal IgE has high affinity with protein A but the binding site different from that of IgG is not the Fc portion Immunological Rev., 41, 248 1978 . In view of the above situation, it has been greatly expected that a new method for determining human allergen specific IgG antibody is developed. The present inventors have been succeeded in producing in the mouse abdominal cavity a large quantity of monoclonal antibody which binds with a uniform affinity to the Fc site of human IgG Japanese Patent Application no. 87190 1984 .

In identifying the allergen of some allergic diseases, it is considered that the reaction medium of an allergen immobilized solid phase with a serum sample to be tested may exist in the following three conditions. a Condition in which the immobilized allergen normally reacts with the allergen specific IgG antibody. b Condition in which IgG or Ig antibody does not react with the immobilized allergen but they are adsorbed non specifically on the solid phase. c Condition in which IgG is remaining in the solution outside of the solid phase medium. In order to determining the IgG antibody in high specificity, it is desirable for the anti human IgG antibody to satisfy the following conditions since its character is important factor. tl Lower affinity with the IgG which is non specifically ad sorbed as mentioned in b . 2 Lower affinity with the IgG which is in free state in a solution as mentioned in c . 3 Very high affinity with the IgG which binds to the immobi lized allergen as mentioned in a . The reagents for determining allergen specific IgG antibody of the present invention satisfy the aforementioned conditions 1 to 3 , wherein a monoclonal anti human IgG antibody suitable for determination of IgG antibody has been employed. Accordingly, it is possible in the present invention to exactly follow up the IgG antibody binding to allergen as well as blocking antibody and reagin like IgG antibody. The reagents for determining allergen specific IgG antibody provided by the present invention are used as diagnostic aids based on enzyme immunoassay EIA , which contain an enzymelabelled, particularly, peroxidase labelled monoclonal anti humanIgG antibody hereinafter referred to as anti hIgG as main component and comprise the following components. a Enzyme labelled anti IgG reagent b Colouring agent c Substrate reagent d Reaction terminating agent e Buffering agent f Washing agent and g Diluting agent In the aforementioned components, the enzyme labelled antiIgG reagent contains enzyme labelled anti hIgG as main component and comprises the following components. a Human serum albumin b Sodium dihydrogenphosphate c Disodium hydrogeuphosphate d Sodium chloride e Anti hIgG labelled with peroxidase f Preservative small amount g Acid and or alkali proper amount Each component can be explained in more detail as follows. I Nonoclonal anti human IgG antibody The anti hIgG used in the preparation of enzyme labelled anti IgG of the present invention is a monoclonal antibody SG2 25 which was prepared by the present inventors by cell fusion Jap.Patent Application no. 87190 84 and shows the following characeristics. a To recognize the CH2 domain of human IgG. b To have high binding ability to IgGl, IgG2, IgG, Ig and Ig belonging to human IgG subclass. c To selectively bind to specific IgG antibody binding to allergen in comparison with immobilized non specific IgG anti body, while the binding ability to human IgG free in the solu tion is very weak. Example of the preparation of monoclonal antibody HG2 25 is disclosed below as Preparation . 2 Enzyme Labelled anti hIgG Anti hIgG is labelled by binding to a peroxidase, particularly, horseradish peroxidase hereinafter abbreviated toHRP . The binding of anti hIgG to HRP may be carried out in a known method for example, HRP is allowed to react with a periodate to form partially aldehyde group, to which is then bound a polypeptide anti hIgG the reduction with sodium or potassium borohydride or its equivalent reagents affords stable enzymelabelled anti hIgG complex. 3 Enzyme Labelled anti lgG Reagent The enzyme labelled anti hIgG complex prepared in the above item 2 may be preserved in a conventional phosphate buffered physiological saline PBS to which is added serum albumin. If necessary, sodium azide or Kathon CG Rohm and Haas as preservative or stabilizer may be added. Representative of components constituting are as mentioned above. The reagents of the present invention may be preserved in a condition of pH 7.0 8.0, preferably pH 7.3 7.6, more preferably pH 7.4, and a temperature of room temperature or lower, preferably 2 8 DC. The pH may be adjusted with addition of an acid such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid like inorganic acid and of an alkali such as sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate like inorganic base. 4 Colouring Agent Compounds which are coloured by oxidation with hydrogen peroxide tHa02 catalyzed by a peroxidase, for example1 leuco crystal violet LCV K Laboratory , 2,2 azino di 3ethylbenzthiazoline 6 sulfonic acid ABTS , may be employed. For example, when ABTS is used, the maximum wave length in visible absorption spectrum shifts from 350 nm to 415 nm. The amount of the colouring agent to be used is in about 0.1 1.0 mg per operation, preferably 0.4 0.8 mg. 5 Substrate Reagent As for a substrate in the enzyme reaction, 0.05 0.6 hydrogen peroxide solution, preferably 0.08 0.5X one, which contains 0.05 0.2 phosphoric acid as stabilizer, may be used in an amount of about 1.0 3.0 ml, preferably 2.0 2.5 ml per operation. 6 Reaction Terminating Agent In order to stop the enzymatic reaction after lapse of a prefixed time, 0.1 0.5 sodium azide solution is added as a reaction terminating agent. More preferably, 0.2 0.3X sodium azide solution may be used in an amount of about 1 3 ml, preferably about 1.5 2.5 ml per operation. 7 Buffering Agent The buffering agent is used in dissolving the aforementioned colouring agent or in diluting the aforementioned substrate reagent or reaction terminating agent. The buffering agent includes 0.2 0.6M solution of citric acid 3.0 8.0 and a citrate 5.0 10.0 e.g., sodium citrate, potassium citrate . If required, sodium azide or Kathon CG may be added as a stabilizer. The buffering agent, in using, is once diluted with water to about 50 fold volume, by which the aforementioned reagents are dissolved or diluted. For example, the aforementioned colouring agent is dissolved in the diluted buffer solution, and the substrate reagent is added thereto to give a substrate solution. The addition of the above 50 fold buffer solution to the reactionterminating agent affords a solution for the reaction termination. 8 Washing Agent The washing agent is used in washing of the reaction medium after termination of the antigen antibody reaction or enzymatic reaction in determination of IgG antibody, and it may usually be used after 10 50 fold dilution. The agent which is a buffer of phosphate buffered physiological saline type comprises 15 35 of sodium chloride, phosphoric acid salt e.g., 2.0 7.0 sodium dihydrogenphosphate , as well as stabilizer, 1.0 3.0S of surfactant e.g., Tween 20 and 0.05 3.0 of alkali metal hydroxide, and it may be used at pH 7.0 7.8, preferably at pH 7.2 7.6. 9 Diluting Agent The agent is used in dilution of samples collected from a person to be examined, particularly serum. The agent is 0.1 0.3M phosphate buffered physiological saline 6 12 of sodium chloride, 1.0 3.0 sodium dihydrogenphosphate, 0.1 1.0 alkali metal hydroxide, and a small amount of preservative containing about 0.05 3.0 , preferably about 1 2 human serum albumin, and it may be diluted with water to about 8 12 fold, preferably about 10 fold volume before using. If necessary, a stabilizer may be added. A group of the aforementioned reagents is used as an enzyme tracer kit in determination of the serum IgG antibody titer together with a standard kit for drawing every allergen standard curve and an allergen kit which is prepared by fixing allergen on a proper carrier. The following variety of allergens can be detected by the reagent of the present invention mite, egg white, pollen of cryptomeria Cryptomeria japonica , pollen of kamogaya inJapanese name Dactylis glomerata , pollen of mugwort Artenusua ubduca , fungi e.g., Altelnaria, Candida , cats scurf. In the allergen kit, the above allergens may be fixed on an appropriate carrier, for example, beads, plates, sheets or tubes of glass or synthetic resin. The commercially available allergen holding paper disc made by Pharmacia Diagnostic Co. may be employed. Procedure for Measurement a Reaction vessels, for example, glass or plastic test tubes, are provided. Two test tubes for the blank test, some pairs for the reference ordinarily, 10 14 tubes , and two for the sample to be tested ordinarily, serum , may be used. The fixed allergen is placed in each tube the allergen may be fixed on the inner surface of the tube . b Reference serum normally prepared by 6 repetition of 2fold dilutions or the sample to be tested is placed in the tubes and allowed to stand at room temperature with shaking or stirring. c The reference sample and the sample to be tested are removed by suction and the fixed allergen remaining is washed with the washing solution. d The enzyme labelled anti IgG solution is added to the tubes and stirred at room temperature for a period of 10 30 hours, preferably 16 20 hours. e The liquid portion in the tubes is removed by Suction, and the tubes are washed in the same manner as in c . f The substrate solution is added to the tubes and stirred at room temperature for 10 60 minutes. The operation for blank test may be started at this step. g The reaction terminating solution is added, and the mixture is stirred well at room temperature for about 30 minutes. h The absorbance of the reaction mixture in each test tube is measured at the prefixed wave length for example, when ABTS is used as colouring agent, the absorbance is measured at 415 nm. . The present invention is explained in more detail by the folloving examples and reference examples, which are not intended to restrict the present invention Example I Enzyme labelling of anti hIgG To a solution of 20 mg of horseradish peroxidase HRP SigmaChemical Co. dissolved in 5 ml of 0.01E acetate buffer pH 4.5 is added a solution of 5 mg of sodium periodate in 0.25 ml of 0.01M acetate buffer, and the mixture is incubated at room temperature for 20 minutes.The mixture is then passed through a column of Sephadex G 25 1.5 x 20 cm and eluted with O.OO1M acetate buffer pH 4.5 to give about 7 ml of eluate of activated HRP To this fraction is added a solution of 25 mg anti hIgG in 5 ml of ili carbonate buffer pH 9.5 , and the mixture is incubated at room temperature for 2 hours. Then, 2 mg of sodium borohydride NaBH, is added, and the mixture is incubated at 40C for 2 hours, applied on a column of Sephadex G 25 1.5 x 20 cm , and eluted with O.O1M phosphate buffered physiological saline hereinafter abbreviated to as PBS pH 7.4 .The resulting conjugate fractions are condensed to 5 ml, which is applied on a column of Sephacryl S 200 1.5 x 90 cm , and eluted with 0.01E PBS pH 7.4 . The eluate is condensed to 5 ml, applied on a column of Sepharose 6B 1.5 x 60 cm , and eluted with 0.01M PBS pH 7.4 . The result ing nonaggregated fractions are condensed, and the condensate is diluted with 0.01E PBS pH 7.4 containing 0.1 of human serum albumin so as to be 0.156 g g ml content this is used in prepara tion of the enzyme labelled anti IgG reagent. Confirmation of Enzyme Labelled anti hIgG To 0.05 g g ml of enzyme labelled anti lgG solution is added anti hIgG in an amount of 0, 0.025 or 0.075 g g ml, and standard curves are drawn with respective sera containing D.P. specific IgG antibody. Figure 1 shows the result. In this procedure, the solution is coloured by the enzyme reaction of HRP, and the decrease of the absorbance and the doseresponse are confirmed with increasing to the amount of anti hIgG added to the enzyme labelled anti IgG. This means that the anti hIgG binds to HRP.

Reference Example 1 Preparation of Anti human IgG Antibody Producing Hybridoma BALB C mouse 8 10 weeks of age was immunized by intraperitoneal administration of 200 g g 100 tLl of physiological saline of human serum IgG together with 100 g 1 of Freund s complete adjuvant. After lapse of 21 days, an additional 20 g g of human serum IgG was administered intraperitoneally as alum precipitate. After lapse of 3 days, the spleen was cut out, dispersed into a RPMI medium to give a cell suspension, 10 ml of which containing 108 spleen cells was mixed with a suspension of 5 x 107 NS 1 myeloma cells in 10 ml of RPNI medium. The mixture was centrifuged at 450 g for 10 minutes1 and the supernatant was removed. An RPNI medium RPNl 1640 1 ml containing 50 of PEG 4000 Nerck Co. was added thereto with slow stirring, and the mixture was then stirred for 1 minute.

The gamma fraction salted out 20 mg was dissolved in 2 ml of O.1M phosphate buffer pH 8.0 and adsorbed on a column 1.6 x 5 cm of protein A Sepharose Pharmacia AB . Impurities were first eluted with about 50 ml of 0.1M phosphate buffer pH 8.0 , and then the column was eluted with about 100 ml of 0.1M citrate buffer pH 5.0 to give the monoclonal anti human IgG antibody HG2 25. c. Effect of the Invention 1 The monoclonal antibody anti hIgG has very high specificity, by which can be detected a specific IgG antibody which cannot be detected by polyclonal anti human IgG antibody. The following experiment shows that the said monoclonal antibody has excellent specificity. Procedure A serum containing 5 U ml IgG antibody specific to bee venom was diluted with a diluting solution containing 0.5 normal human serum in order to prepare a standard solution containing 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 or 5.0 U ml of specific antibody. Each standard solution was allowed to react with a bee venom allergen disc at room temperature for 3 hours. After washing, the disc was allowed to react with an optimum concentration of l2fI labelled monoclonal anti hIgG antibody or with a commercially available polyclonal anti human IgG antibody Pharmacia AB . After washing, the radioactivity was counted, and standard curves were drawn. Result As shown in Fig 4, the monoclonal anti hIgG antibody has a very low binding rate at 0.1 U ml, which indicates that the nonspecific binding rate is low. On the other hand, the binding rate at the maximum concentration is higher than that of polyclonal antibody, which indicates that the monoclonal antibody has a high specificity. 2 The anti hIgG of the present invention exhibits a high allergen specificity and binds specifically to the aimed allergenbinding anti IgG antibody. Procedure A 200 fold diluted standard serum 100 toll containing D.P.specific IgG antibody was allowed to react with a D.P. allergen disc or with an egg white allergen disc at room temperature with shaking for 3 hours, and the D.P. allergen specific IgG antibody remaining in 50 ml of the reaction mixture was determined. Result As shown in Fig 5, the D.P. specific IgG antibody is not adsorbed on the egg white allergen disc but on the D.P. allergen disc in proportion to the disc number used. This indicates that the monoclonal antibody has an allergen specificity. 3 The anti hIgG used in the present invention very rarely binds to non specific IgG and are scarcely influenced by nonspecific IgG in determining the allergen specific IgG with a kit of the present invention. Procedure The maximum concentration of the specific IgG antibody was fixed to 1000 unit ml with the aforementioned standard serum, and this was serially diluted. The D.P. specific IgG antibody titer of the corresponding 80 samples was determined. Simultaneously, the total IgG level was determined and the correlation of them was investigated. Result As shown in Fig 6, no relationship is recognized between the titer of D.P. specific IgG antibody and the total IgG level since the correlation. coefficient r is 0.354. This means that the influence of non specific EgG on the data of the specific IgG antibody is extremely rare. 4 By using the kit of the present invention, the specificIgG antibody can be determined very precisely. Procedure Four samples I to IV in, which the content of D.P. specific G antibody is different each other and the reference sera A to F were dil. ed by a 2 fold dilution method to 50 to 1600 fold concentrations with a serum of atopic allergy patient, and they are allowed to react according to the manner as in Example 3. The absorbance was measured at 415 nm in triplicate, and the relationship between the absorbance and the dilution ratio was plotted on a log log section paper. Result As shown in Fig 7, a linear relation is recognized between the absorbance and the dilution ratio in the reference sera A to F and all of 4 samples. Those lines are parallel each other. 5 By using the kit of the present invention, the specificIgG antibody can be determined in high sensitivity. Procedure Reference serum F antibody titer 0.4 U ml was diluted to 2 to 64 fold solutions by means of the two fold dilution method and allowed to react according to the same manner as in Example 3 together with the reference sera C, D, E, and F. The absorbance was measured 5 times at 415 nm and plotted on a semi logarithmic plotting paper. The same procedure was applied to a diluted solution of NSB measured 10 times . Result As shown in Fig 8, the sensitivity in measurement corresponds to or is higher than that of 4 fold dilution solution of the reference F indicated by an arrow the absorbance of a diluting soltion is very low and quite different from that of the 4 fold dilution solution of the reference F. The C.V. in the 2 fold and 4 fold dilution solution were 7 or lower.
