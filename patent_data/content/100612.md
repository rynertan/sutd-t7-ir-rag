# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO COMPRESSED GAS POWERED AMMUNITION FOR SMALL ARMS

## Abstract
A round of ammunition comprising a missile 10, retain ing means 11 for holding the missile, and a cartridge 12 and the cartridge 12 is an assembly comprising a hollow casing 13 within an intermediate portion of which is a gas storage space 18 disposed between a hollow discharge front end portion 14 and a base rear end portion 20 of the casing, discharge valve means 30 and actuating means 60. The actuating means generally comprises servo piston means 61, servo actuating means 62 and discharge valve actuating means 63 arranged so that the means 62 is responsive to being struck by a firing pin 43 of a gun to allow the piston means 61 to utilise energy from compressed gas stored in the space to open the discharge valve means, and thus release the gas to expel the missile 10 from the retaining means.
