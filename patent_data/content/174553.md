# Method for production of silicon thin film piezoresistive devices.

## Abstract
Semiconductor piezoresistive devices can be obtained by the plasma CVD method, i.e., exposing a substrate to a plasma atmosphere produced from silicon hydride gas containing boron hydride to deposit on the substrate a thin film of crystalline silicon as a piezoresistive material. In accordance with this method, it is possible to form piezore sistive devices into IC s and also to impart excellent prop erties thereto.
