# A RACK AND A METHOD FOR STORING WHEELED CONTAINER CHASSIS

## Abstract
A side loading rack 10 for storing wheeled container chassis 12 in a nearly vertical, slightly leaning position has a framework of dividers 16 defining plural vertical slots 14 open on one or both sides for receiving a container chassis sideways in each slot. Each divider 16 includes a chassis support arm 38 which extends front to rear along an upper side of each slot. A wheel support 52 on one side of each divider 16 is positioned in a lower part of each slot 14 to support the wheels 56 of a container chassis 12 so that the chassis frame leans at a small angle from vertical against the chassis support arm 38 of an adjacent divider 16 . Corner castings 28 are positioned at opposite ends of the rack so that it can be handled in the same manner as a container. The dividers 16 of one embodiment are constructed with an upper portion, including the chassis support arms 38 , either removable from or collapsible into the lower portion of the frame means to form a compact structure for ease of handling. In the first embodiment, the wheel support 52 is a cradle like structure. The dividers of a second embodiment include opposed support surfaces inclined downwardly toward the center of the slot to support the wheels on one divider and the rear end of the chassis on the other divider. The foundation is arranged safely to provide added support to the rear end and includes lengthwise end extensions to form an extra slot between the ends of two abutting racks.
