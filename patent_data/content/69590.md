# FABRICS FOR USE IN COMPOSITE SHEETING

## Abstract
A smooth faced fabric for use for example, in the manufacture of rubberised composite sheeting suitable for printing blankets, is composed of a rigid warp knitted structure of fine man made filament yarns A, an inlaid warp of smooth, coarse man made filament yarns B and C, and a weft insertion of coarse and preferably bulked or textured man made filament yarns D. The warp inlay and weft insertion do not interlace, so that a very flat and smooth warp surfaced fabric is achieved. In making a printers blanket, the fabric may be rubberised by conventional techniques.
