# Substituted pyridine derivatives.

## Abstract
It is disclosed that aryl substituted 2,6 bis N,N di carboxyalkyl aminoalkyl pyridines in which the aryl groups are substituted with one or more electron releasing groups are an advantageous ligand for forming fluorescent chelates with rare earth metals. The pyridine moieties can be linked to target molecules, especially biologically active target mole cules to provide fluorescent tagging for use in fluoroassay techniques. The pyridine moieties are disclosed as tet raacids, as salts and as esters. Preparation processes and precursors including the corresponding aryl substituted 2,6 dicarboxypyridines as acids, salts and esters, are disclosed as well.
