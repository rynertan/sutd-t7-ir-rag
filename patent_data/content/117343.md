# Ejector for a press.

## Abstract
A reciprocating slide 50 carries a die 72 for forming a shell 44 which, after retraction of the die 72 , is lifted by a member 46 and then ejected by ejector mechanism 20 . This includes a bar 112 which slides horizontally under the control of an arm 188 extending from a shaft 188 and engaging a slot 156 in the bar 112 . The shaft 168 is given a positive angular reciprocation by a cam assembly operat ing in synchronism with a crank shaft driving the slide 50 so that the ejector bar 112 is positively driven in synchro nism with the slide 50 . The end of the ejector bar moves cyclically from a position remote from the forming station to an intermediate position wherein it contacts a shell to be ejected and then continues to move at a faster rate to eject the shell, after which it returns rapidly to its starting posi tion.
