## Description
The present invention relates to a novel peptide, a process for the production thereof, and a pharmaceutical composition containing the novel peptide as a diuretic or hypotensor. A normal regulation of the blood pressure in a human body is important for the maintenance of personal health, and various physical and humoral factors contribute to this regulation of the blood pressure. The physical factors include, for example, output, and the elasticity of the walls of blood vessels. The humoral factors include, for example, the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, catecholamines, prostaglandins, kinin kallikrein system, and natriuretic hormones including ouabain like substances. Herein the term natriuretic will denote selective excretion of sodium cation relating to potassium cation. Granules morphologically similar to granules present in peptide hormone producing cells are found in human atrium J.D. Jamieson and G.E. Palade, Moreover, a peptide consisting of 28 amino acid derived from rat atrium cordis was identified The present invention provides a new peptide having natriuretic action and hypotensive or antihypertensive action. The peptide according to the present invention is hereinafter referred to as β human atrial natriuretic polypeptide and abbreviated as β hANP . There is also provided a process for production of the peptide. Another object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition containing the peptide as a diuretic or hypotensor. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the description set forth hereinbelow. Figure 1 contains graphs showing the diuretic and natriuretic action of the β hANP. Figure 2 is a chromatogram showing an elution profile wherein β component is separated from α component during isolation of β hANP from human atrium cordis. At present, furosemide as a natriuretic agent is used for the treatment of essential hypertension. However, the structure of the furosemide is different to that of the new peptide according to the present invention. The present inventors isolated a peptide, in substantially pure form, consisting of 56 amino acid residues and having a molecular weight of about 6,000, determined the structure of the peptide and found that the peptide showed notable natriuretic and hypotensive actions. The β hANP according to the present invention has notable diuretic, natriuretic, and hypotensive or antihypertensive actions. Male rats weighing 300 to 400 grams were anesthetized by intraperiotoneal administration of pentobarbital at a dosage of 60 mg kg, and used for tests of the β hANP according to the method described in To keep the respiratory tract open, a tracheal cannula PE240 Clay Adams was inserted into the trachea. An arterial cannula PE 50 was inserted into a femoral artery for measurement of the blood pressure, and a venous cannula was inserted into a femoral vein for the administration of Ringer s solution. 1.2 ml of Ringer s solution was infused at a flow rate of 1.2 ml hour. A bladder cannula made of silastic tube with a inner diameter of 0.02 inches and an outer diameter of 0.037 inches was inserted into the bladder, and via the cannula, a urine sample was collected into a test tube. The collection of urine was carried out for 30 minutes before administration of the test compound, and every five minutes after the administration. 0.8 n mole of the test compound β hANP was dissolved in 50 µl of sterilized physiological saline with 5 µg of bacitracin, and the solution was injected into the jugular vein. The results of the test are set forth in Figure 1. As shown in the figure, β hANP shows notable diuretic and natriuretic actions. The actions of β hANP are comparable to those of α hANP, but are maintained for a period longer than that of α hANP. 0.8 n mole of β hANP provides diuretic and natriuretic actions comparable to those provided by 1.21 µ mole of furosemide, which is a known diuretic agent. However, β hANP brings about the actions more rapidly than furosemide. Repeated administration of β hANP does not stimulate production of antibodies, and does not cause anaphylaxis shock. β hANP consisting of L amino acids is gradually hydrolized in a body providing the L amino acids, and therefore shows little toxicity. Due to the higher diuretic, natriuretic, and blood pressure lowering or antihypertensive actions, and the lower toxicity, β hANP is useful as an active ingredient for pharmaceutical compositions such as a diuretic and a hypotensor. β hANP is administered at 0.1 µg kg to 1 mg kg, preferably 1 µg kg to 100 µg kg. β hANP can be administered in the same manner as conventional peptide type pharmaceuticals. Namely, β hANP is preferably administered parenterally, for example, intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, or subcutaneously. β hANP, when administered orally, may be proteolytically hydrolyzed. Therefore, oral application is not usually effective. However, β hANP can be administered orally as a formulation wherein β hANP is not easily hydrolyzed in a digestive tract, such as liposome microcapsules. β hANP may be also administered in suppositorys, sublingual tablets, or intranasal spray. The parenterally administered pharmaceutical composition is an aqueous solution containing about 0.000005 to 5 , preferably 0.00005 to 0.5 of β hANP, which may contain, in addition to β hANP as an active ingredient, for example, buffers such as phosphate, acetate, etc., osmotic pressure adjusting agents such as sodium chloride, sucrose, and sorbitol, etc., antioxidative or antioxygenic agents, such as ascorbic acid or tocopherol and preservatives, such as antibiotics. The parenterally administered composition also may be a solution readily usable or in a lyophilized form which is dissolved in sterile water before administration. β hANP can be produced by either the extraction of the β hANP from human atrium or by chemical synthesis. In the former process, human atrium is homogenized in an acidic aqueous solution such as a phosphate buffer solubion, or an acetic acid solution containing hydrochloric acid. Subsequetly, β hANP is purified according to a conventional method suitable for the purification of peptide, such as centrifugation, isoelectric point precipitation, solvent extraction, ultrafiltration, gel filtration, adsorption chromatography or high performance liquid chromatography HPLC , or a combination of such methods. In the above mentioned methods, chick rectum relaxation activity is conveniently used to select fractions containing β hANP, because β hANP has this activity. In the chromatography methods, the β hANP containing fractions can be also selected by molecular weight about 5,000 to 6,000 . Chemical synthesis is preferable for the industrial production of β hANP, in which chemical synthesis, a liquid phase method or solid phase method, or a combination thereof can be used. The solid phase method such as Merrifield s method R.B. Merrifield, J. Am. Chem. Soc. In Merrifield s method, each amino acid is protected preferably with tert butyloxycarbonyl Boc at the α amino group a hydroxyl group in tyrosine is protected preferably with 2,6 dichlorobenzyl group Cl₂Bzl a guanidino group in arginine is protected preferably with a tosyl group Tos a hydroxyl group in serine is protected preferably with a benzyl group Bzl a β carboxyl group in aspartic acid is protected preferably with an O benzyl group O Bzl and a thiol group in cysteine is protected preferably with an acetoamidomethyl gruop Acm . In the Merrifield method, first a protected derivative of C terminal amino acid L tyrosin, i.e., Boc Tyr Cl₂Bzl , is introduced onto a solid phase resin carrier, such as chloromethyl resin, and subsequently, each suitably protected amino acid is coupled to a terminal amino acid of an intermediate amino acid chain bonded to the resin, in the order of the amino acid sequence of α hNNP. After all the amino acids are coupled in the predetermined order, the protected α hANP thus obtained is removed from the resin by treatment with hydrogen fluoride, and simultaneously protecting groups other than Acm are also removed. The product is then reduced to obtain Cys The present invention will now be further illustrated by, but is by no means limited to, the following examples. Ten hours after death, 40 g of human atrium cordis was removed and boiled in seven volumes of 1 M acetic acid aqueous solution containing 20 mM hydrochloric acid for five minutes, to inactivate protease present in the atrium cordis. The boiled atrium cordis in the acetic acid solution was then cooled to 4 C, and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer to extract the β hANP. The homogenate thus obtained was centrifuged at 12000 XG for 30 minutes to obtain 200 ml of a supernatant. To the supernatant, 12 ml of glacial acetic acid was added to the concentration of 1 M acedic acid, and acetone was dropwise added in an amount of 66 of the final concentration to precipitate impurities. The mixture thus obtained was centrifuged to obtain 424 ml of supernatant containing β hANP, which was then evaporated to dryness. The residue thus obtained was dissolved in 100 ml of 1 N acetic acid, and the solution was extracted two times with 50 ml of ethyl ether to defat the solution. The aqueous phase thus obtained was lyophlized, and the lyophilisate was redissolved in 100 ml of 1 N acetic acid. The solution was then ultrafiltrated with a UM 2 filter Amicon to desalt the solution. The desalted solution was concentrated to 50 ml. The concentrated solution was applied on SP Sephadex C 25 column Pharmacia, 8.0 x 22 cm . The elution was carried out with 1 N acetic acid, 2 N pyridine solution, and 2 N pyridine 1 N acetic acid solution pH 5.0 , in that order, to obtain fractions SP I, SP II, and SP III. The fraction SP III was lyophilised to obtain 26.6 mg of lyophilisate, which was then dissolved in 1 N acetic acid. The solution thus obtained was gel filtrated with Sephadex G 25 column 1.2 x 103 cm at a flow rate of 5.4 ml hour, collecting 2 ml of fractions. Thereby, β fractions fractions No. 42 to 45 which have chick rectum relaxation activity were obtained. The elution profile is shown in Figure 2. The β fractions were combined for further purification. The combined fraction was then subjected to cation exchange HPLC in a TSK CM2SW column Toyo Soda, 7.5 x 300 mm . Elution was carried out by linear gradient with A 10 mM ammonium formate pH 6.6 acetonitrile 90 10 and B 1.0 M ammonium formate pH 6.6 acetonitrile 90 10 , after A for 12 minutes, changing the concentration of formate from 10 mM to 0.75 M for 140 minutes. A set of fractions No. 66 and 67, retention time 140 to 142 minutes with chick rectum relaxation activity was obtained. The active fractions were combined and subjected to reverse phase HPLC in a TSK LS 410 ODS SIL column 4.0 x 250 mm, Toyo Soda . Elution was carried out with A water acetonitrile 10 trifluoroacetic acid 90 10 1 and B water acetonitrile 10 trifluoroacetic acid 40 60 1 as eluents wherein the eluent A was used for 15 minutes and then linear gradient from A to B was used for 80 minutes, at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min., and pressure of 110 to 130 kg cm². A main peak was collected and 11 n mole of substantially pure β hANP was obtained. β hANP and sodium chloride were dissolved in sterile water, an ampoule was filled with 5 ml of the solution, and the ampoule was then sealed. β hANP and sorbitol were dissolved in 200 ml of sterile water, a vial was filled with 1 ml of the solution, and lyophilized, and the vial was then sealed. The composition is dissolved in 5 ml of sterile water before parenteral administration.
