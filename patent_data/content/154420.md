## Description
CARD EDGF CONNZCTOR T i r X3BLK iL CIRCUITRY The use of flexible film, i.e., printed circuitry on thin insulating material such as polyester film, to interconnect daughter cards to mother boards provides a means to achieve extremely high density interconnections. Connectors using such film are known from several patents dating back to the early 1960 s. U.S. Patent 3,102,767 is one such disclosure.Subsequently issued patents include U.S. 3,609,463 wherein a spring biased push member is utilized to urge the contacts on a flexible material against an inserted card. In this and other disclosures, e.g., U.S. 3,401,369, the card is inserted against the biased film, i.e., an insertion force is required. Workers in the field are now conceptualizing and experimenting with including zero insertion force and wipe in connectors of the above types. However there are difficulties associated with this advancement in the art, e.g., flexible film is more readily susceptible to damage, particularly with respect to the circuits printed thereon and mounting the film to the back panel or mother board at one end and to the connector at the other end. Alignment problems which are present in conventional card edge connectors are at least as big if not a bigger problem in these new type connectors. It is now intended to provide improvements to a card edge connector of the type described in the immediately preceding paragraph. These improvements simplify the aforementioned problems as well as others. A zero insertion force, card edge connector for interconnecting circuits on a circuit board and on a circuit card by means of circuits on a flexible film where some circuits thereon are attached to circuits on the circuit board and where an edge extends away from the board, characterised by a housing mounted on a circuit board with a circuit card receiving space adjacent thereto, cam support means on the housing, a cam slidably mounted on the support means, first cooperating means on the housing and on the cam for causing the cam to move laterally towards and away from the card receiving space as the cam moves parallel thereto, a cam follower having one surface for receiving an edge of a flexible film and being slidably mounted on the cam with the one surface facing the card receiving space, and second cooperating means on the housing and cam follower to prevent the cam follower from moving parallel to the card receiving space as the cam moves longitudinally but which permits the cam follower to move laterally as the cam moves laterally towards and away from the card receiving space so that circuits on an edge of a flexible film attached to the one surface will engage and disengage circuits on a circuit card in the card receiving space. For a better understanding of the invention, reference will now be made by way of example to the accompanying drawings in which FIGURE 1 is an isometric, partly sectioned view of the card edge connector of the present invention FIGURE 2 is an exploded view of one side of the connector of Figure 1 and FIGURE 3 is a sectional end view of the connector of Figure 1 showing one side open and the other side closed. Figure 1 shows a connector 10 mounted on a back panel or mother board 12. The connector receives daughter card 14 in card edge receiving slot 16 and connects the circuitry thereon to the circuitry on the board through printed circuitry on a strip of flexible film 18. The major components of connector 10 include housing 20, cams 22 and cam followers 24. If the circuitry is on one side only of card 14, connector 10 would include one housing, one cam and one follower plus certain supporting structures, not shown . The embodiment shown is for cards with circuitry on both sides and accordingly have two housings, two cams and two followers. Housings 20 are made with a channel 26 running down each side. This design enables one housing to be used for two adjacent connectors. As seen better in Figure 2, the channel defines upper and lower side walls 28 and 30 respectively, and vertical or back wall 32. Notches 34 are provided along the free edge 36 of upper side wall 28. Keying pin recesses 38 only one is shown are provided near each end of the upper side wall. The recess opens out onto edge 36 and also into channel 26 with the latter opening being somewhat elongated. The one keying pin 40 shown adjacent the recess in Figure 2 is L shaped so that one leg extends into the channel when it is positioned in the recess. Each housing is fastened to the panel or board by bolts 42 which pass through openings 44 in the two side walls and through the channel. These bolts the number is contingent upon the length of the connector which can be of any desired length have a shaft or shoulder portion 46 which is long enough to span channel 26. Housings 20 may be molded from a suitable plastic or made from metal such as steel. In the latter case, one method of providing recesses 38 is suggested in the drawings, i.e., milling out the recess and capping it. Cam 22 will now be described with continuing reference toFigure 2. The cam is an elongated, rectangular block 48 with a rail 50 on one side thereof. Two sets of camming slots are provided in the upper surface 52 of the block. One set includes two such slots, one of which is shown and indicated by reference numeral 54. These slots, which receive one leg of pin 40, have a short first parallel section 56, a short oblique section 58, and a long second parallel section 60. These slots are located adjacent each end of the cam. The second set of cam slots, again only one is shown, is indicated by reference numeral 62. These slots extend completely through block 52 and receive therethrough bolt 42, i.e., the shoulder portion 46. These slots have a first parallel section 64 which is offset from a second parallel section 66 by oblique section 68. The length of first parallel section 64 is equal to the combined length of sections 56 and 58 of cam slot 54. The reason therefor will be pointed out below. Rail 50 is thin, rectangular, and connected to the block such as to define upper and lower grooves 70 therebetween.The upper side 72 of the rail is provided with ramps 74. These ramps include a long slope 76, a flat portion 78, and a steep slope 80. Cut outs or recesses 82, having the identical shape, are provided on the lower side 84 of the rail and in precise alignment with the ramps. The ramps and recesses are spaced along rail 50 as required. Cam followers 24 may be stamped and formed from steel.These channel shaped members are formed with upper and lower side walls 86 and 88 respectively and joined by base wall 90.The free ends of each side wall are turned in as indicated by reference numeral 92. The walls define channel 93. Tabs 94 are struck from the upper side wall 86 and bent to extend upwardly. The number and spacing of the tabs correspond to the number of spacing of notches 34 in housing 20. Ramp following fingers 96 are stamped and formed from the upper side wall and are pushed into the channel defined in part by the side walls. Identical fingers not shown are provided on the lower side wall 88. Followers 24 include biasing means 98 which are secured to the inner surface of base wall 90. The preferred means are shown exploded out of the follower in Figure 2 and include an elongate plate 100 with cantilever beams 102 spaced therealong.The beams have ears 103 on the free ends and are bent into a concave convex shape with the convex surface 104 facing out of the follower. The plates may be secured to the base wall by riveting, adhesive, or other similar conventional means. An elastomeric pad 106 is secured to the outer surface of base wall 90 as shown. The preferred flexible film strip 18 for use with connector 10 is one with the circuitry embedded between insulating layers and connected to pads which project out from the surface. Such a film strip is shown in Figure 2 with the embedded circuitry shown as dashed lines and indicated by reference numeral 108.The pads or buttons are indicated by reference numeral 110. Figure 2 also includes daughter card 14 to show stop members 112 attached thereto and keying holes 114 and 116.The former is elongated while the latter is circular. Circuit pads 118 on the card provide the contact surface for pads 110 on film 18. The board 12 has similar conductive pads as is well known by those skilled in the art. At the present time, the method of assembling connector 10 includes flexible film 18. The circuit pads or circuits themselves on one edge of each of the two film strips are soldered or otherwise secured to board 12. The other edges are secured to the elastomeric pads 106 on followers 24. The cams 22 are assembled to the followers by sliding rails 50 into channels 93.The turned in free edges of the side walls catch in grooves 70.The housing is added by sliding it onto cam 22, i.e., the cam is received into channel 26. During this step lower side wall 30 on the housing is supported by the board tabs 94 enter notches 34 as shown in Figure 1. Bolts 42 are placed in openings 44 and threaded into appropriate receivers on the opposite side of the board. Cam 22 is concurrently captured in channel 26 thereby. Locating pins 40 are placed in the recesses 38 and cam slots 54 and confined by the caps. The connector halves, i.e., one housing with cam, follower and attached film, are spaced apart a distance such that a card can be inserted without engaging films 18. The right hand connector half, indicated generally by reference numeral 10 R in Figure 3, illustrates this.Stop members 112 automatically limit the insertion depth so that circuit pads 118 on the card are in line with conductive buttons 110 on film 18. The left hand connector half, indicated by reference numeral 10 L in Figure 3, shows the film pressed against card pads 118, i.e., the connector half has been closed by sliding cam 22 longitudinally along channel 26. The sequence of events is, first, keying pins 40 are cammed out into keying holes 114 and 116. The pin in the latter hole holds the card against movement in any direction. The pin in the former hole, i.e., hole 114, holds the card against vertical movement but does allow some horizontal growth or shrinkage induced by thermal forces.Due to the structure of cam slots 54 and 62, the keying pins are required in the keying holes in the card before the next event takes place. This insures that the card is held securely. The next event is caused by the interaction of cam slot 62 and bolt 42 or, more precisely, shoulder portion 46 thereon. The cam is forced to move in towards the card as indicated by arrow 120.As the buttons 110 on the film must touch pads 118 on the card, the long slope 76 on ramps 74 engage fingers 96 forcing follower 24 upwardly as indicated by arrow 122. This movement provides upward wipe. The cam moves further in, with the follower riding across the top of the ramps. With further longitudinal travel, the short slope 80 on the ramps move past fingers 96 and the beveled recess wall engages the fingers to force the follower down, dragging button 110 with it to provide a back wipe across pads 118. At this point cam 22 has been cammed in to its predetermined distance. Buttons 110 are forced against pads 118 with the predetermined amount of force which preferably is about 80 grams. Although cam 22 is moving both longitudinally and inwardly, tabs 94 on follower 24 hold it against longitudinal travel while permitting it to move perpendicularly. Elastomeric pad 106, in addition to providing insulation between the film and follower, providing compensation for variations of card thicknesses and even for thickness differences between adjacent pads 118. Biasing means 100 provide resiliency against forces attempting to introduce changes in the normal forces pushing the film against the card. Further, the resiliency compensates for variations in thicknesses of the cards. In this regard, as the cam is moving in, the cantilever beams are being pressed in until ears 103 bear against plate 100. The nature of the beams change to beams secured at both ends and require substantially greater pressure than is available to further compress them. Consequently, any relaxation in the cam is taken up by the beam returning towards its original shape and the normal forces at the contacting surfaces buttons 110 and pads 118 remain constant. Moving cam 22 longitudinally in the opposite direction reverses the aforementioned steps and the card may be withdrawn freely. The circuit card and film strips have been referred to and illustrated as having pads or buttons. This description and drawings are not intended to limit the use of the connector disclosed herein to that type of circuitry. The claims appended hereto use the term circuits . It is intended that that word be used in the broadest sense so as to include pads, buttons, traces and any other circuitry structure that is suitable for use in the connector described herein.
