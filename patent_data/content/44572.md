## Description
APPARATUS FOR MEASURING THE INTENSITY OF MAGNETIC FIELDSBY AN OPTICAL FIBERBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1 Field of the Invention The present invention relates to an apparatus for measuring the intensity of magnetic fields by means of an optical fiber, and more particularly to an apparatus for measuring the intesity or variation of the magnetic field in a small space, a space into which it is difficult to insert an electric conductive line or the like, by means of an optical fiber. 2 Description of the Prior Art In the prior art, there has been known a technique, by which the polarization plane of light propagated through an optical fiber is rotated by the Faraday effect due to a magnetic field applied in order either to maintain a high voltage or current equipment or to detect any trouble or malfunction of the device. The magnetic field detecting apparatus using light is advantageous over the measuring apparatus using an electric conductive coil in that isolation is so excellent that accurate detection can be performed without disturbing the magnetic field of the equipment. However, the measuring apparatus using the optical fiber as proposed by the prior art has a high voltage electric wire wound with the optical fiber or a magnetic field generating coil wound with the optical fiber in order to measure the magnetic field. Therefore, the labor involved in winding the optical fiber upon the wire or coil used in the eqo ment tc be measured makes the apparatus inconvenient to produce and use, and it is difficult to wind the optical optical fiber in a restricted space. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus for accurately measuring the intensity of a magnetic field in a small space by means of an optical fiber without requiring winding the optical fiber upon an electric conductive line or coil or adversely affecting other parts. In order to attain the aforementioned object, according to the present invention, there is provided an apparatus, in which polarized light is applied to a detecting coil or detector disposed in a magnetic field and made of an optical fiber thereby to measure the intensity of the magnetic field in terms of the rotation of the polarization plane at the detecting coil by the magnetic field, and which is characterized in that the aforementioned detecting coil is formed into a coil made of the optical fiber, and in that the total length of the optical fiber constructing the coil is made a multiple of an odd number of the length L, at which the birefringence intrinsic to the optical fiber is 27i. For example, if the coil is made circular, the apparatus of the invention is further characterized in that the radius R of the circle is expressed by the following Equation R 2m l L 2tL Here, the word substantially implies that a little compensation is required because strain is usually generated, if the optical fiber is bent, so that the birefringence intrinsic to the optical fiber is a little varied. Here, the birefringence intrinsic to the optical fiber has a relationship with the difference o gbetween the prbpagation constants of the two waves with linear polarization, which propagate along the perpendicular principle axes of the optical fiber, and with the length z of the optical fiber and is expressed by the product of 4 and z. On the other hand, the number of turns of the coil is sufficient if it exceeds one, and the detection sensitivity is generally improved if the number of turns is increased.Nevertheless, the number of turns is determined in relation to the size or the like of the coil actually used. With the construction thus far described, according to the present invention, it is sufficient merely to insert the coil into the space of the device to be measured, but it is unnecessary to wind the coil on the conductor, coil or the like constructing the device to be measured, whereby it becomes easy to insert and mount the magnetic field detecting apparatus in the device to be measured.Moreover, the coil constructed of the optical fiber has such a small volume , e.g. about 0.5 cm3,that it can be inserted into a remarkably small space. For example, any trouble, malfunction or the like of a transformer can be detected by inserting the coil into the space between the primary and secondary windings of the transformer thereby to detect an abnormal magnetic field, if any. The above mentioned and other objects and features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a view showing the construction of one embodiment of an apparatus for measuring the intensity of a ma netic field according to the present invention Fig. 2 is a view showing the construction of a detecting coil used in the aforementioned embodiment Figs. 3, 4 and 5 are explanatory views showing the polarization plane in an optical fiber for explaining the principle of the present invention Fig. 6 is a graph showing the magnetic fields as measured by the magnetic field measuring apparatus according to the present invention and Fig. 7 is a sectional view showing the optical fiber used in the embodiment shown in Fig. 1.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Fig. 1 is a view showing an example of the overall construction of the magnetic field measuring apparatus to which the present invention is applied. The light emitted from a coherent light source 1 is polarized by a polarizer 2 to have its wave polarized in a predetermined direction and is guided into an optical fiber 3 1.This optical fiber 3 1 is coupled to a backpass optical fiber 3 2 through a magnetic field detecting coil 4 which is formed at the end portion of the optical fiber 3 1.The light emanating from the terminal of the optical fiber 3 2 is coupled through a light detector 5 to a light receiver 6, and the detecting coil 4 is inserted into the magnetic field to be measured which will be called a magnetic field applied portion . The magnetic field is indicated by magnetic poles N and S in Fig. 1 for simplicity of explanation, but it is sufficient if there is a space in which a magnetic field exists. By holding constant the polarizing angles of the aforementioned polarizer 2 and detector 5, the polarization plane is rotated by the intensity of the magnetic field, whiie the light propagates through the optical fiber, especially, the detecting coil 4, so that the intensity of the magnetic field can be detected by detecting the rotation in terms of the light.Incidentally, the constructions of the light source 1 and the receiver 6 are well known in the art, and their detailed explanation is omitted. The present invention is directed especially to the cÏnstruction of the detecting coil 4 so that the construction of the light detecting unit should not be limited to the aforementioned example but may be different. Fig. 2 is a view showing the construction of one embodiment of the detecting coil forming an essential portion of the present invention. Midway of the transmission path optical fibers 3 1 and 3 2 rwhich are made of such an optical fiber which holds the polarization plane in a predetermined direction, the optical fiber 4,which is made of such a inateriaj as is subjected to the Faraday effect,is formed into a circle having a diameter of R, i.e., into a coil shape. The number of turns of the coil should Be at least one Zbrecuer, the radius is determined to satisfy the following Equation R 2m 1 L 2XLT wherein m 0, 1, 2, 3, . Here, letter L denotes the length at which the birefringency of the optical fiber 4 forming the coil is 2 71 More specifically, if the phase speeds of the light propagating along the two perpendicular optical principle axes x and y in the section of the optical fiber are denoted ssx and ssy , there is the following relationship between Ass ssx ssy and the length L EMI7.1 The fact that there is a difference between ssx and Sy comes from the fact that the optical fiber has different refractive indices along the aforementioned principle axes, i.e. has a birefrigency. It is usually convenient for production that the transmission path optical fibers 3 1 and 3 2 and the detecting coil fiber 4 are made of an identical fiber.Moreover, although the aforementioned embodiment is directed for simplicity of explanation to the case in which the coil is circular, this coil may be oval.Generally speaking, it is sufficient thatthe total length of the optical fiber forming the coil is made a multiple of an odd number of the length L. If the detecting coil thus made is arranged in a magnetic field H which is indicated by blanked arrows , the rotation of the polarization plane takes place in a manner corresponding to the intensity of the magnetic field by a reason which will be described in detail in the following, so that the accurate measurement can be performed even with a weak magnetic field. The principle of the present invention will now be described by the use of a straight optical fiber for simplicity of explanation. In an optical fiber having an intense polarization plane holding property, i.e., in an optical fiber in which the difference in phase speeds between the light beams propagating along tbe perendicular principle axes in a section thereof is large, the polarization plane in the fiber propagates along the principle axes if polarized light coincident with the principle axes is introduced. As shown in Fig. 3 a , the x and z axes in a plane normal to the propagation direction are used as the principle axes of birefringency of the optical fiber 3 1. In other words, if waves with linear polarization polarized in the direction of the x axis is incident, the output waves are waves with linear polarization polarized in the direction of the x axis. Haves with linear polarizations propagating along those principle axes i.e., the x and y axes become different in their phase speeds.As a result, if waves with linear polarization 7 at an angle e with respect to one of the principle axes, e.g. the x axisjare incident, the polarization condition on the section of the optical fiber is changed into a linear, oval or other polarization along the optical fiber axis z, as shown in Fig. 3 b , in accordance with the aforementioned difference in the phase speeds.These polarization characteristics vary periodically that the same linear polarization occurs at 2mr m 0, 1, 2, 3, , as shown in Fig. 3 b , if the birefringercy is denoted at , and the linear polarization at an inverse angle e with respect to the x axis occurs at 2m l 7L. The oval polarization is obtained at an intermediate location. The birefrigency of the optical fiber has a relationship with the difference between the propagation constants of the two waves with linear polarization, which propagate along the principle axes, and with the length z of the optical fiber and is expressed by d z a z.Especially, the length of the optical fiber for 2 7L is denoted at L in Fig. 3 b . Here, the fact that the Faraday effect has its apparent characteristics reduced if the magnetic field is applied to the fiber having birefringency will be described in the following. Generally speaking, if a magnetic field is applied to the optical fiber, the linearly polarized light is rotated by the Faraday effect of the material used.Here, as shown in Fig. 4, it is assumed that a uniform magnetic field having an intensity H is applied to a birefrigent fiber. The linearly polarized lights 7, 8 and 9 are rotated in a predetermined direction by the action of that magnetic field. It is assumed that the direction of rotation is clockwise and that the intensity is F radian. At this time, the linearly polarized lights 7 and 9 are rotated e F radian so that the angle of rotation is increased. At the position where the length of the optical fiber is L 2, they are rotated 6 F radian so that the angle of rotation is decreased. More specifically, at the position where the length of the optical fiber is mL, the Faraday rotation of the magnetic fields rotates the polarization plane of the light.At the position of m 2 L, the Faraday rotation acts to suppress the rotation. As a result, the highly birefrigentfiber performs a small apparent Faraday rotation. Consequently, the detection sensitivity to the magnetic field is deteriorated. if, however, magnetic fields in the opposite directions are applied at the positions of m 21 L and mL, as shown in Fig. 5, the angle of rotation due to theFaraday effect is added at every position so that theFaraday effect is integrated in the longitudinal direction.In other words, the detection sensitivity to the magnetic field becomes remarkably high. This will be explained by the use of Equations. It is assumed that the birefringency of the optical fiber is 2 at the position where the length of the fiber is L, as shown in Figs. 4 and 5. If waves with linear polarization in the direction of the x axis at z 0 are incident, the components of the electric field in the directions of the x and y axes at z L are expressed by the following Equation EMI11.1 wherein Complex Conjugate Angular Frequency of Light t Time Term and E Components of Electric Field on x,y x and Z axes at z L. Here, A and B are expressed by the use of the Faraday rotationF radian and the birefringency 2 , as follows EMI11.2 As to the symbols f appearing in the matrix of the Equation 1 , it is assumed that the upper symbol indicates that the intensity H of the magnetic field is in the direction in which the light propagates, as shown in Fig. 4, and that the lower symbol indicates that alternations take place, as shown in Fig. 5.It may be usually assumed that the Faraday angle of rotation F is less than 0.05 radian and that the following inequality holds EMI12.1 Hence, the Equation 2 can be approximated into the following Equations EMI12.2 If the Equation 4 is substituted into the Equation 1 , the output Ey ê is remarkably small in the order of F6 and is substantially zero in the construction of Fig. 4 that is to say, the upper symbol of the matrix in theEquation 1 is taken . In the construction of Fig. 5, on the contrary, the following Equation holds EMI12.3 and it is found that there is no suppression of the Faraday effect. If the combinations of applying the magnetic field alternately in opposite directions, as shown in Fig. 5, are taken N times, by the calculation EMI13.1 the following Equation is obtained by the use of the approximation of the Equation 4 EMI13.2 This fact indicates that the Faraday effect is accumulated if the number of the times of the alternate repetitions is increased. It is found from the foregoing description that there is an accumulated effect of the Faraday effect if the magnetic fields to be applied to the optical fiber are oriented in opposite directions at a frequency at which the birefringency of the optical fiber is 2n. Although the foregoing description is directed for simplicity of explanation to the case in which a straight optical fiber is used, the magnetic field actually measured is not such an alternate one as is shown in Fig. 5. However, in case the optical fiber is made circular, as shown in Fig. 2, equivalence to Fig. 5 can be obtained. Specifically, the upper half A e B C of the circle of Fig. 2 corresponds to the portions 7 and 9 in Fig. 5, whereas the lower half C 4 D A corresponds to the portion 8 in Fig. 5. Thus, a large rotation of the polarization plane can be obtained by winding the optical fiber into the coil shape so that the measurement can be performed even for a weak maqnetic field. Incidentally, although the foregoing description is directed to the case in which the upper semicircle has a length of L 2, it is generally sufficient that the length is 2m l L 2. In other words, it is sufficient that the radius R of the coil is expressed by R 2m l L 2 As is natural, incidentally, in order to perform the measurement of the magnetic field by making use of the rotation of the polarization plane of the light due to theFaraday effect, it is indispensable that the rotation of the polarization plane is not effected by any other external disturbances e.g. occasional bending of the optical fiber or fluctuations such as vibrations . Therefore, the optical fiber has to hold the polarization plane.Such a polarization plane holding fiber is a fiber which has a high birefringency, as has been described hereinbefore. More specifically, if B is equal to or smaller than 10 mm, the polarization plane is not influenced by the usual external disturbances, but is held when the radiusR of the aforementioned coil is equal to or larger than 10 mm. If, on the other hand, the optical fiber is bent, the birefringency intrinsic to the fiber is a little varied, which sometimes requires some variation of the radius R in accordance with the bending radius. Fig. 6 shows the magnetic field measured by the magnetic field measuring apparatus according to the present invention.The abscissa indicates the intensity Gauss of the magnetic field applied,and the ordinate indicates the detected output TrW . More specifically, waves with linear polarization are introduced into the optical fiber 3 1 of Fig. 1 in the direction of one of the perpendicular principle axes of the optical fiber 3 1, and the light emanating from the optical fiber 3 2 is detected by the detector 5 at a right angle with respect to that principle axis. In case the detecting coil 4 is not inserted into a magnetic field, the emanating light is completely shielded , and the output when the coil is inserted into a magnetic field and when the magnetic field is varied is detected. Fig. 7 is a section of the optical fiber used for the aforementioned optical fibers 3 1 and 3 2 and the detecting coil 4.The core 10 is made of silica doped with 12 mol of P205 and 5 mol of GeO2,the cladding 11 is made of silica doped with 4 mol of P205, and the jacket 12 is made of silica. The reason why the cladding 11 is oval is to make the core 10 birefringent. Such optical fiber can be easily realized by the modified chemical vapor deposition MCVD method which is well known in the art. The standardized frequency of the aforementioned optical fiber is 24 for a wavelenght of 0.6333 P , and the length L for a birefringency of 2s is about 63 mm. On the other hand, the radius of the detecting coil is 10 mm. In Fig. 6, the straight line A indicates the case, in which a detecting coil having six turns is used,whereas the straight line B indicates the case, in which a detecting coil having three turns is used. As is apparent from Fig. 6, the output is correctly detected with the square of the intensity of the magnetic field. Moreover, it is indicated that the output is increased with the increase in the number of turns of the coil. The present invention is not limited to the aforementioned embodiment, but the optical fiber may be any if it has such an intense birefringency effecting theFaraday rotation.
