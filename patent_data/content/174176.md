# Improvements relating to the heat treatment of fresh liquid milk products.

## Abstract
A process for the production of a liquid dairy product that is substantially free from micro organisms that would bring about spoilage during storage of the untreated product at 10 to 30 C, which process comprises the steps of a heating a liquid milk product to a temperature not exceeding 105 C, b heating the liquid milk product at a rate of at least 4.8 C per second to a temperature above 105 C and c cooling the liquid milk product at a rate of at least 8.8 C per second to a temperature below 110 C, the total time that the liquid milk product spends above 105 C being such that the B value of the complete heat treatment regime is not more than 1.01 and not less than about 0.5 and the C value of the complete heat treatment regime is not more than 0.27.
