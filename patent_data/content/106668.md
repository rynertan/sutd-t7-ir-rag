# Computer system with multiple operating systems.

## Abstract
A supervisor for data processing system capable of utilizing a plurality of operating systems includes apparatus for identifying a condition in the data processing system requiring a different operating system. A reserved memory area associated with the currently active operating system is then addressed and the register contents of the central processing unit are stored in the reserved memory area. The reserved memory of the operating system being activated is addressed and causes the address of the reserved memory of the operating system being activated, the data related to permitting the physical memory associated with the operating system being activated, contents of registers safestored in the reserve memory, and data establishing the decor of the operating system being activated all to be entered in the central processing unit. The operating system to be activated is then enabled, and execution of permitted instructions by the second operating system is begun. The physical memory locations are determined by a real address though use of a paging mechanism permitting storage of portions of the operating system in non contiguous groups of locations while isolating the memory available to each operating system.
