## Description
This invention relates to production of therapeutically active agents useful in the treatment of disease. It is almost a trite observation to note that the use of a broad spectrum of drugs to treat human and other mammalian disease is routine medical and veterinary practice. Therapeutically active agents, however, often suffer from a number of shortcomings which limit and complicate their use. A particular problem is that, after administration to the patient, a drug may be so rapidly cleared from the body by metabolic or other pathways or otherwise biologically inactivated so that only a relatively small percentage of the drug administered actually has a therapeutic effect. To compensate for this problem, it is common practice to increase the dosage of the drug and or to prolong its period of administration and or to shorten the interval between doses so that the therapeutically effective concentration of the drug in the patient is maintained for a period sufficient to achieve the desired result. These procedures are useful but have their own limitations. Increasing the dosage may be limited, for example, in the case of intramuscular administration, by the bolus which can be tolerated. Many drugs have toxic side effects which may limit the dosage duration or interval which can be safely used. In some cases, promising drugs cannot be used because side reactions are so severe that an effective therapeutic dose cannot be safely administered. The need to administer multiple small doses of a drug or to use continuous infusion techniques increases the cost of treatment and the burden on hospital personnel, and, of course, adds to the patient s discomfort. Accordingly, there exists a need for means by which the therapeutically active concentration of a drug, after administration, is maintained for a longer time. It is the normal and expected function of antibodies to complex with foreign substances to more rapidly clear them from the body. We, however, have unexpectedly found that the serum or plasma half life of a therapeutically active agent can be extended by forming a complex of the agent with a selected antibody, preferably a monoclonal antibody, which binds to the agent at a site which does not substantially impair its therapeutic activity and which extends the serum half life of the agent. Thus, as used herein, the term antibody means a monoclonal antibody or polyclonal antibodies unless otherwise specified or required by the context. The complex of the therapeutically active agent and the antibody may be formed By selecting the proper antibody for forming the antibody drug complex, the serum half life and, thus, the effective concentration of the therapeutically active agent, can be maintained European patent application no As indicated above a complex between a therapeutically active agent and a monoclonal antibody selected to bind the therapeutic agent at a site which does not materially impair its therapeutic activity but which forms a complex with the agent confers upon the agent a serum half life longer than that of the therapeutic agent alone and approaching the serum half life of the antibody. A similar complex of therapeutic agent with polyclonal antibodies selected to bind the antibody without materially impairing its therapeutic activity affords an extended serum half life. The complex comprising the therapeutic agent and either a monoclonal antibody or polyclonal antibodies having the properties noted above may be administered to a host. Alternatively simultaneous administration of the therapeutics agent and a suitable antibody preparation or an initial administration of the antibody preparation followed by administration of the therapeutic agent after the antibody has had an opportunity to distribute itself throughout the host, is contemplated. The therapeutic agents are those which are or can be made immunogenic, i.e., those for which an immune response can be obtained either directly or, in the case of a hapten, by binding the agent to a molecule which is immunogenic. Monoclonal antibodies against the therapeutic agent can be obtained by methods which are now well known to the art and which need not be described in detail. These methods generally involve immmunization of a mouse or other animal species, usually mammalian or avian, with the immunogen. Human lymphoid cells may also be obtained after immunization natural or induced or may be sensitized Polyclonal antibodies are also obtained by well known techniques. These include stimulating an immune response against the therapeutic agent, or fragment thereof, in a suitable animal host such as a rabbit or other mammal. Chickens and other avian species can also be used. Serum taken from the host is subjected to affinity purification to isolate polyclonal antibodies against the therapeutic agent. These antibodies are subsequently fractionated, if necessary, to isolate a subpopulation which complexes with the therapeutic agent without materially impairing its desirable activity. Particularly preferred are human antibodies against the therapeutic agent produced by hybridomas which, for example, are the product of fusion of a human B lymphocyte with an established mammalian lymphoid line, e.g., a human or mouse myeloma line. As used herein, the term antibody includes fragments thereof such as Fab, Fab , and Fab 2 or mixtures thereof and including mixtures with whole antibody. Such fractions may be less immunogenic in some patients and may also allow better penetration of the agent to the target site. In certain applications, the monoclonal antibody is preferably a hybrid antibody having a dual specificity, one against the therapeutically active agent and the other against another antigen, for example, an antigen associated with the disease which it is desired to treat with the agent. Among these may be mentioned tumor associated antigens such as carcinoembryonic antigen CEA , prostatic acid phosphatase PAP , ferritin and prostate specific antigen PSA . In such cases, the other specificity could be selected to bind with an agent which has anti tumor activity. For example, the second specificity could be against a toxin such as ricin or an interferon. Processes for obtaining such hybrids are disclosed in the pending patent application of J. Martinis et al., Serial No. 367,784, filed April 12, 1983, assigned to Hybritech Inc., European Patent Appln. 0 105 360 the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference. Among the therapeutic agents against which antibodies may be raised may be mentioned drugs such as adriamycin, vincristine, genomycin mitomycin C, and prostacyline toxins such as abrin and ricin and biological proteins such as the interferons alpha, beta and gamma , the interleukins, hormones such as insulin, plasminogen activators such as urokinase, streptokinase and tissue plasminogen activator, growth factors such as nerve growth factors, and platelet activating factor and, particularly the interferons, for example, alpha interferon. As used herein, the term interferon is used to include those agents having the characteristics attributed to interferons as described in The utility of the present invention is shown by the experiments described below with alpha interferon. In that regard, alpha interferon, a multi species interferon, has been shown to have a therapeutic effect in the treatment of certain malignant tumors including breast cancer, multiple myeloma and malignant lymphoma. However, it has been shown to rapidly clear from the plasma of man and animals during clinical trials. This has been compensated for by giving a high dose intra muscularly. However, the maximum dose is limited because of high dose toxic side effects. Also, the high doses used are very expensive and may elicit an immune response in a substantial number of patients treated. The following Example is given to illustrate the invention. Balb c mice were immunized with partially purified leukocyte interferon. Spleen cells from immunized mice were fused with a myeloma line either the NS 1 or SP2 0 lines to produce hybridomas. The hybridomas were screened to select those reactive with ¹²⁵I labeled interferon in a radioimmunoassay wherein the immune complexes were removed by horse anti mouse IgG bound to sepharose beads. Interferon used in immunization and screening were from the same source. Antibodies were selected for positive reactivity with interferon. Hybridomas producing the selected antibodies were cloned by limiting dilution to ensure homogeneity of the cell population. Approximately 40 anti alpha interferon monoclonal antibodies were employed to make interferon antibody immune complexes which were tested for retention of anti viral activity using the standard method described, for example, in Rubinstein, et al., Another known biological property of alpha interferon is its inhibition of cellular proliferation. In an assay system using DAUDI cells, retention of anti proliferative activity was demonstrated for alpha interferon in the presence of the IFG 252.2 antibody. These data demonstrate that IFG 252.2 also binds alpha interferon without affecting its anti proliferative activity. A Fisher rat 250 260 g was lightly anesthetized with sodium thiopental. A plastic canula was then surgically inserted into the femoral artery of the other leg. A bolus dose of alpha interferon Clone A of Goeddel et al., These results indicate that the activity of alpha interferon in the rat without added anti interferon has a two phase disappearance curve. The alpha phase has a 6.8 minute half life with a two log reduction of interferon activity in the plasma at 30 minutes. The volume of distribution is 20.8 ml. At 30 minutes a beta component to the plasma disappearance curve is identified with a 30 minute half life. At two hours essentially all of the interferon activity has been lost from the plasma. The area under the curve was 7047 u ml x min. In contrast, when the IFG 252.2 antibody is utilized to extend the half life, a single phase disappearance of activity from plasma is observed. The half life of this activity loss is 84 minutes. Twelve times longer than that observed for alpha interferon itself, with a volume of distribution of 19.2 ml, essentially equivalent to that observed for alpha interferon without added antibody. The area under the curve was 50,000 u ml x min, seven 7 times that for the free interferon. The foregoing experiments demonstrate that, by proper selection of an antibody, the serum half life of a therapeutically active agent can be usefully extended without signficant impairment of therapeutic activity. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the invention, therefore, has application in veterinary medicine and for human health care.
