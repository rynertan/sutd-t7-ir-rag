# Improved carboxylic anhydride catalysts.

## Abstract
In accordance with the process of this invention, an im proved catalyst for molecular oxidation of a hydrocarbon to form the corresponding carboxylic anhydrides is prepared by the steps of a forming a catalyst precursor by depositing on titanium dioxide solids at least a monolayer amount of at least one source of vanadium oxide, b calcining the thus formed catalyst precur sor under conditions sufficient to convert the vanadium oxide source into the oxide form, c depositing upon the calcined catalyst precursor a catalytically effective amount of at least one vanadium oxide source which is convertible into vanadium oxide upon heating and at least one metal oxide source selected from the group consisting of oxides of Sb, Ga, Ge, In, Tl, Pb, Se, Te, P und Bi, which is convertible into the corresponding metal oxide upon heating and which is reactive with V₂O₅, and d calcining the vanadium and reactive metal containing catalyst solids under conditions sufficient to form the corresponding vanadium oxide and reactive metal oxides.
