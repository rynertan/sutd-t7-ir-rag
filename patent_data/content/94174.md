# Speed correcting device for use in speed command system.

## Abstract
In a speed correcting device for use in a speed com mand system of a numerical controller, tracer controller or like apparatus in which a movable machine part is driven at a speed corresponding to a speed command value V , an error Î”V in the moving speed of the movable machine part is removed by detecting the moving speed in a state of the speed command value V being zero and by adding to the speed command value V such a moving speed that can cels the detected moving speed.
