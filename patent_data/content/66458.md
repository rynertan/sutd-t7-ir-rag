# Water soluble benzothiazine dioxide salts.

## Abstract
The water soluble lysine and arginine salts of N 12 pyridyl 2 methyl 4 hydroxy 2H 1,2 benzothiazine 3 carbox amide 1,1, dioxide have been prepared. These novel salts are useful in therapy as non steroidal anti arthritic agents, especially when administered by the parenteral route. Methods for preparing these salts from the corresponding acidic starting material and the appropriate amine base are provided.
