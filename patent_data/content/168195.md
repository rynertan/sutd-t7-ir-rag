# Improvements relating to ventilating.

## Abstract
A louvred fire ventilator for inclusion in e.g. curtain wailing or equivalent, lightweight building structures, has a lightweight, knock together frame 100 made up of tubular side frame members 102 housing control gear 150 to 158 for operating the louvre blades 108 and top and bottom frame members having inner tubular parts 106, 104 receiving force fitted plugging members 126, 124 see Fig. 7 fixed to the side frame members to join the frame together. The separate outer and interchangeable frame member parts 102d, 130, 131 are adapted with fixing beads 130c, 131c, 114d of different forms for mounting the ventilator in the cladding or glazing plane of any curtain wailing or glazing system for which it is intended. The frame members and the louvre blades are formed as extrusions, cut predeterminedly to required lengths, and the louvre blades are plugged at the ends with elastomeric plugging members 140 which mount the louvre blade pivots 142 see Fig. 21 , the elastomeric plugging members 140 having sealing lips 104c, 104d, 104g which make sealing engagement with the frame 100 . A version having a single, bottom hung, outwardly opening fire ventilation flap 159 see Fig. 22 is also described.
