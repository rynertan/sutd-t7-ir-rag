# PROCESS FOR PREPARING CHLOROSILANES FROM SILICON AND HYDROGEN CHLORIDE USING AN OXYGEN PROMOTER

## Abstract
Chlorosilanes with an enhanced hydrogen content are selectively produced in the direct reaction of silicon with hydrogen chloride at elevated temperatures by treating the silicon with a source of oxygen during the process. A process is also provided for producing selectively trichlorosilane by reacting hydrogen chloride with a fluidized bed of silicon particles and treating the silicon particles with the source of oxygen.
