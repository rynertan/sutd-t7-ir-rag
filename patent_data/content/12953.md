# Charge coupled parallel serial and serial parallel charge transfer apparatus.

## Abstract
A charge coupled dcvice having an interface for the trans fer of charge packets between a multi phase, multi level paral lel register and serial register. Clock phase distribution elec trodes SØ1, SØ2 are disposed at the interface between the serial register and the parallel register to isolate the interface ends of the phase electrodes 16, 18 of the serial register from the associated interface side of a parallel register electrode 27 . Thick oxide isolation regions 33 are positioned along the parallel register to define parallel charge tansfer channels Cl and corresponding interface charge transfer channels B1 that have substantially the same width as the parallel charge transfer channels. The interface charge transfer channels are used to pass charge packets from the parallel charge transfer channels of the parallel register to at least two corresponding phases of the serial register.
