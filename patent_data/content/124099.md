# Display panel and method of making it.

## Abstract
The method of making a display panel 10 comprising forming an assembly of a glass base plate having a set of lon gitudinal first slots in which anode electrodes are secured and having an array of cathode electrodes seated on the top sur face of the base plate and oriented transverse to the anodes. An apertured electrode plate is disposed adjacent to the base plate and its electrodes, and a face plate assembly is prepared by providing a glass plate and forming on one surface, in order, a large area electrode and one or more insulating layers, after which an apertured insulating layer is formed thereon by a pho to etching process. The face plate assembly carrying the aper tured insulating layer is assembled with the other parts of the panel, and the panel is processed to completion.
