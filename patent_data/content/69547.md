# Positioner apparatus for tape recorder heads.

## Abstract
A positioner apparatus for moving a transducer head 14 from one to another of a number of parallel tracks extending lengthwise along a recording tape 100 , including a rotary cam 16 with surfaces 116,216 defining an inclined plane, a cam follower 20, 22, 24 for riding upon such surfaces, a transducer carrier or mount 12 coupled to the cam follower, and guides 28, 30 along which the head carrier is moved by the cam and follower and which serve to index the transducer head at a number of mutually spaced but generally parallel positions extending transversely across the width of the recording tape. Preferably, the rotary cam comprises a wheel like member having an annular recess 50 around its outermost periphery, with the edges of such recess defining a pair of complementary, spaced, curved ramp surfaces whose path of curvature is concentric with that of the wheel like member itself. The cam follower preferably comprises a series of laterally spaced rollers which fit into the said cam recess and ride upon the ramp surfaces, such rollers being mounted upon pins or shafts 20 , 22 , 24 coupled to a slide or block 26 which in turn is coupled to the transducer mount 12 , certain such roller pins being mounted in fixed position to establish a reference, and at least one other being laterally movable to accurately follow the cam surface.
