# Method of baking and drying containers.

## Abstract
A baking and drying furnace supplies hot air over inverted containers, such as cans 13 , passing through the furnace along and over an elongated member 12 . The hot air enters the cans and is removed from the can interior by suction through the member so that the hot air flows along internal and external surfaces of the containers. In order to prevent cans from tumbling over or from being oscillated by a turbulent hot air produced by a downward flow of hot air along the outside of the cans and impingement of the hot air upon the member, nozzles 9 for sucking the hot air away from the surface of the passage around the cans are arranged along said member. In order to increase the force pressing the containers downwardly to prevent them from tumbling, the suction resistance of nozzles 9 for sucking hot air from within the containers is decreased, and the diameter of nozzles 9 is determined so that the difference in pressure between interior and exterior of the container is a maximum. In order to prevent a transporting belt 7 carrying the cans 13 from being displaced or levitated which can also cause the cans to tumble, the belt 7 is slidable within a groove on the member 12 and suction nozzles 9 are disposed on the bottom of the groove to hold the belt 7 in the groove.
