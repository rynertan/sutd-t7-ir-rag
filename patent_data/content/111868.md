# A MEMORY SYSTEM FOR STORING ANALOG INFORMATION

## Abstract
The non volatile semiconductor memory elements hav ing an MlS structure show a hysteresis curve in the gate voltage the threshold voltage characteristic. The con tinuously changing region of the hysteresis curve is used to operate the memory elements as analog memories. The input analog signal is applied to the gate electrode of a selected memory element after it is converted to have a voltage within the continuously changing region, to change the threshold voltage of the selected memory element. The changed threshold voltage is read out in read out operation.
