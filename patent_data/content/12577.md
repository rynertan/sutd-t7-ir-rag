# Polyarylene ester compositions and a process for their preparation.

## Abstract
Polyarylene ester compositions comprising an intimate admixture of polyarylene ester and up to about 10 weight per cent of an elastomeric ethylene 1 alkene copolymer. The compositions possess greatly improved impact resistance and reduced notch sensitivity in comparison with the polyary lene ester and exhibit improved melt flow with minimal loss in flame retardance, heat distortion resistance and tensile prop erties. The compositions are useful as molding powders and sheet extrusion compounds.
