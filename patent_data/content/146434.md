# A speaker independent speech recognition process.

## Abstract
According to this process, a speech signal is analyzed in a vector quantizer 1 in which the accoustic parameters are calculated for each interval of time of a predetermined value and are compared with each spectral template con tained in a template dictionary 2 utilizing a distance cal culation, the sequence obtained at the output of the vector quantizer 1 is compared with a word lexicon 5 memorized in a phonetic form utilizing phonetic distribution tables 3 associated with each template.
