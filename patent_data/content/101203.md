# Process for drying and consolidating a paper making web.

## Abstract
A process for drying and consolidating a paper making web so as to enhance translucency in the resulting paper. It is known to provide integral patterning by means of a dandy roll or by press marking or by embossing, but none of these known methods achieve controlled enhancement of translucency or tensile strength of paper. The invention provides a process for producing paper having at least portions with enhanced translucency in which a paper making web formed at least in part of cellulosic fibres and having a water content of at least 20 is simultaneously supported and constrained against shrinkage without preventing the release of water or water vapour therefrom, maintained at a temperature sufficient to dry the web without causing thermal degradation as it dries, and subjected across at least portions thereof to a pressure sufficient to produce enhanced trenslucency and tensile strength in the corresponding portions of the dried paper. If the portions of enhanced translucency are interconnected to form a network this will confer enhanced tensile strength on the structure of the paper.
