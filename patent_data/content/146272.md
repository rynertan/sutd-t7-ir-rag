# COAXIAL CABLE

## Abstract
A piezoelectric coaxial cable comprises a central stretch able conductor 1 , an outer electrical conductor 3 and an intermediate insulating layer 2 , preferably formed from poly vinylidine fluoride, which has been stretched and radially polarized to render it piezoelectric. The central conductor is also stretched when the intermediate insulating layer is stretched and is preferably formed from a low melting point metal which can be fused in order to allow it to be stretched. The central conductor has a relatively high tensile modu lus, e.g. at least 0.45 GPa, or no smaller than 1.65 GPa below the tensile modulus of the intermediate layer, because it has been found that the piezoelectric response of such cables increases as the tensile modulus of the central conductor increases.
