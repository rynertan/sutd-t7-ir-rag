# Stable high copy number plasmids, method for their formation and their use in protein production.

## Abstract
The problem of producing stable DNA plasmids of high copy number may be solved by selecting mutants in which an altered repressor gene leads to high copy number replication. The plasmids are modifed by placing a suitable transcriptional stop signal after an inserted heterogenous gene so that the readthrough expression of the heterologous DNA will not continue into the replication primer strand. Deletions resulting from interference with replication primer strand transcription are thereby avoided. Such plasmids may be used to produce a desired protein by introducing them into a host microorganism and allowing the host to express phenotypically its genotype including the plasmids .

## Description
STABLE HIGH COPY ME.R PLASMIDS METHOD FOR THEIR FORMATION PRODUCTIONAND THEIR USE IN PROTEIN This invention relates to molecular biology and, more particularly to a technique for increasing the levels of expression of protein products encoded by heterologous DNA in cloning vectors. Genetic change can occur randomly as a result of mutations appearing in a gene. As a result of a change in the gene, 2 corresponding change may occur in the protein which it encodes, changing the resultant properties of the organism. With the advent of recombinant DNA techniques, such genetic changes may be made deliberately by the introduction of a known nucleotide sequence from one strain or species into another. The known nucleotide sequence may be selected to confer a desired property upon the strain or species into which it is introduced. When the modified strain or species proceeds with the normal replication process, it also then duplicates the inserted sequence. A commonly used recombinant DNA technique involves breaking open the double stranded DNA of a plasmid cloning vector at a desired location where foreign DNA is to be inserted. To do this, particular types of proteins, called restriction enzymes, are typically used. Certain restriction enzymes will break the DNA at particular nucleotide sequences. If two different tyTes of DNA are severed in a similar manner, the open ends will therefore be complementary and will, under suitable conditions, stick together with the complezment2ry ends lying side by side. They may then be linked together enzymatically with ligase . This makes it possible to insert or splice a foreign DNA segment from any source into the desired location in the plasmid cloning vector. All DNA whether from microbes or from complex plants or annals, consists of the same identical set of nucleotides. Thus, when a DNA fragment derived from a foreign source is spliced into a plasmid, and the plasmid is introduced into a suitable host microorganism, the replication system of the host reproduces the inserted segment along with the DNA of the original host. Once in the host, the foreign pr heterologous DA is not only replicated from generation to generation, but also will produce protein for which it is encoded. This assumes the proper reading frame and promoters exist. The amount of protein produced by heterologous DNA as a result of recom.binat on depends, of course, on the magnitude and efficiency of the process used to exploit protein production and replication of the modified host bacteria. Another factor involved in the amount of protein produced is the amount or efficiency of protein production in each bacterium. The proportion of materials produced by heterologous DNA to that produced by the host s own DNA is typically the same from cell to cell and from generation to generation. Most plasmids exist in only one copy per bacterial cell. Some plasmids, however, exist in higher copy number than one. For example, the plasmid ColEl typically exists in 10 to 20 plasmid copies per chromosome in E. coli. With certain plasmids it is possible to increase the relative proportion of plasmidDNA in the cell by adding a protein synthesis inhibitor such as chloramphenicol or spectinomycin. Of course, this technique does not assist in the accumulation of protein, if that is what is desired. Because of the presence of inhibitor, only the DNA yield will be higher. Protein production may be enhanced by the use of so called super promoters which provide for extremely high levels of protein expression by increasing levels of messenger RNA. Such a technique has limitations, however, in the maximum rate at which the cellular machinery can operate. Work at the University of California has succeeded in isolating mutants of plasmids where copy number is much greater than normal. For example ColEl mutants have been isolated wherein plasmid copy number exceeds 10 to 20 copies per chromosome. However, use of such mutants to produce protein from exogenous DNA may frequently result in failure because of the existence of numerous deletions at important regions in the plasmids. The present invention provides an improved DNA plasmid having a site for replication origin, a gene for formation of a replication primer strand, a site for the initiation of readthrough expression, a section of heterologous DNA downstream from said expression initiation site encoded and in proper reading frame to produce a desired protein, and an altered repressor gene leading to high copy number replication, wherein the improvement comprises a suitable transcriptional stop signal located after said heterologous DNA to prevent readthrough transcription into said gene for the replication primer strand. In another aspect, the invention provides a method for increasing the capability of production of protein by heterologous DNA in a plasmid cloning vector. comprising selecting mutants of the plasmid having altered repressor genes leading to the possibility of high copy niter replication and inserting the heterologous DNA into the cloning vectors under the control of a promoter characterised in that readthrough transcription from the promoter into the replication primer strand gene of the plasmid cloning vector is disabled by interposing a transcriptional stop sequence between the heterologous DNA and the replication primer strand gene. The invention also includes a method for producing protein in a host microorganism, which protein is encoded by heterologous DNA, which method is characterised by utilizing a hcst microorganism containing plasmids in higher than normal copy number by permitting the microorganism to express phenotypically its genotype including the plasmids , the plasmids being in accordance with the invention or plasmids which have been subjected to a method in accordance with the invention. The invention will now be further described and illustrated with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein FIGURE 1 is a schematic diagram of a plasmid p3GPl2O FIGURE 2 illustrates a copy number mutant plasmid derived from the plasmid of FIGURE 1 wherein a deletion has occurred and FIGURE 3 is a schematic diagram of the plasmid constructed in accordance with the invention. Very generally, the plasmid of the invention comprises a sequence of DiA containing a site 11 for replication origin, a site 18 for formation of the replication primer strand, a site 13 for the initiation of readthrough expression, and a section 15 of heterologousDNA downstream from and under the control of the expression initiation site and encoded and in the proper reading frame to produce a desired protein. The sequence further has a disabling configuration which prevents readthrough transcription into the replication primer strand gene. The result is a plasmid of high copy number capability which is stable in that deletions are substantially avoided In constructing the plasmid of the invention, a plasmid is selected which is useful as a cloning vector. One such plasmid is shown and described byO Farrell, P. H., Polisky, B., and Gelfand, D.H. in J. Bacteriology 134 2 645 654 1978 . This plasmid contains a functional portion of the lac promoter and lac operon indigenous to the host bacteria, terminating in an EcoRl restriction enzyme site 14 in the beta galactosidase gene of the lac operon. This portion may b linked, at the restriction site 14 to a heterologous gene oriented in the same orientation and having the same reading frame such that readthrough can occur from the lac operon into the heterologous gene in the same reading frame. This plasmid pBGP120 exists in high copy number levels, approximately 10 to 20 plasmids per cell chromosome. Plasmids capable of existing at even higher copy numbers are selected by typical prior art techniques. Such techniques include titrating levels of a cloned product produced by the plasmid DNA. It has been concluded that it is typically a repressor produced by the repressor gene 16 of the plasmid itself which keeps the copy number down, rather than some positive control which provides a stimulus that maintains an elevated copy number. The present invention is preferably applied to a plasmid where a negative control system of this type is present. In this connection, reference is made to the work on PSC 101 chimeras by Cabello, F., Timmis, K. and Cohen, S.N., Nature 259 285 290 1976 . Typically, several successive screening procedures may be required to select the high copy number mutants. In other words, it is important to the invention that the characteristic of high copy number is indigenous to the plasmid itself, and is not the result of any function uniquely possessed by a particular host bacteria.In any case, the selected plasmid has an altered repressor gene 16 FIGURE 2 leading to high copy number, i.e., in excess of 10 20 per chromosome. It has been discovered that plasmids thus selected, even though existing in high copy number, almost invariably undergo undesirable deletions of substantial portions of the plasmid i.e., are unstable . In fact, loss of critical portions of the plasmid, such as the promoter which promotes translation of the inserted heterologous DNA, results in failure of the plasmid to produce the protein desired. The deleted form of the high copy number plasmid is shown in FIGURE 2. It may be seen that with the lac promoter and much of the lac operon missing, DNA inserted at the EcoRl site 14 may be replicated, but transcription can no lonc r be controlled from the lac promoter. Replication does not begin spontaneously from the origin of plasmid replication 11 shown in FIGURE 1.Rather, to begin replication it is necessary for a replication primer RNA strand to be generated.Transcription of this RNA primer strand begins at the origin 18 of the replication primer strand which is located between the EcoRl site 14 and the repressor 16.It is transcribed counterclockwise on the outer DNA strand 12 and, in the normal situation, stops at the origin of plasmid replication site 11. In reality, however, a large number of RNA primer strands are made which extend beyond the origin site 11. For replication to take place, these RNA primer strands must be processed to trim the strands and delete the extraneous material. Recent work has shown that the repressor 16 is a segment of RNA which prevents the processing of theRNA replication primer strands to trim the excess RNAs from the strands. Accordingly, replication is unable to originate at the origin site 11. This repressor RNA is made from the inner strand as viewed in FIGURE 1 in a clockwise direction, shown by the arrow 20. In the case of the high copy number mutant, this short RNA repressor has a single base mutation which, it may be hypothesized, prevents the folding of the repressor RNA in such a way as to block the processing of the excessively long primer strands. In such high copy number mutants, it is postulated that deletions in the plasmids occur as a result of readthrough transcription initiated from the lac promoter under cyclic AMP control in a counterclockwise direction as viewed in FIGURE 1 into and through the replication primer strand. The cell either loses the plasmid by not replicating it or the cell turns off the lac promoter by appropriate deletions. The direction of transcription of the lac promoter is shown in FIGURES 1 and 3 by the arrow 19.The transcription of the primer strand is in the same direction as lac and is shown by the arrow 22. Copy number alone is not enough to produce the instability, because the mutant is quite stable iso., full size in cells Where low levels of lac transcription occur. So, with the above model in mind, a new improved approach can be utilized to generate stable, full sized mutants. The new method involves termination of readthrough transcription from the regulatory and heterologous gene sequences by placementof a suitable transcripticnal stop signal after the inserted heterologous gene. This can be done using known techniques with appropriate restriction enzymes and ligase. See generally, Gentz, R., Langner, A., Chang,A., Cohen, S., and Bujard, H., Proc. Nat l. Acad. Sci.USA 78 4936 4940 i981 . Suitable transcriptional wstopw signals include the major terminator of the bacteriopha,ge fd genome.The nucleotide sequence of bacteriophage fd DNA is known. See Beck, E., Sommer, R., Auerswald, E. A., Kurz, Ch., Zink, B., Osterburg, G., and Schaller, H.,Nucleic Acids Res. 5 12 4495 4503 1978 . FIGURE 3 illustrates placement of a suitable transcriptional stop signal when the lac operon is used to provide the regulatory mechanism for the inserted heterologous DNA. It is useful to have temperature sensitive Ts copy number mutants. That is because high level production of some protein products of hetrologous DNA may have a deleterious effect on the host, cells. In temperature sensitive copy number mutants, there is a maintenance of low copy number when the host cells are grown at a permissive temperature usually relatively lower . When the product of the heterologous DNA is desired in quantity, the temperature is shifted usually increased . At this non permissive or restrictive temperatuve, the mutation manifests itself and the plasmid copy number increases, resulting in increased protein production from the plasmids. Such Ts mutants are rare, but can be found for almost any type of mutant by appropriate selection.First the location of the copy number mutant is determined by fine mapping with genetic recombination.Once the location is known, the spot is specifically mutagenized. This can be done by nucleotide alteration or by cutting out the region with restriction enzymes, strongly mutagenizing the fragment with some agents such as bisulfite, hydroxylamine or ultraviolet radiation, and replacing the fragment. The resultant plasmids are transformed into cells that overproduce lac repressor. These are then plated cver Xgal at permissive temperatures. Blue regions are removed from the culture. Then, at elevated temperatures, new blue areas that appear are temperature sensitive mutants which are picked. These mutations are generally recessive in trans.t. That means, when a mutant and a normal plasmid are put in the same cell, the altered or thigh copy number phenotypew is masked. The deleted form of the copy number mutant can exist in the same cell as the normal copy number parentaltype plasmid. This is not true of the non mutant because of the property of incompatibility.In spite of the similar mode of replication, this property is not manifested with the deleted form . When they are placed in the same cell, the copy number óf both types of plasmids, falls to normal 10 15 . Thus, it can be concluded that a diffusable product the repressor normally maintains the low copy number, but is absent or inactive in mutant form. However, it is useful to have a copy number mutant that is dominant in trans. this allows a more generalized approach in that non copy number mutant plasmids with similar modes of replication can be grown to a high copy level in hosts carrying such a trans dominant mutation. It may be seen, therefore, that the invention provides an improved plasmid capable of existing and replicating in high copy number and of giving correct expression or protein. By high copy number, it is meant typically in excess of fifty plasmids per chromosome and preferably in the range of one hundred to five hundred o greater. The plasmid thus enables one to obtain very high level production of protein from heterologous DNA. Various modifications of the invention in addition to those shown and described herein will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing description and accompanying drawings.
