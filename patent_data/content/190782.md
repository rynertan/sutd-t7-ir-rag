# DAMPING DEVICE FOR THE STRETCHERS OF MOTOR AMBULANCES IN GENERAL

## Abstract
The damping device comprises four identical articulated quadrilaterals disposed aligned coplanar in pairs, and each comprising a stretcher support table 2 and three bars 5, 8, 13 , the shortest 5 of which, disposed opposite the stretcher support table 2 , is hinged to the floor 1 at a point situated external to its own quadrilateral. Two corresponding bars 5 or 8 of one pair of coplanar quadrilaterals are connected together by a connecting rod 11 , and one of said bars 8 is caused to rock by a pneumatic damping unit 22 by way of an intermediate element 13 provided with three hinges which are connected respectively to said rod 8 , to a connecting rod connected to the table 2 , and to the rod of the unit 22 which is itself hinged to the stretcher support table 2 .
