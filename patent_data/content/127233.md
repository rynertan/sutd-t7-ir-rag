# Cutting angle adjustment mechanism for crop harvesting machines.

## Abstract
A mechanism 25, 40 for changing the cutting angle of the cutterbar 20 on a crop harvesting machine 10 , such as a mower conditioner or windrower, relative to the ground G is disclosed wherein the cutting angle can be changed while the harvesting machine 10 is being operated. This on the go adjustment mechanism includes a hydraulic cylinder 40 positioned as the top link between the frame 12 of the har vesting machine and the header 15 in which the cutterbar 20 is mounted. Changes in the length of the hydraulic cylin der 40 effect a pivotal movement of the header 15 about the lower links 27 interconnecting the frame 12 and the header 15 to change the angle of the cutterbar 20 relative to the ground G . By connecting the cutting angle adjustment cylin der 40 to the hydraulic circuit for the header lift cylinders 32 and by sizing the bore of the angling cylinder 40 such that its stroke is activated prior to activation of the lift cylinders 32 , the cutterbar cutting angle can be varied from the operator s seat through manipulation of the hydraulic control lever for the header lift system while the machine is in motion cutting crop. An adjustment bracket 50 is provided with various stop settings to control the range of the adjustment of the cutting angle obtainable through manipulation of the angling cylin der 40 .
