# Method of controlling a traffic control system and a traffic control system for use of the method.

## Abstract
A method and an arrangement for controlling a traffic control system comprising at least two measuring points located at a mutual distance along a traffic lane. In such a method and arrangement it is determined whether the speed of a vehicle detected in one of the measuring points is less than a predetermined part of a running weighted average speed of vehicles detected in at least both measuring points. This has inter alia the disadvantage that a number of alarm signals are unnecessarily generated, which does not promote the safety on the road. To obviate this it is determined in a measuring point, located downstreams in the traffic direction, of the two above mentioned measuring points, whether the speed of a vehicle detected there is less or not less than a predetermined part of a running weighted average speed, which is exclusively deter mined from the vehicle speed detected in the upstreams measur ing point of these two measuring points.
