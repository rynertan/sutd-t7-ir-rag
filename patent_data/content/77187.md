# Method of inhibiting corrosion and controlling deposition in an aqueous medium.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a method for inhibiting corrosion and controlling deposition in an iron containing aqueous medium. The method is capable of providing for the formation of a pro tective passive oxide film on the metallic surfaces in contact with the aqueous medium without resulting in unacceptable iron based deposition or fouling. Surprisingly, the method does not call for the addition of an organic phosphonic acid compound or derivative to the aqueous medium as would be normally expected due to the known iron dispersing character istics of these type compounds. The invention comprises maintaining the pH level at 5.5 or above, assuring that a certain minimal calcium or other ion level is maintained, and adding to the system an orthophosphate compound and a water soluble acrylic acid hydroxy alkylacrylate copolymer.
