# Furnace with sets of nozzles for tangential introduction of pulverized coal, air and recirculated gases.

## Abstract
A furnace in which fuel, such as pulverized coal, is burned, with the fuel and air being introduced into the furnace through tangential burners located in each of the four corners thereof and being directed tangentially to an imaginary circle in the center of the furnace. The invention will be described with pulverized coal, but is not limited to coal. Combustion gases from downstream of the furnace are recirculated back to the furnace, and are also introduced into the furnace from the four corners, in a tangential manner. The coal is introduced along with primary air to be directed at the smallest of a series of concentric imaginary circles the recirculated gases are directed tangentially at a somewhat larger imaginary circle and the secondary air is directed tangentially at a still larger imaginary circle.
