# Temperature controlled ammonia synthesis process.

## Abstract
A process for synthesizing ammonia with improved efficiency is disclosed. The increase in efficiency is achieved by regulation of the temperature of at least three catalyst beds connected in series by a combination of influent effluent heat exchange and high pressure steam generation.
