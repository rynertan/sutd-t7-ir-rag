# SOLID RUBBER TYRE

## Abstract
A solid rubber tyre for vehicle wheels is realized to comprises an annular band 1 made of a deformable material rubber, in particular, into which there is embedded a ribbon like element 5 formed in such a way as to have its generatrices substantially parallel to the axis of said band, and in such a way as to separate internally, the layers 6 of deformable material having a thickness s measured in the radial direction, that is lesser than 80 the minimum width 1 of the band itself measured in the direction of said axis said ribbon like element 5 having a thickness s lesser than 20 the said layers thickness s, with presenting when the ribbon like element is disposed in a substantially plane configuration a modulus of elasticity at least in a direction contained on the plane of the said configuration, that is at least greater than ten times the modulus of elasticity of the deformable material.
