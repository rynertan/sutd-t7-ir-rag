# Fuel burner control system.

## Abstract
A fuel burner control system with an intermittent gas pilot is utilizing a flame signal simulating circuit to provide for both dynamic as well as static safe start checking of the system. By said simulating circuit a flame simulating signal is provided to a switching circuit 35 which causes pull in of a first relay 40 . Said relay 40 is maintained in an energized state while a second relay 73 is conditioned to pull in. Conditioning is provided by a thermal time delay circuit 70, 74, 75 or by a further relay circuit. The first relay 40 is then allowed to momentarily drop out and a normal start up of the device then proceeds.
