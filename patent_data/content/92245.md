# Functional command for semiconductor memory.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus is described far initiating a se lected functional mode for a semiconductor memory circuit. The memory circuit typically operates by receiving a plurality of defined operational signals which control data transfer to and from the memory circuit. The method for initiating the selected functional mode comprises applying an active state of at least a first of the operational signals to the memory circuit followed by applying an active state of a second of the operational sig nals to the memory circuit. The timing of the second operation al signal relative to the first operational signal is not within the defined specficatian limits of the first and the second opera tional signals for conventional data transfer to and from the memory. The step of applying the active state of the second operational signal, outside the defined limits, serves to initiate the selected functional mode for the memory circuit. An exam ple of the selected functional mode is the activation of circuitry 62 which serves to apply a predetermined data state to a re dundant column 63 which can be substituted to replace a de fective primary column within a memory array. After the memo ry array has previously received a first data state and the circuit 62 is activated to apply a second data state to the redundant column 63 the memory array is read and each column which produces a second data state is determined to be a redundant column. With knowledge of the column substitution algorithm, it can then be determined which of the redundant columns have been programmed to replace specific original columns. This method can therefore determine the physical configura tion of the memory circuit despite the incorporation of redund ant elements into the primary memory array.
