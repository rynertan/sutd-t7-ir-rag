# Nickel X gold nickel X conductors for solid state devices.

## Abstract
A laminated conductor includes a lower thin film 10 of nickel X alloy or pseudo alloy deposited upon a substrate 20 containing silicon or upon a substrate 20, 19, 18 intended for use as a magnetic bubble storage device. Herein, X is selected from the elements P, B or C. Upon the film of nickel X alloy 10 a thicker film 11 of gold is deposited as the conductive portion of the conductor. On the upper surface of the gold layer is deposited a thin film 12 of nickel X alloy. Failure of the conductor because of electromigration is reduced dramat ically as compared with use of molybdenum instead of nickel alloy in the laminated structure. The nonmagnetic nickel X alloy does not interfere with magnetic fields or produce unwanted magnetic fields.
