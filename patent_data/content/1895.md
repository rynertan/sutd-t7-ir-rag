# Heteropolysaccharide, its preparation by fermentation, and compositions and complexes containing it.

## Abstract
High viscosity heteropolysaccharide composed of about 33 mannose, 29 glucose, 21 galactose and 17 glucuronic acid and also containing about 5,7 acetyl and about 4,9 pyruvate. It is produced by aerobic fermentation of a mutant of klebsiella pneumoniae. Compositions containing the heteropolysaccharide have an application in the field of paints and cements. Complexes of the polysaccharide wit dialdehydes have improved dispersibility.
