# Motor control apparatus for reel to reel tape drive system.

## Abstract
A motor control apparatus for an unbuffered reel to reel drive system including independently operable first 15 and second 16 drive motors including first 13 and second 14 sensors for detecting rotation of reels and a circuit 31 to 41 for controlling the drive motors cooperatively to maintain tension applied to a tape. The drive motor control circuit 31 to 41 controls the drive motors on the basis of a servo mechanism control algorithm and a stop lock control algorithm 39 using control signals having hysteresis curves in response to position deviation and a transport direction of the tape.
