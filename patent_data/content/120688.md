# A development system using a thin layer of marking particles.

## Abstract
An apparatus in which a latent image recorded on an image receiving member 10 is developed. A metering roller 94 advances marking particles to a developer roller 70 for transportation to the latent image. The thickness of the layer of marking particles on the developer roller is a function of the ratio of the surface speed of the metering roll to developer roll. In this way, a thin layer of marketing particles is transported into contact with the latent image to form a powder image on the image receiving member.
