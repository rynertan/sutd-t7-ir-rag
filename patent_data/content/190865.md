# Servo circuit for use with an information reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A servo circuit for use with a reproducing apparatus wherein an information signal is reproduced from a slant track formed on a tape which is wrapped on the periphery of a guide drum having a rotary head including a circuit for detecting an intermediate point of the slant track and generating a timing signal at the detection of the intermedi ate point and a circuit for comparing the timing signal with a reference pulse to generate a control signal, whereby a relative position of the slant track to the rotary head is controlled in accordance with the control signal.
