# Inlet manifold for V configuration internal combustion engines.

## Abstract
An inlet manifold 7 for both banks of cylinders of a V configuration internal combustion engine has two different lengths of tuned inlet passage between a plenum 14 and an inlet valve 3 . A first length extends from an opening 13a in one face in this case the upper of the plenum 14 . A second length extends the first length when valve 13 closes the opening 13a , passes along passage 16 around the side of the plenum remote from the cylinder 2 , and communicates with the other face in this case the lower via an opening 18 . It is possible to construct such a manifold in three parts a plastics moulding 10 defining the plenum 14 two metal pressings 8, 9 which engage each other and a third metal pressing 11 . Such a construction can be cheaper and lighter than hitherto.
