# Process for the production of polymer polyisocyanate compositions and the use thereof for making polyurethanes.

## Abstract
Novel improved polymer polyisocyanate composition made by polymerizing acrylonitrile alone or with one or more ethylenically unsaturated monomers in situ in a polyisocyanate. The polyisocyanate comprises a diarylal kylene diisocyanate a polymeric diarylalkylene polyisocyan ate a quasi prepolymer of a diarylalkylene diisocyanate or a polymeric diarylalkylene diisocyanate with an active hyd rogen organic compound having at least two active hyd rogen atoms per molcule a mixture of a diarylalkylene diisocyanate, its carbodiimide and its trifunctional trimeric cycloadduct or a mixture of two or more such polyisocyan ates, to form a highly stable dispersion of small polymer particles in said polyisocyanate. The novel compositions are highly useful in the production of polyurethane products.
