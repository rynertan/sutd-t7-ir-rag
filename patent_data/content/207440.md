# Laminate having good gas barrier properties.

## Abstract
There is described a laminate having good gas barrier properties which comprises at least one barrier layer of a modified ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer containing 0.1 to 5 mol of pyrrolidone ring containing units and 20 to 55 mol of ethylene units, with a degree of saponification of the vinyl acetate component being at least 98 mol , and at least one layer of a thermoplastic resin. This laminate is superior in drawability, and it can be made by drawing into bottles, cups, and the like which are good in clarity, appearance, and gas barrier properties.
