# ELECTRICALLY ASSISTED CYCLE

## Abstract
An electrically assisted pedal cycle is provided having a drive unit 10 pivotally mounted to a frame 16 adjacent a wheel 24, the unit comprising a drive motor 20 and, opera tively connected thereto a wheel engaging drive roller 22, the centre of gravity of the unit being arranged in relation to the pivot 12 such that the drive unit 10 hangs clear of the cycle wheel 24 when not under drive conditions. The drive unit 10 can also be used in such a way that the drive roller 22 comes into contact with the ground surface instead of the cycle wheel 24. A distinct advantage of the invention is that it does not require a clutch or other manually operated mechanism to bring the drive roller 22 into and out of engagement with either the cycle wheel 24 or the ground.
