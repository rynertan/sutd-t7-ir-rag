# Ejection seat stabilization apparatus.

## Abstract
An ejection seat is provided with fins on opposite sides which are normally stored along the seat side rails and are deployed immediately after ejection to yaw stabilize the seat as it is slowed by a drogue. The fins are mounted for rotation and are deployed such that they extend rearwardly and out to the sides.
