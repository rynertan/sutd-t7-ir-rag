# Liquid flow rate controller.

## Abstract
The controller is suitable for a liquid containing numer ous solid particles and has a casing 13, 30, 40, 62, 70, 92 in which a valve body 16, 32, 42, 50, 60, 73, 90 is slidably accommodated. Between the inner surface of the casing and the outer surface of the valve body is provided a wide space S₂ by forming some sliding projections 18, 33, 41, 51, 63a, 63b, 80a, 80b, 80c, 93a, 93b, 93c . Furthermore, at least one flexible closing member 14, 35, 78, 79 is provided between the casing and the valve body. This construction enables the valve body to move smoothly without jamming of the solid particles in the liquid in the space S₂ .
