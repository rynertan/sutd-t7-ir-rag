## Description
The present invention relates to L aminoacylases which are useful in a wide range for the production of optically active amino acids useful for foods, medicines, feeds and other industrial materials. As an enzyme which catalyzes a reaction of a N acyl L amino acid to give a L amino acid, a hog kidney aminoacylase is known as derived from an animal Methods in Enzymolozy, Vol. 2, p109 1955 . Further, it is known that such enzymes derived from microorganisms are widely distributed in various strains such as Lactobacillus arabinosus Park R.W. et al, Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 235, p3193 1960 , Corynebacterium Okuta et al, Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 13989 1974 , Aspergillus and Rhizopus families Chihara et al, Bulletin of the Agricultural Chemical Society of Japan, Vol. 21, No. 5, p304 307 1957 Solodovnikora, N. I. et al, Inst. Biosin, Belkovykh Veshchesto, Vol 1, p145 151 1972 . However, those practically employed for the industrial purposes, are restricted to fungal amino acid acylases from the viewpoint of costs. Aminoacylases which are commercially available at present, include Acylase Amano manufactured by Amano Seiyaku , Acylase Tokyo Kasei manufactured by Tokyo Kasei and Acylase I manufactured by Miles Laboratory . Conventional fungal aminoacylases such as Acylase Amano are known to hydrolyze usual amino acids, for example, N acyl derivatives such as L methionine and L phenylalanine. However, they do not act on special synthetic amino acids such as L threo N acetyl 3 3,4 dibenzyloxyphenyl serine, whereby it is not possible to obtain L threo 3 3,4 dibenzyloxyphenyl serine which is useful as an intermediate for the synthesis of a curing agent for Parkinson disease. The present inventors have conducted extensive researches on various microorganisms including known strains to obtain a L aminoacylase having a substrate profile wider than the conventional L aminoacylases, and have finally found that a certain actinomycete produces L aminoacylase S₁ and L aminoacylase S₂ each having a substrate profile wider than the conventional L aminoacylases. The present invention provides L aminoacylase S₁ derived from an actinomycete and having the following physicochemical characteristics it is a L aminoacylase which acts on a N acyl L amino acid to give a L amino acid, its substrate profile is wide, and it acts not only on a N acyl derivative of a natural L amino acid, but also on a N acyl derivative of a synthetic L amino acid, while it does not act on a N acyl D amino acid, a DL N acetyl α methylbenzylamine and a N acetyl D glucosamine, Temperature it maintains its activity almost fully at 50 Temperature its activity increases linearly up to 50 50,000 60,000 gel filtration method pI 7.00 7.70, R it is strongly inhibited by Fe , Ni , Ag , Hg and Cu , and it is activated by Co , it is inhibited by p chloromercuribenzoate, it is not inhibited by monoiodoacetic acid, and it is moderately inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetate and L aminoacylase S₂ derived from an actinomycete and having the following physicochemical characteristics it is a L aminoacylase which acts on a N acyl L amino acid to give a L amino acid, its substrate profile is wide, and it acts not only on N acyl derivative of a natural L amino acid, but also on a N acyl derivative of a synthetic L amino acid, while it does not act on a N acyl D amino acid, a DL N acetyl α methylbenzylamine and a N acetyl D glucosamine, Temperature it does not lose its activity up to 50 Temperature its relative activity increases linearly up to 60 50,000 to 60,000 gel filtration method , pI 6.38 7.42 R it is strongly inhibited by Cu , Mn , Co , Hg , Fe , Ni and Ag , it is strongly inhibited by p chloromercuribenzoate, L cysteine and monoiodoacetic acid, but it is scarcely inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetate. Now, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the preferred embodiments.

Figure 6 shows its reaction temperature optimum temperature . Figure 7 shows its pH stability. Figure 8 shows its reaction pH optimum pH . Figure 9 illustrates a comparison in the thermal stability of L aminoacylase S₁ and L aminoacylase S₂ . Firstly, the physicochemical characteristics of L aminoacylase S₁ of the present invention will be described. The enzymatic activity was measured by using N acyl derivatives of various amino acids as the substrate. The relative activity based on L N acetyl methionine being evaluated to be 100 is shown in Table 1. As is evident from Table 1, L aminoacylase S₁ of the present invention acts on N acyl derivatives of a wide range of L amino acids including special synthetic amino acids, and has a substrate profile wider than the conventional L aminoacylases. Usually, acylases act on such acyl groups as an acetyl group and a chloroacetyl group, but they rarely hydrolyze a benzoyl group. Some acylases produced by a certain group of bacteria selectively cleave benzoyl groups, but in such a case, they do not hydrolyze e.g. acetyl groups. L aminoacylase S₁ of the present invention shows a wide substrate profile for various acyl groups, and while it is most effective to cleave an acetyl group or a chloroacetyl group, but it is also effective to readily cleave a benzoyl group. A potassium phosphate buffer solution pH 7.0 of the enzyme of the present invention was treated for one hour at various temperatures, and the remaining activity was measured. As the substrate, L threo N acetyl 3 3,4 dibenzyloxyphenyl serine hereinafter referred to simply as N Ac DB DOPS was employed, and the reaction was conducted at 37 L aminoacylase S₁ of the present invention was reacted in a potassium phosphate buffer solution pH 7.0 with N Ac DB DOPS as the substrate for one hour at various temperatures, whereby the relative activity was measured in the above mentioned method. The results are shown in Table 2. Like acylases, its reactivity increases linearly up to about 50 The enzyme solution of the present invention was left to stand at 5 L aminoacylase S₁ of the present invention is most stable under a weakly basic condition i.e. at pH 7.0 9.0, and is relatively stable even at about pH 10.0. The enzyme of the present invention was reacted at a temperature of 37 The molecular weight of the enzyme of the present invention was measured by a gel filtration method of Sephadex G 100 manufactured by Pharmacia Company . The molecular weight of L aminoacylase S₁ of the present invention is within a range of from 50,000 to 60,000 Dalton. As the standard protein samples, cytochrome C molecular weight 12,500 , carbonic anhydrase molecular weight 29,000 , egg white albumin molecular weight 45,000 and bovine serum albumin molecular weight 67,000 were used. The isoelectric point was measured at 4 The relative movement of the enzyme of the present invention to bromophenol blue hereinafter referred to as BPB was measured by a disc gel electrophoresis measurement of a 7.5 polyacrylamide gel pH 8.9 . The relative movement R L aminoacylase S₁ of the present invention is added to a 0.1 M Veronal buffer solution containing a final concentration of 1 mM of various metal salts, and left to stand at 37 Like many conventional amino acylases, L aminoacylase S₁ of the present invention is activated by an addition of Co , and its activity is strongly inhibited by an addition of Ni , Fe , Ag , Hg or Cu . The enzyme of the present invention is left to stand at 37 L aminoacylase S₁ of the present invention is inhibited by p chloromercuribenzoate as a SH inhibitor, but is not inhibited by monoiodoacetic acid. Further, it is moderately inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetate as a chelating agent. Now, the physicochemical characteristics of L aminoacylase S₂ will be described. The enzymatic activity was measured by using N acyl derivatives of various amino acids as the substrate. The relative activity based on L N acetyl methionine being evaluated to be 100 is shown in Table 4. As is evident from Table 4, L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention acts on N acyl derivatives of a wide range of L amino acids including special synthetic amino acids. On the other hand, acylases usually act preferentially on such acyl groups as an acetyl group and a chloroacetyl group, but rarely hydrolyzes e.g. a benzoyl group. Some acylases produced by a certain group of bacteria act selectively on a benzoyl group, but such acylases do not hydrolyze e.g. an acetyl group. Whereas, L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention shows a wide substrate profile for various acyl groups. While it acts most effectively on e.g. an acetyl group and a chloroacetyl group, but it is also effective to readily hydrolyze a benzoyl group. A potassium phosphate buffer solution pH 7.0 of the enzyme of the present invention was treated for 10 minutes at various temperatures, whereupon the remaining activity was measured. As the substrate, N Ac DB DOPS was used, and the reaction was conducted at 37 The enzyme of the present invention was reacted in a potassium phosphate buffer solution pH 7.0 with N Ac DB DOPS as the substrate for 10 minutes under various temperature conditions, whereby the relative activity was measured by the above mentioned method. The results are shown in Figure 6. As the results show, the reactivity increases almost linearly up to about 60 The enzyme solution of the present invention was left to stand at 5 The enzyme of the present invention was reacted for one hour with N Ac DB DOPS as the substrate at 37 The molecular weight of the enzyme of the present invention was measured by a gel filtration method of Sephadex G 100 manufactured by Pharmacia Company . As the results, the molecular weight of L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention was found to be within a range of from 50,000 to 60,000 Dalton. As standard protein samples, cytochrome C molecular weight 12,500 , carbonic anhydrase molecular weight 29,000 , egg white albumin molecular weight 45,000 and bovine serum albumin molecular weight 67,000 were used. The isoelectric point of L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention was measured at 4 The isoelectric point pI of the enzyme of the present invention is within a range of from 6.38 to 7.42. The relative movement of the enzyme of the present invention to BPB was measured by a disc gel electrophoresis of a 7.5 polyacrylamide gel pH 8.9 . The relative movement R L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention was added to 0.1 M Veronal buffer solution containing as the final concentration 1 mM of various metal salts, and the reaction was conducted at 37 The enzyme of the present invention was left to stand for one hour at 37 The results are shown in Table 6. L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention is strongly inhibited by p chloromercuribenzoate and monoiodoacetic acid as a SH inhibitor, and is scarcely inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetate as the chelating agent. L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention is also inhibited by cysteine as an amino acid having a SH group. Further, conventional L aminoacylases and L aminoacylases of the present invention were compared in the substrate profiles and the thermal stability. The substrate profiles of L aminoacylase S₁ and L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention and conventional L aminoacylases were measured. The results are shown in Table 7. L aminoacylase S₁ and L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention was compared with commercially available L aminoacylases in their activity by using N acetyl derivatives of D or L methionine and L threo 3 3,4 dibenzyloxyphenyl serine as substrates. The conventional L aminoacylases were found to act only on the L derivatives, and only the enzymes of the present invention were found to be active against the special substrate such as L threo N acetyl 3 3,4 dibenzyloxyphenyl serine. L aminoacylase S₁ and L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention were compared in their thermal stability. 0.5 ml of each enzyme solution pH 7.0 was subjected to heat treatment at 60 As is evident from the above results, L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention has a substrate profile wider than the conventional acylases, like L aminoacylase S₁. While L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention has substantially the same substrate profile as L aminoacylase S₁, L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention is superior to L aminoacylase S₁ in the thermal stability. The L aminoacylase producing microorganism to be used in the present invention, may be any wild strain, variety or recombined strain obtained by cell fusion, by genetic recombination or any other genetic engineering, so long as it is a microorganism belonging to actinomycetes capable of producing L aminoacylase S₁ or L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention. For instance, as specific examples of microorganisms having an ability to produce L aminoacylase S₁, there may be mentioned Actinomyces aureoverticillatus, IMC S 0234 ISP 5080 FERM P 7216 Actinomyces bicolor, IMC S 0276 ISP 5140 Streptomyses blastmycetics, IMC S 0189 ISP 5029 FERM P 7217 Streptomyces chartreusis, IMC S 0226 ISP 5085 Streptomyces flavopersicus, IMC S 0204 ISP 5093 Actinomyces flavotricini, IMC S 0219 ISP 5152 Streptoverticillium griseocarneum, IMC S 0237 ISP 5004 Streptomyces hachijoensis, IMC S 0244 ISP 5114 FERM P 7218 Streptomyces halstedii, IMC S 0194 ISP 5068 Streptoverticillium hiroshimense, IMC S 0179 ISP 5037 FERM P 7252 Streptomyces tendae, IMC S 0168 ISP 5101 and Streptomyces toyocaensis, IMC S 0163 ISP 5030 FERM P 7253 . These strains are all known strains disclosed in literatures. Among the above strains, the strains identified with FERM P 7216, FERM P 7217 and FERM P 7218 were deposited on September 5, 1983 and the strains identified with FERM P 7252 and FERM P 7253 were deposited on September 20, 1983, respectively, at the Japanese depository Fementation Research Institute , Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Japan. As a specific example of the strain having an ability to produce L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention, there may be mentioned, for instance, Streptoverticillium rimofaciens, MH240 CPF7. This Streptoverticillium rimofaciens MH240 CPF7 is a strain isolated by the present inventors from a soil in Omiya machi, Ibaraki ken, Japan, and its micrological characteristics are as shown below. As observed under microscope, MH240 CPF7 strain has aerial mycellia extending from a branched in substrate mycellium and having cyclic branches. A chain of at least 10 spores is observed at the forward end of each aerial mycellium, but no spiralization is observed. The size of each spore is about 0.6 x 0.8 1.4 µm, and the surface of each spore is smooth. Slightly white aerial mycellia form on colorless growth, and no soluble pigment is observed. Slightly white aerial mycellia form on light yellow brown 2 gc, Bamboo growth, and no soluble pigment is observed. Slightly white aerial mycellia form on light yellow brown 2 le, Mustard growth, and no soluble pigment is observed. Slightly white aerial mycellia form on light yellow brown 2 le, Mustard growth, and no soluble pigment is observed. White or brownish white aerial mycellia form on light yellow brown 2 le, Mustard growth. A soluble pigment is present to such an extent that a slight brown color is observed. Growth is light yellow brown 2 ng, Dull Gold and no aerial mycellia form. A soluble pigment is present to such an extent that a slight brown color is observed. Yellow white or brown white aerial mycellia form on yellow brown 3 le, Cinnamon growth. A soluble pigment is present to such an extent that a slight brown color is observed. Brown white 3 ba, Pearl aerial mycellia form on light yellow brown 2 le, Mustard growth. A soluble pigment is present to such an extent that a slight brown color is observed.

Slightly white mycellia form on colorless growth, and no soluble pigment is observed. Slightly white mycellia form on colorless growth, no soluble pigment is observed. In a simple 15 gelatin culture medium incubated at 20 In a glucose peptone gelatin culture medium incubated at 27 Growth was colorless or light brown, no aerial mycellia form, and a soluble pigment is present to such an extent that a slight brown color is observed. The color standard indicated in a bracket in the above description is based on the color harmony manual of Container Corporation of America. Tests were conducted at temperatures of 20 No liquefaction was observed in the simple gelatin culture medium. In the case of the glucose peptone gelatin culture medium, very slight liquefaction started from about 14 days after the initiation of the incubation. In each of the starch inorganic salt agar culture medium and the starch agar culture medium, the hydrolysis of starch was observed after about seven days from the initiation of the incubation, but the action was relatively weak. Coagulation started after about five days from the initiation of the incubation and completed after about two weeks, and immediately peptonization started. The action was relatively weak. The formation was positive in the Tryptone yeast broth, the peptone yeast broth and the peptone yeast iron agar culture medium, and is negative in the tyrosine agar culture medium. The strain grew by utilizing D glucose, D fructose, inositol and D mannitol. L arabinose, D xylose, sucrose, L rhamnose and raffinose were not utilized. Negative. Negative. The above characteristics may be summarized as follows. Namely, the aerial mycellia of MH240 CPF7 strain have cyclic branches, and no spiralization is observed. The surface of spores is smooth. White or brownish white aerial mycellia form on light yellow brown growth in various culture media, and no soluble pigment is observed, or a pigment forms only to such an extent that a slight brown color is observed. The formation of a melanine like pigment is positive in the tryptone yeast broth and in the peptone yeast iron agar culture medium, and is negative in the tyrosine agar culture medium. The abilities for decomposing protein and for hydrolyzing starch are rather weak. Further, 2,6 diaminopimelic acid contained in the cell wall is of LL type. From these characteristics, MH240 CPF7 strain is believed to belong to genus Streptoverticillium. Further, from the investigation of analogous known strains, there may be mentioned Streptomyces rimofaciens see Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 7598 1967 . Streptomyces rimofaciens obtained from JCM was compared with MH240 CPF7 strain. The results are shown in Table 8. As is evident from Table 8, the characteristics of MH240 CPF7 strain agree very much with the characteristics of Streptomyces rimofaciens. According to the description of the mycological characteristics of Streptomyces rimofaciens in Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 7598 1967, a Czapek culture medium was used for the test of utilization of carbon sources because the strain did not grow on a pridoham gotolieve culture medium. However, in this comparative test, the two strains grew on a pridoham gotolieve culture medium, and the evaluation of the utilization of sucrose was easy. In addition, both strains produce antibiotic Destomycin, which indicates that the two strains are of the same species. Thus, MH240 CPF7 strain was identified as Streptoverticillium remofaciens MH240 CPF7 strain. MH240 CPF7 strain is deposited under accession number 8599 FERM P 8599 at the Japanese depository Fementation Research Institute , Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, Japan. L aminoacylase S₁ and L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention may be produced as follows. L aminoacylase S₁ and L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention are obtained by inoculating and aerobically culturing an optional L aminoacylase producing actinomycete strain on a culture medium containing nutrient sources. As the nutrient sources, those commonly known as nutrient sources for bacteria and actinomycetes may be employed. For instance, as the carbon source, there may be employed commercially available hydrocarbons such as glycerin, glucose, lactose, cane sugar, starch, maltose and molasses, vegetable oils such as soybean oil and cotton oil, and animal fats. As the nitrogen source, commercially available peptone, meat extract, cornsteep liquor, Corngluten meal , Pharmamedia , soybean powder, peanut powder, yeast extract, N Z amine, casein, sodium nitrate and ammonium sulfate may be mentioned. As the inorganic salt, sodium chloride, a phosphate, calcium carbonate and magnesium sulfate may be mentioned. Additionally, very small amounts of metal salts may be added, as the case requires. These sources may be employed so long as they are useful for the production of L aminoacylase S₁ or L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention. The incubation temperature may be at any level within a range where L aminoacylase S₁ or L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention is produced, preferably from 20 to 30 The pH value for the incubation may be at any level so long as L aminoacylase S₁ or L aminoacylase S₂ is produced, but preferably within a range of pH 7.0 8.0. L aminoacylase S₁ and L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention are likely to be discharged out of the cells, and exist mainly in the culture medium. Accordingly, as opposed to the preparation of other common fungal L aminoacylases, in the case of L aminoacylase S₁ and L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention, the respective filtered culture media may be employed by themselves as enzyme solutions without destroying the cells and extracting the enzymes therefrom. Further, if necessary, the enzymes of the present invention can be purified by usual biochemical methods. Namely, they may be purified by a proper combination of methods such an ammonium sulfate precipitation method, a membrane concentration method, a Column lite manufactured by Fuji Chemical Company chromatography, an ion exchange chromatography, a gel chromatography and an electrophoresis. Now, the present invention will be described in further detail with reference to Examples. However, it should be understood that the present invention is by no means restricted by these specific Examples.

By passing 200 ml of the above buffer solution, the column was washed with the buffer solution, and then by increasing the concentration of the buffer solution linearly up to 0.5 M, L aminoacylase S₁ was eluted. L aminoacylase S₁ of the present invention was eluted with a 0.2 0.3 M potassium phosphate buffer solution pH 7.0 , and the active fractions were collected and subjected to dialysis against a 5 mM potassium phosphate buffer solution pH 7.0, 5 The enzyme solution purified by Example 2 can further be purified by e.g. an ion exchange Sephadex. Namely, the enzyme solution was passed through a column inner diameter 3.0 cm, height 25.0 cm of CM Sephadex C 50 manufactured by Pharmacia Company which was preliminarily equilibrated with a 5 mM potassium phosphate buffer solution, whereby L aminoacylase S₁ was adsorbed. The column was washed by passing 800 ml of the above buffer solution, and then the active enzyme fractions were eluted by increasing the concentration of the buffer solution linearly.

With respect to the purified enzyme obtained in Example 4, gel filtration was conducted by using Sephadex G 100 manufactured by Pharmacia Company . 0.2 mg calculated as albumin of the purified enzyme obtained in Example 4 and 1.0 ml of a 0.5 glycerol solution containing 0.5 1 mg of one of various protein standard samples, were passed through a column inner diameter 1.7 cm, height 81.5 cm of Sephadex G 100 which was preliminarily equilibrated with a 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer solution. The eluate was collected in portions of 2.0 ml by fraction collectors by passing the above buffer solution at flow rate of 3.6 ml hr. The enzymatic activity was determined by the quantitative analysis of the protein by a Lowry method of absorbance at 280 nm and the enzymatic activity. From the result of the gel chromatography, the purified enzyme was found to be a single protein band, and the molecular weight was found to be from 50,000 to 60,000 because it was eluted in about 1.4 times the void volume. Streptoverticillium rimofaciens MH240 CPF7 strain i.e. the L aminoacylase S₂ producing strain of the present invention, was inoculated under a sterile condition to 100 ml of a sterilized culture medium in a 500 ml of Erlenmeyer flask containing 3 of glucose, 1.5 of Pharmamedia , 0.3 of sodium chloride, 0.1 of magnesium sulfate, 0.007 of copper sulfate, 0.0001 of ferrous sulfate, 0.0008 of manganese chloride and 0.0002 of zinc sulfate, and incubated at 27 The culture filtrate thus obtained was passed through a column packed with 2 ℓ of Column lite manufactured by Fuji Chemical Company which was preliminarily equilibrated with a 5 mM potassium phosphate buffer solution pH 7.0 , whereby L aminoacylase S₂ was adsorbed. The columm was washed with 7 ℓ of water, and L aminoacylase S₂ was eluted with 5 ℓ of a 0.5 M potassium phosphate buffer solution pH 7.0 . The active fractions were collected to obtain 1.95 ℓ of a crude enzyme solution. This crude enzyme solution had active units of 1.69 x 10⁵ units, and the overall recovery rate was at least 95 . The activity of this enzyme was determined by reacting it to L threo N acetyl 3 3,4 dibenzyloxyphenyl serine as the substrate and measuring the resulting L threo 3 3,4 dibenzyloxyphenyl serine by a ninhydrin method. Namely, the substrate and the enzyme solution were added to a 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer solution pH 7.0 and reacted at 37 The activity of L aminoacylase S₂ giving the L threo 3 3,4 dibenzyloxyphenyl serine concentration of 100 µg ml is defined to be 1 unit. 540 g of ammonium sulfate was added to 1.95 ℓ of the crude enzyme solution 1.69 x 10⁵ units obtained in Example 6 to obtain a 45 saturated solution. The solution was passed through a column inner diameter 2.5 cm, height 25 cm packed with Toyopearl HW 65 manufactured by Toyo Soda Manufacturing Co., Ltd. which was preliminarily equilibrated with a 45 saturated ammonium sulfate solution, whereby L aminoacylase S₂ was adsorbed. Then, the column was washed with a 45 saturated ammonium sulfate solution, and then L aminoacylase S₂ was eluted by passing a 35 saturated ammonium sulfate solution and then passing a 25 saturated ammonium sulfate solution. The active fractions were collected and subjected to dialysis against a 2 mM tris hydrochloric acid buffer solution pH 8.2 to obtain 440 ml of a purified enzyme solution yield at least 95 . The enzyme solution obtained in Example 7 was passed through a column inner diameter 2 cm, height 21.5 cm of DEAE Toyopearl 650 M manufactured by Toyo Soda Manufacturing Co., Ltd. which was preliminarily equilibrated with a 2 mM tris hydrochloric acid buffer solution pH 8.2 , whereby L aminoacylase S₂ was adsorbed. Then, L aminoacylase S₂ was eluted by increasing the concentration of the tris hydrochloric buffer solution pH 8.2 from 5 mM to 200 mM linearly. The active fractions were collected to obtain 84 ml of a purified enzyme solution 7.7 x 10⁴ units yield 59 . 84 ml of the purified enzyme solution specific activity 7.7 x 10⁴ units obtained in Example 8 was subjected to dialysis against water, and then passed through a column inner diameter 2 cm, height 28 cm of CM Toyopearl 650 M manufactured by Toyo Soda Manufacturing Co., Ltd. which was preliminarily equilibrated with a 5 mM potassium phosphate buffer solution pH 7.0 . 60.9 g of ammonium sulfate was added to 215 ml of the eluate passed through the CM Toyopearl 650 M column, and the mixture was passed through a column inner diameter 2 cm, height 45 cm of Toyopearl HW 56 manufactured by Toyo Soda Manufacturing Co., Ltd. which was preliminarily equilibrated with a 45 saturated ammonium sulfate solution, whereby L aminoacylase S₂ was adsorbed. Then, L aminoacylase S₂ was eluted by decreasing the concentration of the ammonium sulfate solution linearly. The active fractions were collected and subjected to dialysis against a 5 mM tris hydrochloric acid buffer solution pH 8.2 to obtain 105 ml of a purified enzyme solution specific activity 2323 units 280 nm absorbance yield 46 . L aminoacylase S₁ and L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention can be produced in large amounts by the respective aminoacylase producing strains in inexpensive culture media. Yet, they are discharged out of the microbial cells, whereby the culture filtrates can by themselves be used as enzyme solutions without requiring any special extraction operations. Further, particularly L aminoacylase S₂ has a wide substrate profile and excellent heat resistance, and it is useful for optical resolution of not only natural amino acids but also synthetic amino acids. In addition, in such operation, there is no need for special means to prevent the contamination with microorganisms, and it is possible to increase the substrate concentration. For example, by utilizing the characteristics of the enzymes of the present invention, the production of L amino acids from N acyl L amino acids and the optical resolution of N acyl D,L amino acids can readily be conducted on an industrial scale. Accordingly, by using L aminoacylase S₁ or L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention, the simplification and improvement in the efficiency of the industrial process for the production of optically active amino acids will be possible. Further, L aminoacylase S₁ and L aminoacylase S₂ of the present invention have wider substrate profiles than the conventional L aminoacylases. For instance, when L aminoacylases of the present invention are acted on DL threo N acetyl 3 3,4 dibenzyloxyphenyl serine to which Acylase Amano i.e. typical conventional acylase is not active, the enzymes of the present invention selectively hydrolyze acetyl amino groups of only the L form of the compound, whereby it is possible to obtain L threo 3 3,4 dibenzyloxyphenyl serine which is an intermediate for the synthesis of L threo 3 3,4 dihydroxyphenyl N methylserine useful as a curing agent for the Parkinson disease.
