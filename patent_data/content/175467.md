# Gas chromatograph mass spectrometer interface.

## Abstract
Metal tape 12 is transported through a sample housing 48 from reel 14 to reel 16. Effluent from the gas chromato graph enters through vacuum connector 40 and the sample components are frozen onto the tape 12 while the carrier gas is removed through pump 34. The tape is kept cold by immers ing the cassette 8 in liquid nitrogen. The housing 48 can be kept warm by heater 52 to prevent desposition of sample on the housing. A purge gas is introduced through valve 30 to prevent contamination by the carrier gas. For transfer of the sample components to a mass spec trometer the valve 30 is closed and the housing pumped out to a high vacuum. The heater 52 is then used to evaporate the sample components from the tape, the speed of tape transport being matched to the scanning speed of the spectrometer.
