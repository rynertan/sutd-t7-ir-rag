# Colour display tube.

## Abstract
By providing a field correction element 30 in the peripheral field of a focusing lens of an electron gun system of a colour display tube, it is possible to reduce the potential differences between the electrodes of the focusing lens necessary for the horizontal and vertical focusing, respec tively, to acceptable values between minus 100 to plus 200 volts . The field correction element 30 consists of a plate 31 which extends substantially perpendicularly to the electron beams and has elongate or square apertures 32, 33, 34 through which the electron beams 6, 7, 8 pass. It is also possible to perform convergence corrections by means of such a field correction element.
