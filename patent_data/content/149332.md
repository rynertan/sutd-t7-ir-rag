# APPARATUS FOR MAKING FIBRE REINFORCED CEMENT SHEET MATERIAL

## Abstract
Apparatus for making fibre reinforced cement sheet material, particularly such material reinforced with glass fibres, comprises a vessel 10 for holding an aqueous fibre containing cement slurry and having an outlet defined between a water pervious belt 12 passing around a guide roller 13 and a superposed roller 17 , so that a layer of the cement slurry is deposited on the belt and subsequently de watered by drainage apparatus 24 , the de watered fibrous cement web being wound on to a roller from which sheets are cut when a sufficient thickness has been built up. An agitator in the vessel 10 comprises parallel strips 30 disposed in vertical planes at right angles to the roller axes and spaced across the width of the outlet immediately upstream thereof, the strips being mounted on a common horizontally reciprocable carriage 33,34 . The lower ends 47 of the strips 30 project right into the nip between the belt 12 and superposed roller 17 so as to produce turbulence immediately upstream of the outlet.
