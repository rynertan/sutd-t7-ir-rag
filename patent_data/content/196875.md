# Optical component mounting.

## Abstract
An improved technique for mounting optical compo nents on a substrate comprises providing each component with a dedicated heating element on the component itself to permit controlled and well localised heating of solder on the substrate during fixing. In the example illustrated the optical component is an optical fibre carrier comprising fibre 10 , carrier plate 12 and heating element 20 , which itself comprises an ink film resistor 22 deposited on a ceramic chip 21 having metallised electrical contacts 23 .
