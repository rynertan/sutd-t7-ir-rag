# Photosensitive relief image forming materials and method of forming relief images using same.

## Abstract
A relief image forming composition having an acidic pH comprises a photosensitive component and an indicator capable of existing in two states differing in actinic opacity dependent upon pH. A relief image is formed by 1 exposing to light selected areas of a layer of the composition, the indicator being in its state of lower actinic opacity, 2 removing layer material from the exposed areas or from the unexposed areas and 3 shifting the pH in the remaining layer material to a value at which the indicator exists in its state of higher actinic opacity. The resultant image can then be used as an intermediate original in diazotype copying processes.
