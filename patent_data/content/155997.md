# ACTUATING MECHANISM FOR PRINTING HEAD OF PRINTING MACHINE

## Abstract
An actuating mechanism for a printing head of a printing machine of the type in which a platen roller and a printing head is pressed against each other and an information record ing medium is passed between both of the devices and characterized in that the bumping of the printing head against the platen roller in the setting of them can be avoided to prevent the printing head from damaging. In the actuating mechanism for the printing head of the invention, either the platen roller or the printing head is swingably moved, and the mechanism is provided with a set spring which is interlocked with an actuating device and a suppressing member which suppresses the tension of the set spring, thereby avoiding the bumping that is caused in the setting of the platen roller and the printing head.
