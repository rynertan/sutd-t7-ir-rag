# A system for moulding soles onto shoe legs.

## Abstract
A system for moulding soles onto shoe legs comprises a rotatable moulding table 1 with locations 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d for a plurality of lasts 40 and an endless conveyor 6 situated next to the table and on which lasts 40 can be mounted and dismounted. A robot 70 is present between a second transfer station 10 on the moulding table 1 and a first transfer station 60 on the conveyor 6 . This robot transfers lasts 40 provided with shoe legs from the first transfer station 60 to the second transfer station 10 and later on from the latter back to the first transfer station 60 . Last holders 30 are mounted above the individual last locations 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d of the moulding table and as an integrating part of the moulding table 1 . These last holders are adapted opposite the second transfer station 10 to receive and retain the individual lasts 40 and later on when the last holder 30 has followed a 360 rotation of the moulding table 1 and returns to the second transfer station 10 to release the last 40 . The conveyor 6 is adapted to advance a plurality of conveyor plate members 80 carrying the individual lasts 40 , and these conveyor plate members are adapted oppo site the first transfer station 60 to release and receive, respectively, the lasts 40 transferred by the robot 70 . Each last 40 comprises at the top a gripping plate member 41 adapted to be gripped and retained by the robot 70 in an exact manner and to be fixed on the conveyor plate members 80 or on the last holders 30 . In this manner an essential reduction of the measure time of the moulding table is allowed, preferably by up to 33 , and the system is suited both for shoe lasts and boot lasts.
