# ULTRASONIC DIAGNOSTIC APPARATUS.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus is equipped with a matrix switch inspection means and is so constructed as to employ a mechanism which is provided on ordinary ultraso nic diagnostic apparatus. The apparatus incorporates a test sequencer. Taps on a delay line are changed by the test sequencer in order from one end of the line in one channel of a matrix switch. Every time the taps are changed from one to another, a testing signal is input to the channel from an ultrasonic probe driving means, and a signal obtained from the output end of the delay line is displayed as a false echo signal on the screen of a display. Thus, it is possible to detect a malfunction in the matrix switch on the basis of the pattern of the false echo image displayed on the screen.
