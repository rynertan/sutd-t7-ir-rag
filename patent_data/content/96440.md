# Intrinsic object sensing in a digital fan beam X ray inspection system.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a digital system includ ing circuitry for imaging items passing on a conveyor belt through an X ray fan beam. The circuitry of the present invention enables detection of the items as soon as the X ray beam is pierced and an image of the items is maintained on a monitor following removal of the items from the X ray beam. This enables detection of all items entering the X ray beam, and subsequent inspection of the items.
