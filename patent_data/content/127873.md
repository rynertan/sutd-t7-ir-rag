# Circuit arrangement comprising an isolator integral with an admittance element.

## Abstract
In a circuit arrangement comprising a three port isolator 21 which has input, output, and dummy ports 33, 22, and 23 , an admittance element 41 to 43 is connected at a posi tion or positions selected between the input and the output ports, between the output and the dummy ports, and between the dummy and the input ports. When the isolator comprises a strip line conductor having branches connected to the input, the output, and the dummy ports, the admittance element may be an extension or extensions of the branches. The out put port is connected to an amplifier 14 directly or through an inductance element 34 . The connection of the admittance element makes it unnecessary to connect a matching circuit which is otherwise essential between the isolator and the amplifier.
