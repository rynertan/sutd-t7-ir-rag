## Description
This invention relates to a multilayer analytical element for the measurement of the concentration of a substance which plays an important biochemical role or of various substances derived from the living body hereafter specific component using a protein capable of specifically binding the substance through a competitive reaction. The multilayer analytical element comprises a reaction layer where the aforesaid specific substance is reacted with a protein capable of specifically binding the same and a detection element comprising a detection layer which accepts or receives a signal formed in proportion to the concentration of a substance to be determined. The term signal is meant to refer to a detectable change that is directly or indirectly indicative of the presence and or concentration of the substance to be determined hereafter often referred to as analyte , or a reaction or decomposition product of the analyte. In clinical examination, various methods where several reagent solutions are added to a test liquid and the concentration of a specific component in the test liquid is measured are known. In these methods, reaction reagents must be accurately weighed and thoroughly mixed in order to improve the reproducibility of the measurement results and sometimes precipitates must be separated from supernatants by centrifugal techniques, which requires high skill. To replace such conventional methods, apparati which provide high reproducibility without requiring high skill by automating all such procedures have been developed. Such automated apparati are convenient for measuring large amounts of test liquids, but they have the serious disadvantage of being very expensive. In order to obviate the disadvantages of such automated apparati, multilayer analytical elements in which reaction reagents are incorporated have been proposed as a simple analytical means where the supply of reagent solutions is not substantially required so that high skill is not required. Such multilayer analytical elements are advantageous in that they are inexpensive as compared to the automated apparati described above. While various proposals have been made with respect to multilayer analysis elements utilizing chemical reactions or enzymatic reactions, it is still difficult to measure trace components or components having structural specificity to a high degree. In a method for the analysis of such components using reagent solutions, for example, it is known to utilize immunological reactions. However, only a few recent proposals have been made with respect to such multilayer analytical films in which reagents for immunological reaction are incorporated. When one attempts to apply immunological reaction techniques to conventional multilayer analytical films, it is difficult to obtain satisfactory analysis data due to problems involved in immunological analysis, such as insufficient immunological reaction, as will later be discussed. In Japanese Patent Publication 21677 78 the term publication means an examined patent application published for purpose of opposition, which is open to public inspection , a multilayer analytical element comprising a spreading layer of a non fibrous porous material and a reagent layer in which a medium such as gelatin or PVA is impregnated with a reagent is described. However, the volume of test liquid that can be absorbed in a short period of time is only several 2 or 3 µl to 20 µl per 1 cm² in the case of using isotropically porous materials such as blushed polymers cellulose acetate polymers, prepared in a manner as described in U.S. Patent 3,992,158 which are isotropically porous, i.e., possess porosity in all directions normally available or colloidal materials such as gelatin, and such materials absorb 25 µl of a test liquid necessary for immunological analysis in a short period of time only with difficulty. Accordingly, detection sensitivity is poor. In addition, a multilayer analytical element formed by laminating, in the following order, a spreading layer of a non fibrous porous material, a reagent layer containing a mutually reactive substance which gives diffusible chemical species which can be detected, a light shielding layer, a detection layer and a transparent support has also been suggested Japanese Patent Application OPI 40191 76 GB A 1519465 the term OPI indicates an unexamined published patent application open to public inspection . However, non fibrous porous materials employed for such an analytical element do not ensure sufficient water retainment in a short period of time thus, this analytical element also involves the disadvantage that only analytical data of poor sensitivity are obtained. Further, in Japanese Patent Application OPI 24576 81, a multilayer analytical element comprising a transparent support, a reagent layer obtained by incorporating reagents into colloidal substances and a fibrous porous carrier layer for eliminating interfering substances in a test sample is disclosed. However, incorporation of reagents proteins capable of effecting specific binding seriously inhibits the binding reaction with components effective for measurement so that poor detection sensitivity or a reduction in accuracy results. A multilayer analytical film for use in immunological reaction, considering the problems involved in immunological analytical is also known, as stated below. For example, the invention described in Japanese Patent Application OPI 90859 80 corresponding to EP A1 0013156 is characterized in that thermally stable organic polymer particles are bonded using an adhesive comprising an organic polymer different from the aforesaid polymer particles and that the adhesive is concentrated on the surfaces of adjoining particles in the areas of contact and the thus formed three dimensional particulate structure is used as the porous material layer described above. However, it is extremely difficult to prepare such a special material and it is also expensive. In addition, a disadvantage is that if the thickness of the particulate structure is increased to enable 25 µl or more of a test sample necessary for immunological analysis to be absorbed, the smoothness of the multilayer analytical element containing the particulate structure is seriously lowered so that upon spotting the measurement accuracy of optical density is decreased. In Japanese Patent Application OPI 131089 78 US A 4144306 and GB A 1599678 , a multilayer analytical element comprising a reagent layer having incorporated therein an immunologically bound pair antigen bound antibody and a layer for receiving diffused species provided thereunder is disclosed. In using this element, when a drop of test solution is spotted on the reagent layer, substitution release type immunologically competitive reaction occurs between a known amount of an immunologically bound pair labelled antigen bound antibody previously present in the reagent layer and a specific component in the test solution and a released species which acquires diffusibility as a result of immunological reaction diffuses into the layer for receiving the diffused species, where the released species is optically measured. However, in this method in which an unknown amount of antigen in a test solution is mutually reacted with the labelled antigen bound antibody to thereby release the labelled antigen, such release occurs very slowly and, as a result. the detectable diffusible species is released in an extremely small amount this results in markedly poor sensitivity and poor response. In particular, in the case of a component having molecular weight of several thousand e.g., insulin, molecular weight ca. 5,600 , only a calibration curve which is far from a standard calibration curve can be obtained even if incubation is conducted for 24 to 48 h. This technique is not suitable for rapid assay. In general, a method in which an antigen in a test solution and a labelled antigen are competitively reacted with an antibody simultaneously in immunological reaction using liquid reagents or a method comprising primarily reacting an antigen and an antibody in a test solution provide far higher sensitivity. For effecting such methods, it is necessary to provide two separate layers, i.e., a reaction layer having incorporated therein either a labelled antigen or an antibody and a reagent layer having incorporated therein an antibody or a labelled antigen. In this case. reagents in the reagent layer are dissolved out with the test solution and substantially freely diffuse into the reaction layer, where the reagents cause a competitive antigen antibody reaction with an unknown amount of an antibody or antigen or antibody contained in the test solution. The multilayer analytical element in accordance with this invention is a dry type analytical material suitable for quantitative analysis of a specific component utilizing the above described competitive antigen antibody reaction. As a result of extensive studies on analytical elements that maintain high sensitivity and reproducibility comparable to the prior art immunological assay methods which comprise weighing a test solution and mixing the same with reagents to cause reaction and which enable simple operation without requiring high skill characteristic of dry type analysis the present inventors noted that in order to ensure high sensitivity and high reproducibility, it is necessary for at least 25 µl, desirably 50 to 200 µl, of a test solution to participate in a competitive immunological reaction, as in the prior art method of wet type in which a test solution is weighed and mixed with reagents to cause an immunological reaction. The amount at least 25 µl is a considerably larger amount when compared to the amount of analyte used in conventional dry type multilayer analysis films which are mostly intended to utilize chemical reactions other than immune response and accordingly, these conventional analytical films cannot be employed directly for purpose of immunological examination. Based upon the foregoing, it has been found that a fibrous porous medium without a continuous coating is appropriate as an immunologically reactive medium which possesses a volume capable of absorbing at least 25 µl of sample solution per square cm reagent layer. Further, it has been found that this fibrous porous medium undergoes a change in shape, such as curling, due to absorption of a sample solution only with difficulty and therefore is extremely advantageous from the viewpoint of optical measurement. An object of this invention is to provide a dry type multilayer analytical element of high detection sensitivity and high accuracy. The multilayer analytical element of this invention for assaying the concentration of a specific component in an aqueous medium utilizing a competitive reaction in the presence of a predetermined amount of a protein to be specifically bound to a specific component and a labelled specific component which is capable of reacting with said protein, comprises is characterized in that the reaction layer comprises a fibrous porous medium swellable to increase its thickness when the aqueous sample solution is spotted thereon so as to absorb at least 25 µl of the aqueous sample solution per square cm reagent layer therein, The specific component and the protein to be specifically bound thereto, preferably form a pair causing immunological interaction. Fig. 1 is a cross sectional view representing a basic structure of the multilayer analytical element of this invention. Figs. 2 to 4 are cross sectional views representing various preferred embodiments of the multilayer analytical element of this invention. In the drawings, numerals indicate The optically detectable signal is generally a labelled complex label substances directly or indirectly detectable with optical means as later described formed as a result of a competitive immunological reaction in the presence of 1 a predetermined amount of a protein which specifically recognizes and binds to a specific component analyte in a sample solution and 2 a predetermined amount of a complex of the specific component and a label which is also capable of reacting with the aforesaid specifically binding protein alternatively, the optically detectable signal is a substance or species which is formed depending upon the amount of the labelled complex as a result of a competitive immune reaction using as a label an optically detectable substance including indirect optical detection as is well known in the art. The reaction layer functions, when contacting the element of this invention with a liquid containing an analyte, to cause the analyte or a reaction product of the analyte to interact with a protein contained in the reaction layer which specifically recognizes and binds to the analyte to produce a detectable change within the element. Thus, the reaction layer should not contain substantial amounts of a specific component analyte , its analogue or a complex with the label, if this is the case, quantitative determination of the analyte would be impossible because undesired interaction would occur between the analyte to be determined and the specific component, if they are contained in the reaction layer and interfere quantitative response. The term not substantially is meant to refer to a negligible amount or an amount of a specific component that do not impede competitive immunological reaction contemplated in the reaction layer. The multilayer analytical element of this invention absorbs a sufficient amount at least 25 µl, desirably 53 to 200 µl of sample solution necessary for immunologically competitive reaction per square cm reagent layer so that it provides high sensitivity and high reproducibility. Further, the multilayer analytical element enables analysis without any particular skill in a simple manner in an extremely short period of time. The multilayer analytical element of this invention can be of any shape insofar as it is suitable for analysis, but a sheet like or film like shape is generally preferred. In this case, it is preferred that the detection element be closely contacted with the reaction layer so that the contact portion is in a uniformly wet state at the interface when a sample solution is spotted onto the reaction layer. The multilayer analytical element of this invention can be employed. for example, as described below. Given a known amount of antibody or antigen , the level of its corresponding antigen or antibody can be determined. It is preferred that an analyte antigen or antibody to be analyzed or quantitatively measured which is contained in a sample solution be labelled with a labelling substance and a given amount of the labelled substance be incorporated into a reagent layer provided separately from the reaction layer a sample solution is then dropped thereon. Alternatively, a mixture obtained by previously mixing the labelled substance with a sample solution can also be dropped onto the multilayer analysis element. Such a reagent layer can generally be provided between the reaction layer and the detection layer, but it is preferred that the reagent layer be located on the reaction layer opposite from the detection layer. The analyte antigen or antibody in a sample solution and the labelled antigen or antibody competitively react with a protein corresponding antibody or antigen which specifically recognizes and binds to the antigen or antibody in the reaction layer to form an immunological complex usually at 0 to 65 C., preferably 10 to 45 C for 1 min to 24 h under normal pressure while conditions vary depending upon kind of analyte, mode of reaction and layer structure . Excess or unreacted analyte including an excess or unreacted labelled antigen diffuses into the detection layer. The unreacted analyte specific component or the unreacted labelled antigen or antibody is directly optically measured or, an optically detectable signal is formed by reacting a reagent such as a dye, a dye precursor, which enables optical measurement in proportion to the labelling substance and then optically measured. On the other hand, based upon the amount of labelled antigen or antibody obtained corresponding to a known amount of specific component or signal substance produced therefrom, a calibration curve can be previously prepared. By comparison to this calibration curve, the analyte specific component is measured or quantitatively determined. In this invention, a specific component is primarily detected by optical means. Therefore. it is desired that a light shielding layer be provided to eliminate the possibility that interfering substances other than a specific component is measured e.g., erythrocytes or hemoglobin in the case of using whole blood as a sample solution, or a fluorescence labelled or dye labelled antigen or antibody , participate in the optical measurement. The light shielding layer may be a light reflecting layer or a light absorbing layer. In general, the light shielding layer is inserted between the reaction layer and the detection layer however, in the case where a light shielding function is imparted to the reaction layer, the light shielding layer can be omitted. The reaction layer is composed of a fibrous porous medium having voids of 20 to 90 , preferably 50 to 90 . Typical examples of fibrous porous media which can be employed in the reaction layer include natural fibers such as pulp, cotton, silk, wool semisynthetic fibers such as cellulose esters, viscose rayon synthetic fibers such as polyamides, polyesters, polyolefins further, fibrous inorganic materials, e.g., glass fibers, colored glass fibers, asbestos in the form of a textile fabric that is woven or knitted , felt fabric of Filz matted, compressed animal fibers by applying heat, moisture or pressure , non woven fabric fibers more closely joined to each other by chemical treatment or heating of fiber per se or fibers adhered to each other using an adhesive or water permeable paper, can be used. In more detail, there can be used a wide variety of fabrics such as natural fibers derived from plants, animals and minerals and artificial fibers such as inorganic, regenerated, semi synthetic and synthetic fibers. Of various useful fabric forms, a plain weave which is formed by weaving warp and weft yarns alternately is preferably used. As for the warp and weft which compose such a plain weave, a desirable count ranges from 20 to 120. Of plain woven fabrics, cotton fabrics of the type termed sheeting, shirting broadcloth and poplin are preferably employed. In addition to other natural fibers woven in the same manners as the above described cotton fabrics e.g., kapok, flax, hemp, ramie and silk , fabrics obtained by weaving mixed yarns of chemical fibers as described above and fabrics obtained by weaving chemical fiber yarns in the same manner as in the above described cotton fabrics can also be employed. The fibers described above can be used in the reaction layer in the form of non woven fabrics formed into a sheet, not in the textile form. Paper which can be used in the reaction layer can be freely chosen so long as it is water permeable. More specifically, a filter paper giving voids of 20 to 90 can be used particularly preferred is thin, fine filter paper. Indian paper or Japanese paper such as paper made of paper mulberry or Mitsumata, can also be employed. Not only natural cellulose paper but also synthetic paper made of, e.g., polystyrene, polyester, polyethylene, polypropylene obtained by paper making fibers of synthetic high molecular weight substances which possesses water permeability , asbestos, glass fiber filter paper, can also be employed as the reaction layer. Further, the incorporation of fine particles having a particle size of 1 µm to 1 mm, preferably 10 to 300 µm of dextran, agarose, acrylamides, cellulose, into these fibrous porous materials by mixing the particles with these materials increases water retention capability of the reaction layer which is advantageous. While in the case where fine particles are incorporated into the fibrous material, the water retention capability of the reaction layer can be further improved as a whole due to the water retention capability of the fine particles while maintaining the fibrous nature of the porous medium, the fibrous porous nature should be maintained in the reaction layer as a whole and, accordingly, the amount of fine particles which can be incorporated preferably thoroughly mixed can be automatically determined. In general, the amount of fine particles is in the range of up to 90 wt based on the total weight of the reaction layer. To incorporate a protein capable of specifically binding a specific component into fibrous porous media or materials containing fine particles, one can incorporate fine particles into fibrous materials wherein the protein described above has previously been bound to the fine particles, either chemically in a manner as described in, e.g., P. Cuatrecasas, Because of its excellent water retention property, the fibrous porous material described above retains the required amount at least 25 µl per square cm reagent layer of spotted sample solution for a time period sufficient for the immune reaction to proceed. To exhibit this water retention or absorbing capability of the porous medium more effectively, it is preferred that the reaction layer comprising the porous medium have a volume smaller than that of the detection element c.f. Figs. 2 to 4 . The detection element used herein is meant to refer to essentially the detection layer for receiving an optically detectable signal released or formed in the element and in addition thereto, can include various optional functional layers as will be later described. It is preferred that the reaction layer be superimposed on the detection layer so as not to extend to or project over from the detection element, as shown in Figs. 2 to 4, but is large enough to retain therein a volume of a sample solution effective for the optical measurement. In such a multilayer analytical element, when a sample solution is spotted thereon, undesired swelling of the reaction layer in the horizontal direction is only slightly observed rather the reaction layer can swell only so as to increase its thickness. Accordingly the multilayer analytical element can retain a sample solution in the reaction layer for a time period sufficient for the immunologically competitive reaction to proceed, which results in a greater change in the signal. In addition, curling which is observed with conventional known multilayer analysis films does not occur such is particularly advantageous in optical measurement. The reaction layer can contain various reagents necessary for the immunological reaction and reactions which enable detection, except for labelled antigen which is incorporated into the detection layer. Addition of the labelled antigen should be avoided since the measurement sensitivity of an analyte is seriously decreased. Further, the reaction layer can be composed of two or more layers for example, a sample solution can be sequentially exposed to two separate antigen antibody reactions by incorporating different compositions into each of the two layers so that a detectable change, if it is weak, can be intensified. In this case, an antibody to an interfering component in a sample solution is incorporated after the interfering component is thereby eliminated, an antigen antibody reaction in which the analyte is used as a second antigen or antibody can be effected in the lower immunological reaction layer. The reaction layer is provided on the detection layer, directly or indirectly via various functional layers such as a timing layer for controlling the rate at which a liquid is transported from the reaction layer, a light reflection layer or light absorption layer. The reaction layer, which is designed to have an area smaller than that of the detection layer in one embodiment of this invention, is of significance in that the reaction layer is physically restricted from expanding in the horizontal direction. Accordingly, it is difficult to specify the area thereof with a specific numerical value rather, the area is determined depending upon or taking into account the necessary amount of a sample solution to be spotted. The kind and concentration of specific component also called an analyte , and production cost. It is necessary that the detection element has or exhibits planarity upon measurement in order to maintain sufficient accuracy of measurement accordingly, it is generally necessary for the detection element to comprise supporting means such as a frame, for mechanically compressing the element at the edge portions. On the other hand, it is sufficient that the reaction layer has a surface. On the other hand, the size of the reaction layer can be smaller than that of the detection element in other words, it is sufficient that the reaction layer has an area large enough to provide around the center thereof openings for spotting liquids therethrough. If the size of the reaction layer is the same as that of the detection layer, such would result in waste of expensive reagents. A protein which specifically recognizes and binds to an analyte is incorporated into the reaction layer. Representative examples of the anylate include Complexes are bacilla, viruses, cell membranes, genes, nuclei. The molecular weight of these complexes is at least 5,000, ordinarily 10,000 or more. Polypeptides and proteins generally have a molecular weight of from 5,000 to 5,000,000, usually 20,000 to 1,000,000. In the case of peptide hormones, the molecular weight thereof generally ranges from 5,000 to 60,000. protamine, albumin, globulins α β particularly immunoglobulin, IgG, IgA, IgE, IgM, IgD , scleroproteins structural proteins such as collagen, elastin, actin mucoprotein chromoprotein, lipoprotein, nucleoprotein, glycoprotein, phosphoprotein insulin, glucagon, somatotropin, corticotropin, gonadotripin, gastrin, secretin, pituitary hormone, precursors thereof and metabolites thereof coccus Streptococcus, Staphylococcus , bacillus bacillus anthracis, bacillus subtilis, clostridium tetani actinomyces Actinomyces , eumycetes nocardia, aspergillus, candida , rickettsia typhus, tutugamushi disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Q fever , viruses herpes, adenoid vegitation, albo, hepatitis spirochaeta syphilis, leptospira, treponema and other pathogenic bacteria Antigenic low molecular weight substances have a molecular weight of generally from 100 to 2,000, usually 125 to 1,000, e.g., drugs, agricultural chemicals, small peptides, amino acids, low molecular weight hormones and metabolites thereof. alkaloids morphine, codeine, kinine, digoxine , etc. , 5 or 6 membered lactams barbiturate , amino alkyl benzenes amphetamine, epinephrine, catecholamine , benzo heterocyclic compounds oxazepam, chlorpromazine , purines theophylline, caffeine , vitamins A, B complex, C, D, E , prostaglandins, antibiotics penicillin, tetracycline, cephalosporin , aminoglycosides gentamycine, kanamycine , other drugs methadone, meprobamate, lidocaine, griseoflavin , and metabolites of these drugs. halogenated biphenyls, phosphoric acid esters, thiophosphate and metabolites thereof. c small peptides, amino acids, low molecular weight hormones, triiodothyronine, thyroxine, encephaline, bradykinine, angiotensine I and II, and metabolites thereof. Analysis of a component causing an immunological reaction using the multilayer analysis element of this invention is based upon the principle that a labelled specific component and an unlabelled specific componet competitively react with a protein which specifically binds these specific components to thereby cause a change in signal and the amount of change of the thus changed signal is measured As a method for labelling enabling one to measure a specific component based upon this principle, a method using a dye, which makes optical measurement possible is excellent in simplicity and safety. In the present invention, spectrophotometry or fluorophotometry can be utilized as the optical measurement system. In any case, optical measurement can be practiced by a reflection or transmission system, but a reflection system is preferred in that interfering substances can be eliminated thereby. In spectrophotometry, ultraviolet rays, infrared rays can be utilized in addition to visible rays. Fluorophotometry is effected with a fluorescent substance diffused into the detection layer, and the excitation light and fluorescence wavelength can be optionally chosen depending upon the purpose and utility desired. Labelling of a specific component is carried out in a conventional manner as described in, e.g., Avrameas et al., As enzymes for labelling, peroxidase, β D galactosidase or glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase can be used. Fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC , tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate TMRIT can be employed for fluorescence labelling. Dyes for labelling are not overly limited, and any dyes can be employed so Iong as they are water soluble and have relatively small molecular weight useful dyes are described in Dye precursors can be used and are also not particularly limited, e.g., leuco dyes used in pressure sensitive recording materials, heat sensitive recording materials can be employed. The detection layer receives a signal changed through competitive reaction i.e., reaction products or detectable species released or formed in the element as a result of competitive reaction . The detection layer is basically located below the reaction layer since it receives the detectable change that is produced in or released from the reaction layer. When an element includes a support, various functional layers such as a water absorbing layer, will usually, but not necessarily, be interposed in the element between the support and the detection layer. Further, functional layers such as a light reflection layer, a light absorption layer, can be located over the detection layer. In the specification, the detection layer is an essential zone in the element and these functional layers are collectively termed the detection element. The detection layer can be composed of the same fibrous porous media as is used for the reaction layer, e.g., textiles, non woven fabrics paper. Hydrophilic high molecular weight substances can be employed as binders for the detection layer. Examples of binders which can be employed in this invention include natural hydrophilic high molecular weight substances such as gelatin, agarose, sodium alginate, carboxymethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, etc. hydrophilic synthetic high molecular weight substances such as polyacrylamide, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium polyacrylate, polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate, copolymers containing acrylic acid e.g., styrene acrylic acid copolymer , copolymers containing maleic acid e.g., a maleic anhydride methyl vinyl ether copolymer . When a labelled specific component has a molecular weight of several hundred thousands as does IgG, agarose, polyacrylamide, sodium polyacrylate and copolymers containing acrylic acid are particularly preferred since macromolecular substances such as IgG can be appropriately retained in the network formed by these binder materials. Incorporation of water absorbing polymers into materials constructing the detection layer is preferred since a signal can more effectively be collected for the detection whereby sensitivity as well as metering capability are improved. Further, when a water absorbing polymer is incorporated is provided above, below or adjacent to the detection layer, a signal is more effectively collected and such is advantageous. As such water absorbing polymers, hydrophilic synthetic or natural high molecular weight substances as described above can be employed singly or as a combination of two or more thereof. The use of gelatin in combination with polymers having a carboxy group, e.g., vinylpyrrolidone acrylic acid copolymers makes swelling extremely easy and gives particularly preferred results. In general, materials which provide capability of absorbing water of at least 5 times its dead weight, preferably at least 10 times, in 5 mins, are chosen for the water absorbing detection layer. Plural layers can be present between a support and a light shielding layer and these layers all function as the detection element as described above. The reagent layer is located usually over the reaction layer. The reagent layer may contain a variety of substances essential or desirable to effect immunological reaction and other reactions which render optical detection directly or indirectly possible and render optical measurement of the formed signal possible, except for an antibody. For example, enzyme or fluorescence labelled antigens enzyme substrates co enzymes such as NAD, NADH NADP, NADPH buffers for rendering pH constant surface active agents, gelatin stabilizers for bovine serum albumin coloring agents, can be present. In addition, blocker or pretreatment reagents e.g., salicylic acid, 8 anilino 1 naphthalenesulfonic acid ANS , for measurement of T₄ can also be present to render a testing component which is conjugated with a body component such as a protein or the like free. A part of these reagents can also be incorporated into a spreading layer and or a spreading assisting layer, if desired or necessary, which can be provided above the reagent layer. Further, a part of these reagents e.g., blocker reagents can previously be mixed with a sample solution without incorporating the same into a multilayer analytical element, e.g., the reagent layer, and the resulting mixture can then spotted onto the spreading layer or reagent layer. It is often preferred that a timing layer be provided between the reaction layer and the detection element. The timing layer ensures that a sample solution can be retained in the reaction layer for a certain period of time to thereby complete reaction and then makes the resulting reaction product diffuse into the detection layer after a certain period of time. When this layer is provided, detection sensitivity and quantitative nature are further markedly improved. As materials for the timing layer the aforesaid hydrophilic synthetic or natural polymers can be employed singly or in combination of two or more. Gelatin having various degrees of hardness is preferably used in the timing layer depending upon the purpose in this case, strongly hardened gelatin can delay the transport of a liquid and relatively mildly hardened gelatin can provide a mild delay of the transport of a liquid. In addition to the above, various functional supporting layers or structural auxiliary layers some of which have already mentioned hereinbefore conventional in the art can be provided in the multilayer analytical element of this invention for purposes of supporting basic functions of the reaction layer and the detection layers or maintaining the structure thereof. These supporting or auxiliary layers include, e.g., a spreading or diffusing layer to assist metering and spreading of a sample solution and a hematocyte separating layer hematocyte interferes with optical measurement of a detectable change in a certain analysis and is separated using a material which retains macromolecular hematocyte therein or an adhesive layer, all of which are optional. Details of these supporting or auxiliary layers are described in, e.g., U.S. Patent 4,292,272. The location of these auxiliary layers can easily be determined by one skilled in the art depending upon the functions thereof and it is believed to be unnecessary to provide detailed descriptions herein. Layer thickness of essential and various optional functional layers included in the multilayer analytical element of this invention can vary depending upon kind of layer structure, functions required, but the following layer thickness is generally desired When a fluorescent substance or a dye is employed as a label, it is directly optically detectable in the detection layer and no particular reagents are required in the detection layer. When a leuco dye. e.g., a leuco dye used for pressure sensitive recording paper or heat sensitive recording paper, is employed as a labelling substance, acidic substances such as acid clay are dispersed in a binder and the dispersion is coated on a support to yield the detection layer a leuco dye labelled specific component which is diffused or transported into the detection layer forms a color therein and optical measurement is possible. When an enzyme is employed as a labelling substance, the detection layer is formed by dispersing an enzyme substrate and a reducible dye precursor or a fluorescent precursor in a hydrophilic polymer and then coating the dispersion on a support. When labelling enzyme is, e.g., peroxidase, the detection layer can be formed if undesired or necessary in double layer form by dispersing glucose, glucose oxidase to generate hydrogen peroxide from glucose , 4 aminoantipyrine and 1,7 dihydroxynaphthalene reduced dye precursor which is oxidized in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and peroxidase in gelatin, agarose or polyacrylamide and coating the dispersion on a support. Further, when the labelling enzyme is β D galactosidase, 4 methylumbelliferyl β D galactopyranoside is dispersed in a hydrophilic polymer and a layer is formed on a support from the dispersion. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, a light shielding layer that permits effective passage of radiation used to detect a detectable change produced in the analytical element, is provided between the reaction layer and the detection layer, and it is preferred that the light shielding layer be a radiation absorbing layer or reflecting layer. The radiation absorbing layer is effective to absorb excitation wavelength to minimize a blank value due to reflection of the excitation wavelength for example, when measurement of reflecting fluorescence is performed from the support side. It is possible to design a suitable system dependent on excitation wavelength and the emission wavelength. Various dyes, coloring agents or pigments can be employed in addition to yellow colloidal silver. On the other hand, a radiation reflecting layer is used in the case of measuring reflected spectral absorption from the support side and is obtained by dispersing a white powder, such as finely divided TiO₂ or BaSO₄ in a hydrophilic high molecular weight binder in an amount of 1 to 25 wt and forming a layer from the dispersion in a thickness as described above. It is necessary that a labelled compound or a detectable reaction procuct which makes detection of a specific component possible be effectively collected in the detection layer For this reason, materials having particularly excellent water absorbing capability among the above described materials. e.g., hydrophilic natural or synthetic high molecular weight substances such as gelatin, polyvinyl alcohol, are preferably employed for the detection layer. In addition, a filter paper, a glass fiber filter paper, a micro filter can also be employed. Further, in another preferred embodiment of this invention, substances having a strong interaction with a labelled compound or reaction product which makes detection possible, e.g.. mordanting agents, are preferably incorporated in the detection layer in order to collect the compound or reaction product therein. As such mordanting agents, cationic polymers as described in Japanese Patent Applicatinn OPI 24694 80, e.g., a polymer of quaternary salts of 4 vinylpyridine and 2 methyl 1 vinylimidazole, poly N,N,N trimethyl N vinylbenzyl ammonium chloride other cationic polymers well known in the photographic art and anionic polymers as described in Japanese Patent Application 28158 81 can be used. Latexes of these polymers are preferred in view of improved diffusion resistance, ease in handling. To improve various efficiencies such as coating efficiency, diffusibility of diffusible compounds, reactivity, preservability, various additives such as surface active agents, pH controlling agents, finely divided powders, antioxidants, other organic or inorganic additives can also be incorporated in the detection layer. Supports used for the multilayer analytical element of this invention are transparent to optical measurement and it is preferred that the supports be water impermeable depending upon necessity. Specific examples of light transmissible water impermeable supports include plastic films such as polyethylene terephthalate, cellulose esters cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, cellulose acetate propionate , polycarbonate polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate and a glass plate. Known transparent supports having a thickness as described above can be used. As supports for a multilayer analytical element in which a specific component is labelled with a fluorescent substance is employed, low fluorescence radiation transmitting supports such as polycarbonate cellulose esters, polystyrene are particularly preferably employed. In the case that a support is hydrophobic and provides poor adhesion to the hydrophilic binder in the detection layer, known auxiliary treatments such as treatment for rendering the surface of the support hydrophilic e.g., ultraviolet irradiation, electron irradiation, flame treatment, hydrolysis with an alkali, a plasma treatment, a glow discharge treatment , provision of a subbing layer comprising an appropriate adhesive for the hydrophilic binders in both the support and the detection layer on the surface of the support, formation of minute uneven portions brushing, electrolytic etching at the surface of the support to a degree that light transmittance is not significantly decreased can be performed. An aqueous sample solution spreading layer often simply referred to as spreading layer can be provided as the uppermost layer of the multilayer analytical element of this invention. The spreading layer has the effect of uniformly spreading a sample solution dropped onto the multilayer analytical element. When the reaction layer is composed of a woven fabric, non woven fabric or paper, the spreading layer can be omitted, of course. For the spreading layer, fabrics which have been rendered hydrophilic are employed. As such fabrics rendered hydrophilic, there are fabrics that are cleaned and rinsed with water to defat the same followed by drying and fabrics that are, after cleaning and rinsing with water to defat the same, impregnated with a small amount of a surface active agent, a wetting agent, a hydrophilic polymer or a dispersion of finely divided powders of TiO₂ or BaSO₄ in a hydrophilic polymer. Techniques using fabrics which have been subjected to hydrophilic treatment as the spreading layer, kind of fabrics, layer thickness are described in detail in Japanese Patent Application OPI 164356 80, U.S. Patent 4,292,272, and can be applied to this invention in accordance with the description therein. Hereafter this invention will be described in more detail with reference to the Examples below. In 150 ml of dried tetrahydrofuran 1.65 g 0.002 mol of thyroxine methyl ester hydrochloride was dissolved. To the resulting solution 300 µl 0.0021 mol of triethylamine and 200 mg 0.0022 mol of succinic anhydride were added. The mixture was stirred at 4 C overnight to effect reaction. After the reaction mixture had been washed three times with a 10 saline solution, it was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate followed by concentration under reduced pressure. The concentrate was subjected to column chromatography with a mixture of methanol acetone 2 8 using 30 g of Sephadex LH 20 . By checking the effluent by TLC, fractions of the product was obtained. The solvent was removed by distillation under reduced pressure and the residue was dissolved in methanol. To the resulting solution, water was added to crystallize. 1.48 g of crystals were obtained yield was 82.5 . In 1 ml of dioxane, 100 mg 0.11 mmol of thyroxine hemisuccinamide was dissolved. After cooling the resulting solution to 15 C, 14 µl 0.11 mmol of isobutyl chloroformate and 15 µl 0.11 mmol of triethylamine were added thereto and the mixture vigorously shaken. A solution of 1.0 g of peroxidase POD in 3 ml of dioxane water 1 1 cooled to 0 C was added to the mixture. A 1N sodium hydroxide solution was added to the mixture. While maintaining pH of the mixture at 8.0 to 8.5, the mixture was stirred for 5 h. The reaction liquid was dialyzed overnight at 4 C using a 0.02M sodium carbonate buffer pH 8.5 . Fractionation was performed using a Sephadex G 10 column 2x50 cm . For elution, a 0.05M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 was used. After the effluent was divided into approximately 1.0 ml fraction, absorption at 280 nm and enzyme activity were measured and the fraction showing the maximum activity was chosen. Detection element By laminating or coating i to iii below in the order recited, a detection element was obtained and cut into 2 cm squares. a colorless transparent cellulose triacetate film thickness 130 µm 3.02 g of gelatin, 18.0 g of o phenyleriediamine and 20,000 U of glucose oxidase were coated per 1 m². Further, citrate NaH₂PO₄ buffer pH 4.8 was added to insure a buffering function. Layer thickness was 15 µm. 4.6 g of gelatin and 36.2 g of barium sulfate were coated per 1 m² onto the detection layer described above. Layer thickness was 12.6 µm. 0.9 g of a cellulose filter paper e.g., Toyo Filter Paper No. 5A made by Toyo Filter Paper Co. Ltd. was well washed with purified water and dispersed in 20 ml. of purified water. To the dispersion 10N NaOH was added and the pH of the mixture adjusted to 12. While maintaining the pH at 11 to 12 with 10N NaOH, 40 ml of a 5.0 wt BrCN aqueous solution was added dropwise to obtain activated cellulose, during which the system was ice cooled below 20 C. After completing the reaction, the reaction mixture was filtered through a glass filter. After washing the residue with 1 liter of cold water, it was dispersed in 100 ml. of 0.1M NaHCO₃. To a 10 fold dilution of 1 ml of antithyroxine rabbit sera manufactured by Cappel Research Laboratories with a 0.05M phosphate buffer saline PBS pH 7.3 , the aforesaid activated cellulose was added. After shaking overnight at 4 C, the mixture was filtered and the residue was dispersed in 0.15M NaCl. The dispersion was then filtered using a glass filter. To the residue, 100 ml of 0.02M ethanolamine the pH of which was adjusted at 8.0 using HCl was added and the mixture was reacted at room temperature for 1 h. Thereafter, the reaction product was washed with 1 liter of a 0.15M saline solution and then with 1 liter of a 0.05M phosphate buffer pH 7.3 and dispersed again in 20 ml of a 1 glucose solution. The dispersion was spreaded over and in fine nylon mesh, which was directly freeze dried. The dry thickness after stripping of the nylon mesh was 0.9 mm.

The reaction layer thus obtained had voids of 80 . The POD labelled thyroxine in an amount of 1 U calculated as POD activity prepared in Example 1 2 was mixed with 100 µl of a standard thyroxine solution 1 to 16 µg dl . 100 µl of the mixture was dropped onto the multilayer analytical element prepared as described above, respectively, which was maintained at 37 C. Thirty mins. after dropping, reflection optical density was measured at 437 nm from the support side. Results are shown in the table below were obtained. When the results were plotted on a graph, a linear relationship was seen between thyroxine concentration and reflection density. Accordingly, it is possible to quantitatively determine an unknown amount of thyroxine contained in a liquid sample by measuring reflection density. A reagent layer as shown below was further provided on the immunological reaction layer of a multilayer analytical element having the same structure as in Example 1 3 . The same filter paper as was used in the reaction layer of Example 1 iv was cut into 1 cm. squares and impregnated with the POD labelled thyroxine prepared in Example 1 2 in an amount of 1 U cm² calculated as POD activity followed by freeze drying 1.33x10 ³ mbar 10 ³ mmHg in a freezer at 20 C . The thus obtained reagent layer was laminated onto the aforesaid immunological reaction layer. Onto the thus prepared multilayer analytical element, 100 µl of a standard thyroxine solution 1 to 16 µg dl was dropped. The element was maintained at 37 C. Thirty mins after dropping, reflection density was measured at 437 nm from the support side. The following results were obtained. When the results were plotted, a linear relationship was seen between thyroxine concentration and reflection density. Accordingly, it is possible to quantitatively determine an unknown amount of thyroxine contained in a liquid sample by measuring reflection density.

To the aforesaid Boc Gly OSu solution the thyroxine methyl ester solution was added while cooling with ice. After permitting the same to warm to room temperature, the mixture was stirred for 1.5 h. After letting the reaction mixture stand overnight, 25 ml of distilled water and 50 ml of ethyl acetate were added thereto and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The extraction was repeated three times using 25 ml of ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layers were combined and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The liquid was concentrated using a rotary evaporator and subjected to gel chromatography using a column filled with Sephadex LH 20 made by Pharmacia Co., Ltd. .

By confirming by TLC, the desired fraction was taken and concentrated under reduced pressure followed by crystallization. The product was obtained in an amount of 950 mg. yield 82.5 . 950 mg 1 mmol of Boc Gly T₄ OCH₃ synthesized in i above was dissolved in 10 ml of trifluoroacetic acid and the solution was stirred for 10 mins under ice cooling. The solvent was then removed by distillation at a temperature below 40 C under reduced pressure. The residue was subjected to gel chromatography under the same conditions as in i to remove a fraction of the product. Crystallization of the fraction gave 700 mg, of the product yield 82.5 . 320 mg 0.33 mmol of Gly T₄ OCH₃ trifluoroacetic acid salt obtained in ii and 47 µl 0.33 mmol of Et₃N were dissolved in 5 ml of methanol.

A glass fiber filter paper Toyo Filter Paper GA 100, made by Toyo Filter Paper Co., Ltd. having a thickness of 0.3 mm was cut into 1 cm squares and impregnated with anti T₄ serum made by Cappel Research Laboratories diluted with a 0.02M sodium phosphate buffer pH 5.5 containing 0.5 bovine serum albumin followed by freeze drying 1.33x10 ³ mbar 10 ³ mmHg in a freezer at 20 C . The freeze dried material was cut into 2 cm. squares and laminated on to the centre of the detection element described above, the surface of which had been wetted with water. The thus obtained reaction layer had voids of 70 . The same glass fiber filter paper as used in the immune reaction layer was cut into 1 cm. squares and impregnated with an FITC T₄ aqueous solution in an amount of 25 ng cm² calculated as FITC T₄ followed by drying. The thus dried material was laminated onto the immunological reaction layer described above. The thus prepared multilayer analytical element was treated as in Example 1 3 and then fluorescence was measured excitation wavelength 490 nm emission wavelength 520 nm . Quantitative results as shown below were obtained. When these results were plotted on a graph, good correspondence was noted between thyroxine concentration and relative intensity of fluorescence. Accordingly, it is possible to quantitatively determine an unknown amount of thyroxine by measuring fluorescence intensity. A multilayer analytical element was prepared as in Example 1 except that the immunological reaction layer was prepared by further incorporating antibody immobilized particles therein as described below. Immobilization of the antibody was performed as in Example 1 except that 1 g of CN Sepharose 4B made by Pharmacia Co., Ltd. was employed instead of cellulose filter paper acitvated with BrCN. Thus, anti thyroxine antibody immobilized Sepharose 4B was obtained. 1.0 g of a filter paper Toyo Filter Paper No. 5A made by Toyo Filter Paper Co., Ltd. was wetted with water to loosen its tissue and dispersed in water. The dispersion was well mixed with 1.0 g of the antibody immobilized Sepharose described above and the mixture was spread over and into a nylon mesh followed by freeze drying 1.33x10 ³ mbar 10 ³ mmHg in a freezer at 20 C .
