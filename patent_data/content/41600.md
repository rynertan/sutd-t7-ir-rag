# Method for passivating a semiconductor device.

## Abstract
A group II VI compound semiconductor 16 is used as a surface passivator to control recombination of charge carriers at the surface of a group III V compound semiconductor 12, 14 by a localized heating step. Control of the recombination of the charge carriers is achieved by chemical reaction of the II VI compound with excess group V element. In particular, a capping layer 16 of laser annealed ZnS is used for passivat ing a GaAs device 12, 14 .
