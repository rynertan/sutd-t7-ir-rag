# 4 Vinyl 2 methylene butanedioic acid compounds.

## Abstract
4 Vinyl 2 methylenebutanedioic acid and its esters, as well as amide and nitrile analogs of these compounds, are disclosed. These compounds are capable of under going a rapid free radical cyclopolymerization reaction. The compounds, themselves, may be used as film for mers for example, in paints or plastics or may be used as groups pendant from a backbone, especially a low molecular weight backbone, to form other, more complex film forming polymer precursor materials.
