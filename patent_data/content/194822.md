# METHODS OF AND APPARATUS FOR COMPILING HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE STATEMENTS INTO LOW LEVEL LANGUAGE INSTRUCTION SETS

## Abstract
Apparatus for compiling high level computer language statements into a low level computer language instruction sets, comprises means for detecting completion of the inputting by a keyboard 2 of each line of a high level language source program, and for storing the line in a predetermined memory area 4f , means 4a for compiling each of the input lines of source program upon completion of the inputting of the line to generate low level language instructions, and means for storing the compiled low level language instructions in another predetermined memory area 4d . The machine language object program may be linked with a runtime routine library so as to enable execution of the object program when the object program is outputted in response to a command input through the keyboard 2 .
