# Straight knife machine with safety features.

## Abstract
A cutting machine 10 comprising a housing 20 having a base 14 , a motor 22 carried by the housing, a knife blade 26 having a cutting edge and carried by the housing for reciprocal motion generally normal to the base in response to operation of the motor, a presser foot 30 movably carried by the housing located in spaced relation to the blade cutting edge and movable toward and away from the base, and characterized by an elongated guard 100 connected to the presser foot and located closely adjacent the blade edge and guided supported in the hous ing for movement along the blade edge in response to movement of the presser foot toward and away from the base. The machine includes a manually operated arrange ment for turning the motor 22 on and automatically turning it off, functioning like a deadman switch. There is included an arrangement for releasing the presser foot 30 when the motor is turned off allowing the presser foot to rest on or near the base 14 and maintain the guard in place along the blade edge when the motor is off. The machine includes a sharpening mechanism 74 movably carried by the housing for travel in opposite directions along the blade 26 when it is to be sharpened, and the guard 100 is flexible to accommodate the presence of the sharpening mechanism. In response to movement of the presser foot 30 , the flexible guard moves along a first path closely adjacent the blade edge, a second path offset from the first path and defined in the machine housing and a third path joining the first and second paths and extending about along the sharpening mechanisms. During movement of the sharpening mecha nism 74 along the blade 26 , the flexible guard 100 is guided away from the blade by a guide 124 carried by the sharpener mechanism and is returned close to the blade edge as the sharpener returns to its rest position.
