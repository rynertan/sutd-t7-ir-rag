# Improved process for preparing water absorbing resins.

## Abstract
A hot aqueous solution is prepared first which comprises acrylic acid neutralized 70 to 100 mole percent, a water miscible or water soluble polyvinyl monomer, water and, when desired, an organic solvent having a boiling point of 40 to 150 C, and which contains the acrylate monomer and the polyvinyl monomer in a combined concentration of 30 to 80 wt. . To achieve the full advantage of the present invention, the acrylate and polyvinyl monomers are present in a com bined concentration of less than 70 in weight percent of the monomer solution. In accordance with another important embodiment of the present invention, the combined concen tration of the acrylate and polyvinyl monomers is less than 55 weight percent of the monomer solution.
