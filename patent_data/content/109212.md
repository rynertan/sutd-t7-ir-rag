# Process for the preparation of acids.

## Abstract
A carboxylic acid of formula RCO₂H where R is a C₁ to C₁₀ aliphatic hydrocaryl group is prepared by heating under substan tially anhydrous conditions an ester of formic acid of formula HCO₂R where R is a defined above in the presence of carbon monoxide and an effective amount of a catalyst system compris ing a Group VIII metal, a halide and a compound containing quaternary Group V atom. The quaternary Group V atom can be formed in situ by adding a compound containing a trivalent nitrogen, phosphorus or arsenic atom quaternisable under the reaction conditions and a quaternizing agent. Acetic acid is prepared by heating methyl formate in the presence of a catalyst system containing a rhodium compound, an iodide and a quater nary nitrogen containing heterocyclic base.
