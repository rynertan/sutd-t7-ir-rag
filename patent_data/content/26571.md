## Description
This invention relates to electrical systems in which a PTC device is used to protect a circuit against a thermal or electrical fault. PTC devices are electrical devices which contain an element having a positive temperature coefficient of resistance and which are converted to a high resistance state when they exceed a certain temperature. It is known to use PTC devices to protect electrical circuits against excessive temperatures and or against electrical faults, e.g. excessive current see for example U.S. Patents Nos.2,978,665 and 3,243,753, U.K Application Nos. 2,036,754A, 2,038,550A, 2,038,549A and ThePTC Resistor by R.F. Blaha in Proceedings of the ElectronicComponents conference, 1971. The present invention relates to electrical systems in which PTC devices are used in a novel way as circuit protection devices. In its first aspect, the invention provides an electrical system which comprises a a first circuit which is adapted to be connected to a source of electrical power and which includes a PTC device, and b a second circuit which includes a resistor which is thermally coupled to said PTC device the first and second circuits being such that when the first circuit is connected to a source of electrical power and a fault condition develops in one of the circuits, the temperature of said resistor increases substantially and converts said PTC device into a high resistance state, thus causing a desired change in the electrical condition of one or both circuits.The second circuit can include more than one resistor which is thermally coupled to the PTC device. In one preferred embodiment, the first circuit is a power circuit including an electrical load and the second circuit is a control circuit, and the result of a fault condition in the first circuit is that sufficient current flows through the second circuit to heat the resistor to a temperature which causes the PTC device to be converted into the high resistance state, thereby substantially reducing the current in the power circuit.The second circuit is preferably one which does not include a source of electrical power and in which, therefore, no current flows in the second circuit in the normal operating condition of the system. The current which flows in the second circuit when a fault condition occurs can be small, e.g. less than 200 milliamps, often less than 100 milliamps. Preferably the first circuit includes a first element which is separated from a second element of the second circuit by a member composed of a material which is an electrical insulator under normal conditions of operation but which becomes an electrical conductor when a fault condition develops in the first circuit. A particularly useful system of this kind is part of an electrical heating blanket, the first element being the heating wire for the blanket and the second element being a sensor wire adjacent the heating wire.Conventional heating blankets of this kind are disclosed in U.S. Patents No. 3,213,328, 3,396,265, 3,418,454, 3,437,792 and 3,814,899. In a second preferred embodiment, the second circuit is a power circuit which is adapted to be connected to a source of electrical power and which includes a switch, and the first circuit is a control circuit which includes a relay, the relay maintaining the switch in the second circuit in the closed position when the system is in the normal operating condition and the PTC device is in the low resistance state, and the relay opening the switch in the second circuit when a fault condition causes thePTC device to be converted into the high resistance state. The PTC device will often be at a temperature of 40 to 70 C in the normal operating condition of the system, and have a resistance of 0.01 to 1.0 ohm, preferably 0.05 to 0.5 ohm. Preferably the device will be converted to the high resistance state if its temperature exceeds the normal operating temperature by more than about 10 C., its resistance rising, for example, to a value in the range of 10 to 60 kilo ohms. Preferably the PTC device is latched in the high resistance state, i.e. remains in the high resistance state even after the fault condition has ceased to exist until current has ceased to flow through it and the device has cooled. The PTC devices used in the present invention preferably comprise a PTC element composed of a PTC conductive polymer composition, particularly suitable devices being those described in U.K. Application No. 2038550.. Such device are substantially superior in a number of respects to ceramic PTC devices, which typically have resistances greater than 2 ohms and cannot carry currents in excess of 500 milliamps. PTC conductive polymer devices are typically less than 30 mm, preferably less than 20 mm, in the largest dimension, with a thickness less than 10 mm, preferably less than 5 mm. The PTC device in the first circuit must be thermally coupled to the resistor in the second circuit.The resistor may be a component which is essential to the normal operation of the system. Alternatively, and often preferably, the resistor may be one which is inserted into the second circuit for the specific purpose of sensing a fault condition and which is unimportant to the normal operation of the system. In the interests of using a resistor of small size and low cost, the resistor is preferably one which has a power rating or rated dissipation of at most 3 watts, especially at most 1 watt, measured by the procedures recommended by the International Electrotechnical Commission see for example pages 13, 35 and 37 of IECPublication No. 115 1 . Such resistors are for example carbon composition, carbon film or wire wound resistors, typically tubular components of circular cross section with diameters from 1.5 to 12 mm and lengths from 3 to 50 mm. The thermal coupling between the PTC device and the resistor is preferably such that the trip time of thePTC device i.e. the time taken to convert the device to the high resistance state after the fault condition has occurred is less than 5 minutes, preferably less than 2 minutes. In any event, the trip time should be short enough to avoid permanent damage to any component of the system, including the resistor to which the PTC device is thermally coupled. In one embodiment, the device and the resistor are thermally coupled by means of a thermally conductive polymeric composi tion, e.g. a silicone or epoxy resin containing a thermally conductive filler the device and the resistor can be encapsulated in such a composition. However, such thermal coupling alone is often insufficient to give sufficiently short trip times, and it is preferred that the device and the resistor are thermally and optionally also mechanically coupled by means of a metal strap which at least partially encircles the two components. The metal strap preferably extends over at least 7, e.g. at least 20 , of the total surface area of the PTC device. The strap may be, for example, of copper or aluminum.The ratio of the largest cross sectional dimension of the resistor to the largest dimension of the PTC device coupled thereto by a metal strap may be for example 2 to 0.05. A thermally conductive polymeric composition can of course be used in addition to the metal strap. The invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which Figures 1 and 2 are schematic drawings of elec trical systems of the invention, and Figure 3 shows the thermal and mechanical coupling of a PTC device to a resistor. Referring now to Figure 1, this shows an electrical system for a heating blanket. Power circuit 17 comprises a heating wire 19 which extends throughout the area of the blanket to be heated and a PTC device 20 in series with heating wire 19.Control circuit 18 comprises a sensor wire 21, two diodes 22 and 22a and two resistors 23 and 23a. The sensor wire 21 is separated from the heating wire 19 by a material which is an insulator under normal operating conditions but which has a negative temperature coefficient of resistance such that when any portion of the blanket overheats, the material becomes conductive and permits significant current to flow from the heating wire 19 to the sensor wire 21 and thus through the control circuit 18. PTC device 20 is thermally coupled to resistors 23 and 23A by thermal coupling means 24 and 24a. When the blanket is in use, power circuit 17 is connected to an AC power source. Under normal operating conditions, current flows through the heating wire 19 and the PTC device 20, but is prevented from flowing through the resistors 23 and 23a by diodes 22 and 22a.However, when any portion of the blanket overheats, the material separating the heating wire 19 from sensor wire 21 becomes conductive and current flows to the sensor wire and through the control circuit, including resistors 23 and 23a. Heat generated by the flow of current through resistors 23 and 23a is transferred by thermal coupling means 24 and 24a to PTC device 20, causing the PTC device to heat and thus to change to a high resistance state. In the high resistance state, the resistance of the PTC device is sufficiently high to significantly reduce current through the power circuit and prevent overheating of the blanket. It will be noted that in this type of system, the PTC device can be physically remote from the load which it protects in Figure 1, the heating wire . Referring now to Figure 2, control circuit 8 comprises a PTC device 7 and a relay 9. Power circuit 13 comprises a resistive load 12 which is thermally coupled toPTC device 7 by thermal coupling means 11 and a switch 10 which is controlled by relay 9. In use of the system, the control circuit is connected to a first power supply, thus energizing the relay 9 and closing the switch 10. The power .circuit is connected to a second power supply. If a fault condition occurs in the power circuit which cause the resistor 12 to overheat, e.g. an excessive current, this converts the PTC device to the high resistance state, reducing the current in the control circuit and deenergising the relay to cause the switch 10 to open. The term relay is used herein to include any component which controls the opening and closing of the switc in the power circuit depending on the current passing through the relay. For example, in a system similar to that shown in Figure 2, the PTC device can be placed in parallel with a relay which opens the switch in the power circuit when the current through the relay is increased. Referring now to Figure 3, this is an exploded view of a PTC device 14, a resistor 15 and a metal strap 16 which is used to mechanically and thermally couple device 1 and resistor 15. The invention is further illustrated by the following Example. EXAMPLE This Example simulates the behavior of a PTC device and a pair of resistors thermally coupled thereto when an electrical system as in Figure 1 is subject to a fault condition resulting from overheating of a part of the heating blanket. The PTC resistor was placed in a power circuit which also included a 230 volt AC power source and a 400 ohm. resistor equivalent to the heating wire of the blanket , the current in the circuit being 0.575 amp. The resistors were connected in parallel in a control circuit including a 27 volt DC power source and a variable resistor so that the current through the resistors could be carried to produce the desired level of power consumption therein. The PTC device consisted of a PTC element in the form of a disc 1.9 cm in diameter and 0.2 cm thick, with an electrode of nickel plated copper mesh embedded in each face. The PTC element was composed of a dispersion of carbon black in a blend of high density polyethylene and an ethylene acrylic acid copolymer. The resistance of the PTC device in its low resistance state was 0.1 ohm and in its high resistance state was about 106 ohm. The PTC device was encapsulated with epoxy resin or unencapsulated, as indicated for each test. Seven different tests were carried out, using different resistors and different thermal coupling means, as described below. In each test, two resistors were attached to the PTC device, one resistor on each side.In tests A and B, the resistors used were 1 watt, 1.25 x 0.5 cm cylindrical carbon composition resistors and thePTC devices were unencapsulated. In tests C, D, E, F and G, the resistors used were 1 watt, 1.43 x 0.5 cm cylindrical carbon film resistors and the PTC devices used were encapsulated. The resistors were thermally coupled to the PTC device as follows Test A The resistor was bonded to and electrically insulated from the PTC adhesive by an epoxy resin. Test B A strap of copper foil, 2.2 x 0.6 x 0.025 cm, was placed on each side of the PTC device so that it encircled the resistor and extended onto the surface of the PTC device. The strip and resistor were bonded to and electrically insulated from the PTC device with epoxy resin. Test C The resistors were attached as in Test B, and the entire unit was encap sulated with an epoxy resin. Test D Copper straps were positioned as in Test B. The two ends of each strap were bonded to the PTC device with epoxy resin, and thermal grease a silicone resin containing a heat conductive filler was applied to all interfaces between the copper strap, the resistor and the PTC device.Test E Copper straps were positioned as in test B and epoxy resin was applied to all interfaces between the copper strips, resistors and PTC device.Test F The PTC device and the resistors were encircled with a band of heat shrinkable polyethylene. Thermal grease was placed at the interfaces between the resistors and the PTC device. The band was heat shrunk to securely hold the resistors in contact with the PTC device.Test G The resistors were bonded to the PTC device with a small, amount of epoxy resin and thermal grease was applied to the interfaces between the resistors and the PTC device. In each test, the following Procedures 1 and 2 were followed.Procedure 1 The control circuit was adjusted so that each resistor was consuming about 2 watts current about 140 milliamps . The control circuit was disconnected as soon as the PTC device had tripped and the trip time was recorded.The power circuit was disconnected and the device allowed to cool before Procedure 2 was followed. The resistors did not suffer any damage in this procedure in any of the Tests. Procedure 2 One of the resistors in the control circuit was disconnected and the circuit was adjusted so that the remaining resistor was consuming about 7.5 watts. The control circuit was disconnected as soon as the PTC device had tripped and the trip time was recorded. The resistance of the resistor was measured, and it was found that in testA, F and G the resistance had dropped, from 100 ohms to 90 ohms in Test A and from 100 ohr, s to 97 ohms in Tests F and E. In Test F the.heat shrunk band smoked and split open during Procedure 2, and in Test G the epoxy joint failed during Procedure 2.
