## Description
METHOD OF FORMING A SPLINE AND A SPLINED CONNECTION Splined surfaces and splined connections are well known as are broaching methods for forming them.However, such prior art splined connections frequently have not perfectly matched and thus have permitted at least some degree of backlash between the connected components. Even for ideally matching splines, most materials have a tendency to distort slightly during operation, thereby permitting backlash. Over the lifetime of the splined components, the backlash tends to increase as wear between the components occurs. There are many uses of splined components where elimination of backlash is particularly important. One example is found in our U.S. Patent Specification No.3,951,481, which shows a drive unit having a splined hub located between a second fixed hub and bearings.In this unit it is desirable to maintain a precise loading on the bearings. However, because of the backlash of the splined hub, the hubs tend to rub together and wear down, thereby reducing the load applied through the hubs to the bearings. No. 3,951,481 discloses the use of a plurality of pins to apply the preload rather than the splined hub because of the wear which the hub incurs. In accordance with the invention, a splined connection between a first member and a second member comprises a tapered spline of the first member mating with an untapered spline of the second member. The invention also includes a method of forming a tapered spline on a first portion of a member about an axis, the method comprising deflecting the first portion of the member in the axial direction broaching the deflected first portion of the member to form an untapered spline on the first portion of the member and causing the member to reassume its undeflected condition. The invention thus provides the possibility of having a splined connection which allows substantially no backlash between the connected components. By providing one of the components with a tapered spline, an improved mating may be achieved which eliminates undesirable backlash, thereby preventing the wearing down of contacting surfaces. The elimination of wear in various situations also permits use of simpler and less time consuming methods of installing the splined components and further eliminates the need for induction hardening of the splined components. By distorting the element before forming the spline, a tapered spline may be formed by using conventional broaching tools and methods and enables the backlash free connection to be formed on existing parts where desirable with no other design change being required. An example of the formation of a tapered spline, and a splined connection, in accordance with the invention are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a sectional view of a hub in a distorted condition prior to broaching, the distortion shown being exaggerated Figure 2 is a sectional view of the hub in its distorted condition after broaching has occurred Figure 3 is a broken sectional view of the undistorted hub and a mating male spline, the taper of the female spline being exaggerated and, Figure 4 is a cross sectional view of an outboard planetary final drive unit containing a hub incorporating the splined connection. Figures 1 to 3 illustrated the steps employed in providing a tapered female spline 6 in a first member 7 for use in a backlash free splined connection 8 to a straight i.e. untapered male spline 9 of a second member 10. For convenience of illustration, but without restriction to the use which is described, the first member 7 is a hub 22, in which the internal spline 6 is cut. The hub 12 has a disc shaped body portion 11 with a radially outwardly directed flange 13 about the outer periphery thereof and a radially inwardly directed collar 15 having, as shown in Fig. 1, a cylindrically shaped wall 16 defining an axially directed hole or aperture 17 having a central axis 14. The central axis 14 extends perpendicular to the plane of the hub 12.Initially, external forces P,R are applied to distort the hub 12 along the central axis 14 as shown in exaggerated form in Fig. 1. The external force R at the perimeter of the flange 13 of the hub 12 is actually a reactive force which results when the flange 13 is abutted either against a fixed surface of a tool or jig for use in the broaching machine or against one jaw of a clamping device.The force P is a distorting force applied evenly about the axial periphery of the collar i5 of the hub 12 which, for example, could be applied by a movable surface of a tool or jig or by the second jaw of a clamping device The interior hole or aperture 17 of the hub 12 is splined, such as by broaching in a conventional manner with the direction of broaching being from the inwardly distorted side of the hub 12 to form the complete female spline 6 in the wall 16 of the collar 15 in a single pass.With the hub 12 distorted when the spline is machined into the collar 15, the female spline 6 thus formed is a uniform cylindrical spline as shown in Fig. 2. When the external forces P,R are thereafter removed, the hub 12 and collar 15 will return to an undistorted configuration, causing the spline 6 to be slightly tapered as shown in exaggerated form in Fig. 3. With the hub 12 distorted, the female spline 6 is broached at a diameter D1 which is equal to or slightly greater than D, the diameter of the male spline 9 Figure 3 . When the external loads P,R are removed, the diameter on the qssncave side of the distort ion increases to D2 while the diameter on the opposite side decreases to D3. The scale of these maximum and minimum diameters D2,D3 is such that 1 2 to 3 4 of the hub 12 may pass freely over the mating male spline 9. Thus, the taper is such that D2 D3 2 D D2 3D3 4. Resultingly, at least 1 4 of the female spline 6 is of a diameter slightly smaller than the male spline 9 and must be forced onto the male spline 9.By forcing the undersized portion of the female spline 6 over the male spline 9, a rigid connection between two components is created reducing or substantially eliminating backlash, a result which analytical studyhas shown would be exhibited by a tapered female spline. The distortion of the hub 12 by the external loads P,R is very slight Therefore, the hub 12 is not deflected beyond its elastic limit and automatically returns to its original shape after the external loads are removed. The resultant taper of the female spline 6 is also very slight. As an example, one hub was deflected and a spline was machined in the collar 15 thereof, resulting in a taper on the order of 0.1016mm per 25.4mm 0.004 inch per inch of spline length.Thus the maximum and minimum diameters D2,D3 are greater than and less than the male spline diameter D by only a few thousandths of an inch. This enables the undersized portion of the female spline 6 to be forced over the larger male spline 9, requiring only a small amount of distortion of the mating surfaces, well within their permissable distortion ranges. With the conventiona cylindrical splines, the only way to eliminate backlash is to form a virtually perfect mating of splined surfaces and use material which is highly resistant to deformation, as by case hardening. To do so would be very expensive. By using the tapered spline of this invention, the elimination of backlash can be achieved without requiring that the spline be broached to create a perfect match.Since a portion of the female spline 6 is smaller in diameter than the matching male spllne 9, the two splines must deform for the female spline 6 to pass around the larger male spline 9. This slight deforma tion work hardens the matching spline surfaces and results in a virtually perfect mating which is substantially free from backlash. A tapered male spline providing the improved backlash free mating of the above described embodiment may alternatively be formed to mate with a cylindrical female spline. The spline can be formed in essentially the same manner as the tapered female spline described above. If the element on which the male spline is formed is capable of being distorted appropriately i.e.is relatively thin in comparison to its diameter , broaching can be done in a conventional manner on the distortedgelement as above. In this case however, the element would be fixed at its cente when distorted. A hub having a slightly tapered spline as taught herein may be used in any machine or drive train where it is imperative that backlash.between spline connected parts be virtually eZiminated. One example of an outboard planetary final drive unit having such a requirement is shown in Figure 4. Power is input to this unit as shown generally at 18, the power being transmitted from an engine not shown through a drive mechanism also not shown to a first shaft 19. The first shaft 19 has a spline connection with a first gear 20, which first gear 20 meshes with and drives a second gear 22 having a spline connection with a drive shaft 24. Supporting the drive shaft 24 for rotation is a spindle 26 and a plurality of bearings 28. The spindle 26 is locked to the case assembly 32,34 by a plur ality of bolts 36. The proximal end 38 of the drive shaft 24 has gear teeth and acts as a sun gear 40. The sun gear 40 drives a plurality of planet gears, one of which is shol, n at 42. The planet gears 42 mesh with a fixed circumscribing ring gear 44. The ring gear 44 is fixed against rotation by a hub 12 which has a male spline 46 meshing with the ring gear 44 and a female spline 6 meshing with a mating male spline 9 on the spindle 26.Due to a need to eliminate backlash as detailed below , this female spline 6 is tapered to provide the improved mating heretofore described. The collar 15 containing the female spline 6 is secured against axial movement by a locking hub 48 which is secured to the end of the spindle 26 by a plurality of bolts 50. Each of the planet gears 42 has a rod 52 which is rotatable within bearings 54 inside the planet gear 42. Each rod 52 is rigi4 y fixed to the surrounding carrier 56, rotating the carrier 56 around the sun gear axis. For each rotation of the planet gear 42 around the sun gear 40, the rod 52 itself rotates one time around its own axis. The carrier 56 is rigidly connected to a drive sprocket 58 by plurality of bolts 60 so that the drive sprocket 58 rotates with the carrier 56. The drive sprocket 58 is supported for this rotation around the spindle 26 by a plurality of bearings 62,64. The drive sprocket 58 is the final element in the drive train and directly applies the power to its intended use. A typ ical use is to drive an endless articulated track having shoes for powered movement of a vehicle. It is desirable to establish a specific axial preload on the bearings 62,64 around the spindle 26 to prevent looseness and thus maintain optimum operation of the bearings 62,64. To accomplish this, the left set of bearings 62 in Figure 4 rests against an annular shoulder 66 and a preload is applied to the right set of bearings 64. The preload is applied by establishing a precise thickness to the collar 15 containing the female spline portion 6 of the hub 1 2 so that it applies the desired pressure to the right bearings 64 when the hub 12 is itself pressured to the left by the locking hub 48. A probability bearing adjusting method is used to preload the bearings which results in the majority of bearings 62,64 being loaded properly. The actual loading force is not measured but the correct force is established by proper axial sizing of the collar 15 of the female spline portion. This method is much simpler and less time consuming than prior preloading methods, requiring only that the locking hub 48 be secured to the end of the spindle 26. There is no need for shims, and, since this is a probability method, the locking hub 48 need not be adjusted for each bearing 64. Thus fewer bolts 50 are required to secure the locking hub 48 to the spindle 26. Because the probability bearing adjusting method requires that precise dimensions be maintained around the female spline 6 of the hub 12 to keep the proper preload applied during operation, it is desirable to eliminate all backlash of the female spline connection. In the prior art, slight backlash at this connection caused the hubs 12,48 to wear down, resulting in an undesirable decrease in the preload on the bearings 62,64. For this reason, the backlash free mating provided by the tapered spline of this invention is highly desirable at this location.
