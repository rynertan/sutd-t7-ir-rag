Thus, for example, the composition may be a shaped composition, such as a bolus, tablet or capsule. In such cases the pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable carrier will be chosen from the usual range of lubricants, dispersants, binders, fillers and the like. When these shaped compositions are for administration to cattle and pigs often they may for instance weigh at least 1 g, on occasions at least 2 g.For administration to humans, especially children, the drug may suitably be presented as a syrup including suitable colouring and or flavouring agents. Such syrups are conveniently presented in unit or multi dose containers.For veterinary use the composition may also be a dispersion or a solution of the drug in a suitable vehicle for use with an oral doser this is a well known item of farm equipment, basically comprising a liquid reservoir, a mouthpiece adapted for insertion into animals mouths, and a pump mechanism whereby unit doses can be ejected from the reservoir through the mouthpiece . Conveniently the drug may be administered from an oral doser as an aqueous solution.Alternatively, the vehicle will be an oil or water based cream to ensure homogeneity of the unit doses administered.The invention, therefore, also provides an oral doser containing a multi dose of the drug in a veterinarily acceptable vehicle.The drugs of the invention may also be added to the animal feed or drinking water. It will be convenient to formulate these animal feed and drinXing water compositions with a multi dose of the drug so that the animal takes in an appropriate quantity of the drug along with its diet. It will also be convenient to present the composition of the invention as a premix for addition to the feed or drinking water. With young animals, a particularly useful technique is to blend the drug with the milk provided for them.The compositions of the invention may also be formulated for injection. In such cases the drug chosen is suitably dissolved in water for injection.Alternatively the drug may be administered in a solution used for parenteral fluid replacement therapy.Treatment of diarrhoea and scours using the drug may be supplemented by oral rehydration therapy such as those described in U.K. Patent No. 1,581,826 and GermanOffenlegungsschrift No. 28 54 281, UK PatentApplication No. 2 012 163A, US Patent No. 3 898 328,Nalin, D.R. and Cash, R.A., Bull.

It is believed that a suitable dose of the drug for use in the present treatment, would be in the range 0.001 to lOmg kg, which dose may be repeated as and when required.Particularly suitable ranges include 0.01 to 2 mg kg and especially 0.05 to 2 mg kg. Nevertheless it will be appreciated that the dose used in practice will depend on the species to which the dose is administered and on the route of administration. Useful dosage units based on such dosage would contain from 0.001 mg to 100 mg of the drug, more suitably 0.05 mg to 100 mg. Of course, it will be appreciated that many preferred compositions of the invention are in multi dose form as, for the therapy of animals, it is often most desirable to be able rapidly to treat a number of animals. Such multi dose compositions will contain, by way of example, at least 1 mg of the drug.Depending on the exact nature of the said multi dose composition, often it will contain at least 25 mg of the drug, and on occasions as much as 2.5 g. Doses may be administered once or several times daily.Within the above indicated dosage ranges, no adverse toxicological effects have been observed with the compounds of the invention. The present invention further provides a method for treating diarrhoea or scours which comprises administering a compound of formula I , or an acid addition salt thereof, as hereinbefore defined, to a human or non human animal in need thereof.In a particular embodiment the invention provides a method for treating diarrhoea or scours which comprises administering a pharmaceutical or veterinary composition as hereinbefore defined, particularly an oral rehydration composition.The invention will now be illustrated by the followingExamples, Descriptions, Biological Data andFormulations.
