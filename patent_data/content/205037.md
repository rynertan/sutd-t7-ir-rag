# Safety belt buckle.

## Abstract
An improved subassembiy 36 can be used in either a top release buckle or an end release buckle. The subassembly includes an elongated metal base 40 . A latch bar 42 is pivotally supported in openings in side portions 132, 134 of the base 130 for movement between an engaged condition and a disengaged condition. A slide 50 is movable along the base 130 to move the latch bar 42 between the engaged and disengaged conditions and to hold the latch bar 42 in the engaged condition. The slide 50 has a pair of side sections 192, 194 which are engaged by either the actuator pad 24 of a top release buckle 20 or the actuator slide 32 of an end release buckle 28 . The side sections 192, 194 of the slide 50 have cam surfaces 208, 214 which move the latch bar 42 between the engaged and disengaged conditions. The side sections 192, 194 of the slide member have blocking surfaces 210 which hold the latch bar 42 in the engaged condition. An ejector member 54 ejects a safety belt tongue 22 from a buckle upon movement of the latch bar 42 to the disengaged condition and blocks movement of the latch bar 42 from the disengaged condition until the tongue 22 is again inserted into the buckle.
