# Ink dot printer.

## Abstract
An ink dot printer wherein an ink supply member 37 having both insulation property and ink impregnation prop erty is positioned in contact with conductive recording electrodes 36 disposed opposite to an opposed electrode 14 through a recording medium 15 , and ink is fed from the ink supply member to fore ends of the recording electrodes, so that a printing operation can be performed without soiling the recording medium. Accordingly the entire structure can be simplified and the ink fed to the fore ends of the recording electrodes is effectively kept undried.
