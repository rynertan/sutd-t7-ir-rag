# Metal coating a metallic substrate.

## Abstract
Aluminium is coated on steel strip. The steel strip is heated in hydrogen to reduce surface oxides to iron, and is then sprayed at 400 C with nitrogen atomised molten aluminium to a depth of 150 microns. Still in nitrogen hydrogen, at 350 C, the coated strip is rolled. Under these conditions, the aluminium is subjected to very high com pressive stress compared with its yield stress while the steel does not even reach its yield stress.
