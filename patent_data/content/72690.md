# A MIS device and a method of manufacturing it.

## Abstract
An MIS device having multilayer wiring has a lower layer wiring pattern 20c connected to a gate electrode 16 of an MIS transistor and to an upper layer wiring pattern 23 . The lower layer wiring pattern 20c which is connected to the gate electrode 16 is also connected, at least partly during manufacture of the device, to a semiconductor substrate 11 via a protection element 17c which has a conduction voltage smaller than the dielectric strength of the gate insulation film 15 . Thus, the gate insulation film 15 is prevented from being destroyed by the electric charges that accumulate in the lower wiring layer 20c connected to the gate electrode 16 during the formation of multilayer wiring.
