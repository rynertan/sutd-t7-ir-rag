# Photographing apparatus for endoscope.

## Abstract
A plurality of exposure constant selection switches SW₁₁ to SW₁₉ are provided for respectively corresponding exposure constants, and an intermediate one of these expo sure constants is automatically set in case when none of the exposure constants are selected by selection switches SW₁₁ to SW₁₉ . In case when two selection switches are operated at one time, an exposure constant corresponding to the average of the exposure constants selected by these two selection switches is automatically set.
