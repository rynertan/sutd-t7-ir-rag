# Ethylene copolymers with a high melt index and manufacture of containers with these.

## Abstract
An ethylene polymer having an improved processability particularly in injection moulding processes, has a density in the range of about 0.940 0.960, a melt index in the range 100 200 and preferably a ratio of weight average molecular weight to number average molecular weight of less than 5. The polymer is copolymer of ethylene and at least one Î± olefin having 4 10 carbon atoms, e.g. butene 1, hexene 1 or octene 1. The preferred polymer is a copolymer of ethylene and butene 1. The polymers may be used in the injection moulding of thin wall containers e.g. containers having a wall thickness of less than 0.7 mm, especially a thickness of less than 0.5 mm and in particular a thickness of less than 0.4 mm.
