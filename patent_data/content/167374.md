# CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION WAFER BOAT

## Abstract
A chemical vapor deposition wafer boat 2 for polysili con deposition in a vertical CVD apparatus comprises upper and lower, mutually engaging, open ended hemicylinders 4, 6 . Gas flow passageways 16 are present in a diffusion zone A of the lower hemicylinder wall, but not in the remainder of the walls of the hemicylinder. Gas flow to the wafers is limited to diffusion flow, and the wafers are protected from particulates forming in the gas stream during the coating operation.
