# Simplified electric switch construction.

## Abstract
A simplified electric switch construction is disclosed which comprises an insulating base 3 a switch cover 4 fitly placed on the base terminals 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b disposed on the base internal lead wires 16a, 16b, 17a, 17b opposed to each other and connected to the terminals a rocking type movable contact element 6 consisting of an electrically conductive plate and a push member 7 . The movable contact element has a gently curved belly portion 15 , reversely bent shoulder portions 14 on opposite sides of the belly portion, and contact ends 8a, 8b, 9a, 9b each shaped into a polygonal pyramidal form. The belly portion is centrally provided with a projection 12 . The movable contact element is mounted to the insulating base so as to be able to rock about the projection. The push member has a protrusion 13 that comes into abutting engagement with the projection from inside and an arm 13a interposed among the shoulder portions and the lower surface of the switch cover. The push member can be anchored at its neutral position. When the push member is moved to either one side of the internal lead wires, the protrusion of of this push member pushes the belly portion for bringing the contact ends into engagement with their respective internal lead wires, thereby exciting the terminals on that side. This switch construction can take the form of a switch which includes a printed board incorporating an electronic circuit.
