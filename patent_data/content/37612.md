# A method for the anaerobic conversion of solid organic material.

## Abstract
A solid organic material originating from plants or ani mals or both is subjected to an anaerobic treatment that con sists in at least 2 steps. In the first step a breakdown to a water soluble product and low molecular weight fatty acids occurs which are removed by rinsing with an aqueous liquid and fed to at least one auxiliary reactor. In the second step, a mixture of carbon dioxide and methane is formed from the organic material of said aqueous solution in said auxiliary reactor. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide and methane are formed from the water insoluble materials that are still present in the reaction space. The residue that remains in the reaction space has the properties of a stabilized compost.
