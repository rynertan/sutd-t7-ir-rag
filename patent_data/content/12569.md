# Preparation of naphtha by conversion of synthesis gas with a fluid catalyst which contains iron.

## Abstract
Process for converting synthesis gas in naphta by con tacting it at 260 315,55 C and 446,07 6996,09 kPa and at a GHSV of 400 20000 with a catalyst comprising a crystalline acidic aluminosilicate ZSM 5 having a silica to alumina ratio of at least 12, a pore size greater than 5Ã… and a constraint index of 1 to 12, a soliceous matrix and iron this catalyst is prepared by adding the zeolite to a siliceous hydrogel, homo genizing and spray drying the mixture and impregnating it with an iron salt e.g. the nitrate . The catalyst may contain clay.
