# CMOS D TYPE FLIP FLOP CIRCUITS

## Abstract
A CMOS D type flip flop circuit stage for avoiding the possibility of feedthrough includes a non overlapping clock generator section having a true clock output and a comple ment clock output. The flip flop circuit includes a master section formed of a first transfer gate, a first regenerative transistor and a first inverter gate. The flip flop circuit further includes a slave section formed of a second transfer gate, a second regenerative transistor and a second inverter gate. The clock generator provides a two phase non overlapping clock for clocking both the master and slave sections so as to prevent inadvertent racethrough of data input to successive stages.
