## Description
NOVEL PESTICIDAL HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS This invention relates to novel N substituted nitromethylene heterocyclic campounds, to a process for their preparation and to pesticidal compositions containing then Nitromethylene heterocyclic compounds are known to possess an interesting level of insecticidal activity see for example UK Patent Specification 1.513.951 in which the following compound is particularly exemplified EMI1.1 Hitherto N substituted derivatives of Compound A and analogues thereof have been synthesised by derivatising the heterocyclic compound A or its analogues see for example UK 1.513.951 page 5 lines 55 61. However attempts to synthesise certain N acyl derivatives by the direct acylation of Compound A and its analogues failed to yield the desired derivatives. moreover the synthesis of Compound A involved the use of hazardous intermediates and thus a route to N acyl derivatives avoiding Couund A was desirable. The Applicant has found a new process for the manufacture of N substituted derivatives of Compound A and its analogues which process avoids the need to use the heterocyclic intermediate Compound A. As well as producing known compounds this new process yields a class of insecticidally active novel compounds which form the subject of the present invention. Accordingly the present invention provides N substituted nitromethylene heterocyclic compounds of the following general formula EMI2.1 wherein n is 2,3 or 4 and R is an acyl group selected from the following groups each of which may be optionally substituted aroyl, carbamoyl, aryloxycarbonyl, alkylthiocarbonyl, ally lthio thiocarbonyl, arylthio thiocarbonyl, arylsulphonyl, allylsuiphinyl, arylsulphinyl, alkylaminosulphonyl, arylaminosulphonyl, alkylaminosulphinyl, arylaminosulphinyl, and a phosphorus containing acyl group of the following formula EMI2.2 wherein each RO independently is an optionally substituted alkyl or aryl group, each X independently is an oxygen or sulphur atan and each y independently is 0 or 1. Any aliphatic group present in an acyl group represented byR preferably contains up to 30 carbon atoms, more preferably up to 20 carbon atcms, often however the carbon content can be up to 8 or up to 4 carbon atoms. An aryl group present in the acyl group is preferably a phenyl group. The optional substituents which may be present in an acyl group represented by R are preferably selected from fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine nitro cyano alkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, alkenyl and alkynyl preferably of up to 6 carbon atoms and aryl, aryloxy and arylthio, preferably phenyl, phenoxy and phenylthio, optionally substituted with one or more groups selected from fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodineC 1 4 alkyl, nitro and cyano. Preferably n is 3. More specifically the prefered compounds according to the invention have the general formula I in which n 3 and R is optionally substituted aroyl for example benzoyl or halobenzoyl, optionally substituted arylsulphonyl for example phenylsulphonyl or halophenylsuiphonyl, dialkoxy oxophosphorus or dialkoxy thiophosphorus in which each alkyl group preferably contains 1 to 4 carbon atoms, diaryloxy oxophosphorus wherein each aryl is preferably phenyl, or dialkylcarbairajl or dialkylaminosulphonyl in which each alkyl group contains 1 to 4 carbon atoms. It will be appreciated that the compounds of formula I are capable of existing in different geometrically isomeric forms.The invention includes the individual isomers and mixtures of such isomers. The compounds according to the invention may be prepared by a new process which comprises reacting an N substituted S substituted arninothiol of the following general formula EMI3.1 wherein R and n have the rreanings specified hereinbefore and Hal is a halogen atam, with a base, preferably one selected from an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydride or alkoxide or an alkali metal amid, in the presence of an inert solvent.Suitable bases for use in this process are sodium or potassium hydride, sodium or potassium alkoxide in which the alkyl group contains 1 to 8 carbon atoms and is preferably branched e.g. a tertiary alkyl group, and sodium, potassium or lithium asides or dialkylamides wherein each alkyl group contains 1 to 8 carbons atans e.g. sodamide and sodium di isopropylamide. Any suitable solvent may be used, for example tertiary alcohols e.g. tertiary butanol, ethers e.g. diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, and drurethoxyethane, ketones e.g. acetone, nitrogenous solvents e.g. dimethylformamide, hydrocarbons e.g.benzene, xylene, and toluene, and sulphur containing solvents, e.g. dimethyl sulphoxide. The reaction may proceed at room temperature but in general it can take place at temperatures between 300 and 5O0C, suitably between 200 and 300C. The molar ratio of the reactants is unimportant, for example the molar ratio of base to aminothiol can be in the range 1 2 to 2 1 but generally speaking it is preferred to have the basic reactant in excess, e.g. the molar ratio is preferably in the range 1 1 to 2 1. The N substituted S substituted aminothiol starting materials of general formula II in the process according to the invention are novel ccnpcunds. They may be prepared by a process which comprises reacting an aminothiol of the general formulaEMI4.1 wherein R and n have the meanings hereinbefore specified with a halonitroethylene of the general formulaEMI4.2 wherein Hal is a halogen atom in the presence of a base, preferably a weaker base than that used in the preparation of the heterocyclic compound of general formula I, for example a hydroxide, carbonate, bicarhonate or acetate of an alkali or alkali earth metal or of ammonium and in the presence of an inert solvent.Conveniently the base is an alkali metal hydroxide such as sodium or potassium hydroxide. The inert solvent can be any of the solvents referred to hereinbefore. It is generally preferred to isolate the aminothiol of general formula II before subjecting it to the action of a base to form the heterocyclic compound I. However isolation of the intermediate II is inessential and the heterocyclic compound can be made directly without isolation of the intermediate II by reacting the aminothiol III with the halonitroethylene IV in the presence of base. The aminothiol compounds of general formula III may be prepared by N acylation of the corresponding unsubstituted aminothiol. As mentioned above the N substituted nitranethylene heterocyclic compounds of the invention are of interest as pesticides particularly against insect pests. They exhibit activity against such pests as the larval caterpillar or worm forms of insects, for examples, of the genus Spodoptera and of the genus Heliothis, and are particularly useful against pests found in rice crops. The compounds also exhibit acceptable stability towards light and oxidation. Accordingly the invention includes a pesticidal composition comprising an N substituted nitratethylene heterocyclic compound of general formula I together with a carrier. Such a composition may contain a single compound or a mixture of several compounds of the invention. It is also envisaged that different isomers or mixtures of isomers may have different levels or spectra of activity and thus compositions may comprise individual isomers or mixtures of isomers. The invention further provides a method of combating pests at a locus, particular insect pests at a locus infested, or liable to infestation, by such pests, which comprises applying to the locus a pesticidally effective amount of compound or composition according to the present invention. A carrier in a composition according to the invention is any material with which the active ingredient is formulated to facilitate application to the locus to be treated, which may for example be a plant, seed or soil, or to facilitate storage, transport or handling. A carrier may be a solid or a liquid, including a material which is normally gaseous but which has been compressed to form a liquid, and any of the carriers normally used in formulating pesticidal compositions may be used. Preferably oampositions according to the invention contain 0.5 to 95 by weight of active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers include natural and synthetic clays and silicates, for example natural silicas such as diatamaceous earths magnesium silicates, for example talcs magnesium aluminium silicates, for example attapulgites and vermiculites aluminium silicates, for example kaolinites, nrontanrrrillonites and micas calcium carbonate calcium sulphate ammonium sulphate synthetic hydrated silicon oxides and synthetic calcium or aluminium silicates elements, for example carbon and sulphur natural and synthetic resins, for example coumarone resins, polyvinyl chloride, and styrene polymers and copolymers solid polychloroohenols bitumen waxes and solid fertilisers, for example superphosphates. Suitable liquid carriers include water alcohols, for example isopropanol and glycols ketones, for example acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone ethers arctic or araliphatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene and xylene petroleum fractions, for example kerosine and light mineral oils chlorinated hydrocarbons, for example carbon tetrachloride, perchloroethylene and trichloroethane. Mixtures of different liquids are often suitable. Agricultural compositions are often formulated and transported in a concentrated form which is subsequently diluted by the user before application. The presence of small amounts of a carrier which is a surface active agent facilitates this process of dilution. Thus preferably at least one carrier in a composition according to the invention is a surface actie agent. For example the composition may contain at least two carriers, at least one of which is surface active agent. A surface active agent may be an emulsifying agent, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent it may be nonionic or ionic. Examples of suitable surface active agents include the sodium or calcium salts of polyacrylic acids and lignin sulphonic acids the condensation of fatty acids or aliphatic amines or amides containing at least 12 carbon atoms in the molecule with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide fatty acid esters of glycerol, sorbitan, sucrose ce pentaerythritol condesnates of these with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide condensation products of fatty alcohol or allyl phenols, for example P octylphenol or Eroctylcresol, with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide sulphates or sulphonates of these condensation products alkali or alkaline earth metal salts, preferably sodium salts, of sulphuric or sulphonic acid esters containing at least 10 carbon atoms in the molecule, for example sodium lauryl sulphate, sodium secondary alkyl sulphates, sodium salts of sulphonated castor oil, and sodium alkylaryl sulphonates such as dodecylbenzene sulphonate and polymers of ethylene oxide and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The composition of the invention may, for example, be formulated as a wettable powder, a dust, granules, a solution, an emulsifiable concentrate, an emulsion, a suspension concentrate or an aerosol. The composition may have controlled release properties. Wettable powders usually contain 25, 50 or 75 of active ingredient and may contain, in addition to inert solid material, 3 10 w of a dispersing agent and, where necessary, 0 10 w of a stabilizer, a penetrant and or a sticker. A dust is usually formulated as a dust concentrate having a composition similar to that of a wettable powder but without a dispersant, and is diluted in the field with further solid carrier to give a composition usually containing 10 w of active ingredient. Granules usually have a size in the range of from 10 to 100 BS Iresh 1.676 0.152 mm and may be manufactured by agglomeration or impregnation techniques. Generally, granules will contain 75 w active ingredient and 0 10 w of additives, such as stabilizers, surfactants, slow release modifiers and binding agents. Emulsifiable concentrates usually contain, in addition to a solvent, and, when necessary, co solvent, 10 50 w v active ingredients, 2 20 w v emulsifier and 0 20 w v of other additives, for example a stabilizer, a penetrant and or a corrosion inhibitor.A suspension concentrate is a stable, non sedimenting, flowable product and usually contains 10 75 w active ingredient, 0.5 15 w of dispersing agent, 0.1 10 w of suspending agent, for example protective colloid and or a thixotropic agent, and 0 10 w of other additives including, for example, a defoamer, a corrosion inhibitor, a stabilizer, a penetrant and or a sticker, and as dispersant, water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is substantially insoluble certain organic additives and or inorganic salts may be dissolved in the dispersant to assist in preventing sedimentation or as anti freeze for water. The aqueous dispersions and emulsions formed by diluting a wettable powder or an emulsifiable concentrate of the invention with water, also lie within the socpe of the present invention.Such dispersions and emulsions may be of the water in oil or of the oil in water type, and may have a thick mayonnaise like consistency. A composition of the invention may also contain other ingredients, for example, one or more other ccnrpounds possessing pesticidal properties. Further insecticidal compounds may be included, particularly such compounds having a different mode or spectrum of activity. The thermal stability of the compounds and compositions of the invention may be improved by the addition of stabilizing amounts, usually 10 100 w based on the carpound of certain organo nitrogen compounds such as urea, dialkylureas, thiourea or guanidine salts or alkali metal salts of weak acids such as hicarbonates, acetates or benzoates.
