# Poly ester amide derived from dihydroxy anthraquinone, hydroxybenzoic acid, dicarboxylic acid and aromatic monomer capable of forming an amide linkage.

## Abstract
A melt processable poly ester amide which is capable of forming an anisotropic melt phase is provided. The poly ester amide of the present invention consists essential ly of the recurring units a dioxyanthraquinone moiety, b p oxybenzoyl moiety, c dicarboxyl moiety, as defined, and d aromatic moiety capable of forming an amide linkage in the polymer, in the proportions indicated. Preferably, the moiety capable of forming an amide linkage is derived from p aminophenol or p phenylenediamine. The resulting poly ester amide exhibits a melting temperature below approximately 400 C., preferably below approximately 350 C. The poly ester amide of the present invention is preferably formed by a melt polymerisation technique.
