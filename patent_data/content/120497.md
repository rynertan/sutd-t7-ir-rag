# Shell and tube heat exchanger.

## Abstract
The heat exchanger of the shell and tube type includes end assemblies for venting fluid from the safety gaps of a plurality of multi walled vented tubes. A telescoping arrangement of fluid flow tubes and inner sleeves associated with the end assemblies provides reliable sealing thereof. Baffling arrangements within the end assemblies and within a heat transfer chamber create an advantageous multi pass contraflow between the heat exchange fluids.
