# COOKING DEVICE.

## Abstract
This cooking device performs a more effective and precise data protection of a non volatile memory 24 which is capable of writing electrically when the memory 24 is utilized for the cooking device for heating or cooking, and rewriting and collating the data during reading which comprises a protection circuit for preventing damage to the data in the memory 24 whether or not the power is on, and a main controller 19 for periodically rewriting the data in the memory and which protects the data against damage and ageing changes. When data in the memory 24 is read out, at least twice collations are performed and during writing, the data is read out immediately after the writing, thereby collating the RAM data in the controller 19 to protect the data strongly against noise.
