# REMOTELY CONTROLLABLE INSPECTION CAMERA APPARATUS

## Abstract
Remotely controllable inspection apparatus intended for use in inaccessible, confined spaces such as pipe interiors, especially sewer pipe interiors, has an articulated arm 32 supporting a closed circuit television camera 52 at its distal end. The arm 32 is pivotally mounted on a carriage 24 which is itself longitudinally slidable on a sledge 10 . The arm 32 can be elevated about a first, horizontal pivot axis 34 , a distal portion 54 of the arm 32 can be swung to one side or the other about a second pivot axis 58 , an outer part of the distal portion 54 is rotatable about a longitudinal axis 80 , and the camera 52 can be swivelled on the end of the arm 32 about a transverse swivel axis 76 . The range of movements provided allows the camera 52 to be posi tioned off axis in a pipe and gives a remote operator the ability to inspect the wall of the pipe at close range and to view the interior of lateral branches where they join the pipe. The movement functions described above are all controlled hydaulically for reliability and resistance to immersion in water. The invention includes hydraulic devices for perform ing these functions, as well as a hydraulically controlled focussing mechanism for the camera 52 .
