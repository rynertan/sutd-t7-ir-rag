# Coffee extract decaffeination method.

## Abstract
A method of decaffeinating caffeine containing liquids and particularly aqueous coffee extracts is disclosed. Caffeic acid is added to a caffeine containing aqueous coffee extract so as to form an insoluble, colloidal caffeic acid caffeine complex. Crystals of the insoluble caffeic acid caffeine complex are then grown and subsequently separated from the aqueous decaffeinated coffee extract. The coffee extracts intended for use herein include both roasted and green coffee extracts.
