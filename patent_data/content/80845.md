# Coaxial connector assembly.

## Abstract
A quick connect disconnect connector assembly for electrically coupling two ends of a coaxial circuit configura tion is described. The connector assembly comprises a male plug assembly of conventional construction and a novel mating female receptacle assembly. The male plug assembly comprises an electrically conductive inner conductor pin member for electrical connection to a coaxial circuit inner conductor, and an electrically conductive outer conductor member, electrically isolated from and surrounding the electrically conductive inner conductor pin member, for electrical connection to the coaxial circuit outer conductor shield. The female receptacle assembly comprises a bore of generally complementary profile for accommodating the male plug assembly, and includes an electrically conductive inner conductor contact assembly for receiving and contact ing the male plug assembly inner conductor pin member and for electrical connection to a coaxial circuit inner conductor, and an electrically condutive outer contact member electric ally isolated from and surrounding the electrically conduc tive inner conductor contact assembly, for receiving and contacting the male plug outer conductor member and for electrical connection to the coaxial circuit outer conductor shield. The female receptacle assembly outer contact mem ber includes a resiliently flexible, electrically conductive spring contact member which is normally displaced in part from contact with the interior profile of the bore formed in the female receptacle assembly, and which, upon engage ment of the male plug assembly flexes outwardly in contact with the male plug assembly electrically conductive outer conductor member to provide continuous, i.e. circumferen tial 360 electrical contact of the outer conductor contacts even under conditions of connector misalignment and or incomplete seating.
