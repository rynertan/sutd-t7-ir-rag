# Optical system for scanning with laser beam.

## Abstract
A scanning optical system comprises a gas laser 1a beam source for emitting a laser beam which causes a stimulable phosphor 5a sheet carrying a radiation image stored therein to release the stored energy of the radiation as light emission, optical members for scanning the stimulable phosphor sheet 5a with the laser beam, and a beam expander 2a positioned between the optical members and the gas laser 1a beam source. The angle of incidence 0 of the laser beam is adjusted by the optical members so that the direction of the incident laser beam is always different from the direction normal to the surface of the stimulable phosphor sheet 5a . Thus the laser beam reflected by the stimulable phosphor sheet is prevented from being fed back along the same optical path as that of the incident laser beam.
