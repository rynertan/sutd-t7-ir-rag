# FIRING PIN LOCKING DEVICE

## Abstract
A semi automatic pistol 10 has a breech slide 14 for chambering a cartridge 32 . The breech slide carries an inertia type firing pin 18 which is displaced to fire the chambered car tridge by a hammer 26 . An axially movable trigger assembly 42 functions to displace a sear 34 to release the hammer when the trigger assembly is moved to the pulled position. The hammer has a safety surface 46 which performs the function of a half cocked notch but engages the sear near the fired position so that a falling of the hammer after disengagement of the sear and the safety surface will not cause the firing pin to fire a cartridge. A firing pin lock 20 is mounted in the breech slide for vertical movement between a lower pin locking posi tion and an upper position in which the pin is free to travel. A pair of operatively interconnected levers 70,76 respond to movement of the trigger assembly to the pulled position and simultaneously move the lock to the upper position.
