# A sewing machine for fancy seams.

## Abstract
A sewing machine 10 is provided with an electronic memory 29 for the storing of codes which determine the shape of seams. The seams are divided into portions, seam elements. By way of reflecting seam elements such as inversion of left to right of the needle s zig zag positions or reverse of the feeding, it is possible to obtain several reflected images of the normal shape of the seam element. Moreover, by the invention a backward addressing in the memory is introduced, whereby the number of pattern variations essentially increases without the occupation of greater memory capacity. The backward addressing is enabled by a reversible address counter 24 to the memory, i.e. the counter can step forwards as well as backwards.
