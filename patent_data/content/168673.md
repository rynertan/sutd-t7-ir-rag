# Laser beam welding apparatus.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a beam machining, such as laser welding, apparatus having a machining chamber 108 , and means 204 for directing a machining beam onto a work piece within the chamber, the latter being supplied with an inert gas throughout each machining operation. The machining chamber 108 has associated therewith particle collecting and removal means 236, 256 including a gas collecting manifold 240 , and has further associated therewith sealing means 156, 244 operable in two states, one for allowing gas exiting the chamber to freely escape, as when the chamber is being purged of air and moisture, and the other for constraining all gas and particulate matter from the chamber to flow into the manifold, while beam machining is in progress.
