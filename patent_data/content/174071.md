## Description
DIHYDROPYRIDINE DEXARTrES AND THEIR PRODUCTION, FORMULATIONAND USE AS PHARMATEUTICALS This invention relates to new compounds, methods for their preparation and compositions containing them. A wide variety of dihydropyridines, e.g. those described in US Patent No 3,325,505, have been described as being useful as pharmaceuticals and some, notably nifedipine, have been sold for this use. We have now found a new group of pyridine derivatives which have pharmacological activity. According to the invention we provide compounds of formula I,EMI1.1 in which R2 and R3, which may be the same or different, each represent alkyl C1 to 6 or cycloalkyl C3 to 8, R7 and R8, which may be the same or different, each represent alkyl C1 to 6 optionally substituted by halogen, and X, Y and Z, which may be the same or different, are each hydrogen, halogen, nitro or alkyl C1 to 6 optionally substituted by halogen, or Z is as defined above and X and Y, together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached, form a C5 to 8 carbocyclic ring, other than a benzene ring, provided that when R2, R3, R7 and R8 are all methyl and X and S are.hydrogen or when R2 and R3 are both ethyl, R7 and R8 are both methyl and X and Z are hydrogen then Y is other than methyl. According to the invention we also provide the compounds of formula I for use as pharmaceuticals. According to the invention we further provide a process for the production of a compound of formula I which comprises a reaction of a compound of formula II, YZ C CXCHO II either with a compound of formula III or with compounds of formulae III and IV, R200CCH C R7 NE2 III 300CCH2COR8 IV in which formulae Y,Z,X, R2, R3, R7 and R8 are as defined above, b reaction of a compound of formula V, YZC CX CH C COOR3 COR8 in which Y, Z, X, R3 and R8 are as defined above, with a compound of formula III, or c production of an optical isomer of a compound of formula I by resolution of a mixture of optical isomers of the compound. The reaction of process a may be carried out by subjecting the compounds of formulae II, III and IV to an elevated temperature, eg of from about 200 and 1400C in the presence or absence of a suitable solvent, eg a lower alkanol or dimethylformamide. Alternatively the compound of formula II may be reacted with two moles of the compound of formula III to produce a symmetrical compound. Processes b may be carried out under similar conditions to process a . Process c may be carried out using conventional processes known per se. The starting materials for the above processes are either known, or if they are not specifically known they may be made by processes described in the Examples, or they may be made from known compounds using one or more process steps which are known per se or are analogous to those described in the Examples. The compounds of formula I and the intermediates therefor may be isolated from their reaction mixtures using conventional processes, eg crystallisation or chromatography. The compounds of formula I, are useful because they exhibit pharmacological properties in animals. More particularly they block the entry of calcium into vascular and cardiac muscle leading to falls in blood pressure, inotropy and heart rate. They. are active in the following systems a Relaxation of contracted vascular smooth muscle. Van Breeman, Aaronson, Loutzenhiser and Meisheri,Chest, 78, Supplement, 157 165, 1980. b Reduction of inotropy and chronotropy of isolated atria. Henry, .Excerpta Med. Int. Congr. Ser., 474, 14 23, 1979. c Reduction of blood pressure and increase cardiac output in anaesthetised dogs. Hirakawa, Ito,Kondo, Watanbe, Hiei, Banno Hyase, Arzneim Forsch, 22, 344 349, 1972. d Reduction of blood pressure in conscious dogs when given by the intravenous and oral routes. Newman,Bishop, Peterson, Leroux Horowitz, J Pharm. Exp. Ther.201, 723 730, 1977. The compounds are thus indicated for use in the treatment of renovascular, malignant or essential hypertension including hypertensive emergencies , pulmonary hypertension, vasospastic angina, chronic stable angina and congestive heart failure. Other indications are the treatment of renal failure, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, cerebrovascular diseases including cerebral haemorrhage, ischaemia and vasospasm, migraine, altitude sickness and hearing loss , peripheral vascular diseases including Raynaud s syndrome, intermittent claudication and digital ulceration use as a cardioplegic agent during surgery, e.g. in cardiopulmonary bypass, and for the treatment of, and protection against, myocardial infarction and ischaemia. By virtue of their ability to inhibit calcium entry into other cells and tissues the compounds are also indicated in the treatment of thrombosis, atherosclerosis, respiratory diseases including asthma and bronchitis glaucoma, aldosteronism, uterine hypermotility and for the relief of oesophageal and skeletal muscle spasm. For the above uses the dosage will depend upon the compound used, the route of administration and the effect desired, but in general will be in the range of O.l lOmg per kilogram body weight per day. For man the indicated total daily dose will be from about 5 500mg, preferably from 5 to 200mg and more preferably from 5 to 100mg, which may be administered preferably once daily, or in divided doses of about 1 200mg, preferably 2 to 25mg, e.g. 2 to 4 times per day. The compounds of formula I are advantageous in that they possess greater potency e.g. with respect to hypotensive and direct negative chronotropic effects , produce a lower level of reflex tachycardia, are more selective e.g. for vascular smooth muscle vs cardiac muscle , produce less depression of cardiac contractility, are longer acting, are more readily absorbed or less readily metabolised, are more easily formulated, possess less, or less undesirable, side effects, are more stable or have other more beneficial properties than known compounds of similar structure. The compounds of the invention may be administered by a wide variety of routes and may act systemically or locally. Thus the compounds may be administered by oral or nasal inhalation to the lung, to the buccal cavity, oesophageally, rectally, topically to the skin, the eye or to other available surfaces of the body by injection, e.g. intravenously, intramuscularly, intraperitoneally, or by surgical implant. We prefer R2 and R3 to be selected from methyl, ethyl, l methylethyl, cyclobutyl and cyclopentyl. We particularly prefer R2 to be l methylethyl, cyclobutyl or cyclopentyl and R3 to be methyl. We prefer R7 andR8 to be selected from methyl and monofluoromethyl, and especially for R7 to be methyl and R8 to be monofluoromethyl. Z may be fluoro, chloro, bromo, CF3, NO2 or methyl X may be fluoro, chloro, methyl or hydrogen Y may be CF3, fluoro, chloro, methyl, NO2 or hydrogen or X and Y may together form a CH2 n chain in which n is 3 or 4. When X and Y, together with the carbon atoms to which they are attached, form a cartocyclic ring that ring may be a bridged ring, e.g. a ring of formula,EMI7.1 in which Z is as defined above, and A is CH2 or CH2CH2 According to our invention we also provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising preferably less than 80 , more preferably less than 50 , e.g. 1 to 20 , by weight of a compound of formula I, in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier. Thus the compound may be put up as a tablet, capsule, dragee, suppository, suspension, solution, injection, implant, a topical, e.g. transdermal, preparation such as a gel, cream, ointment, aerosol or a polymer system, or an inhalation form, e.g. an aerosol or a powder formulation. We prefer compositions which are designed to be taken oesophageally and to release their contents in the gastrointestinal tract. Thus we prefer tablets which may, for example, be made by direct compression. In such a process the active ingredient is mixed with one or more of modified forms of starch, calcium phosphate, a sugar, e.g . lactose, microcrystalline cellulose and or other directly compressible exc ipients, together with lubricant s , e.g. stearic acid or magnesium stearate, flow aid s , e.g. talc or colloidal silicon dioxide, and disintegrant s , e.g. starch, substituted sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, cross linked.sodium carboxy methyl cellulose, carboxy methyl starch and cross linked polyvinylpyrrolidone. Tablets are then formed by direct compression, and may be sugar or film coated, e.g. with hydroxpropylmetbylcellulos e. Alternatively the active ingredient may be granulated before tabletting. In such cases the active ingredient is mixed with one or more of starch, calcium phosphate, a sugar, e.g. lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or other suitable excipients and granulated with a binder such as starch, pregelled starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatine, a modified gelatine, or a cellulose derivative, e.g.hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. The mass is then dried, sieved and mixed with lubricant s , flow aid s and disintegrant s , such as described in the previous paragraph. Tablets are then formed by compression of the granules, and may be sugar or film coated, e.g. with hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. As a further alternative a powder, blend or granules, such as are described above as intermediates in tab letting, may be filled into a suitable, e.g. gelatine, capsule. In order to improve the bioavailability, or decrease variability of availability, of the active ingredient the compound may be a dissolved in a suitable solvent, e.g. polyethylene glycol, Gelucaire, arachis oil, a hydrogenated vegetable oil or beeswax and the solution is then filled into a gelatine capsule, b produced as a spray dried or freeze dried form prior to mixing with other excipients, c milled and or micronised to produce a powder with a large surface area prior to mixing with other excipients, d made into a solution and distributed over an inert excipient having a large surface area, e.g. colloidal silicon dioxide. The solvent is evaporated and further excipients added, e formed into a complex with cyclodextrin prior to mixing with other excipients. This complex also assists in increasing light stability, or f made into a solid solution or co precipitated, e.g. with polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethyleneglycol, modified cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, urea or a sugar prior to mixing with further excipients. The compounds, either in their normal form or in a modified form, e.g as described immediately above, may be formulated in a controlled release form. Thus the compound may be dispersed, or contained in, a polymer matrix formed from, for example, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose or an acrylate methacrylate polymer. Alternatively the compound may be formulated as a tablet or beads which are surrounded by a semi permeable membrane, e.g. shellac, ethylcellulose or an acrylate methacrylate polymer. The compounds of this invention may be given in combination with other pharmaceutically active compounds, e.g. diuretics, beta blockers, antihypertensives 6r inotropic agents. The dosage of the other pharmaceutically active compound can be that conventionally used when the compound is administered on its own, but is preferably somewhat lower.To illustrate these combinations, a compound of this invention effective in the range, e.g. 5 100 milligrams per day, can be combined at levels ranging. e.g. from 1 200 milligrams per day with the following beta blockers, antihypertensives and diuretics in dose ranges per day as indicated hydrochlorothiazide 15 200mg , chlorothiazide l25 2000mg , ethacrynic acid 15 lOOmg , amiloride 5 20mg , furosemide 5 80mg , propanolol 20 480mg , timolol 5 50mg , captopril 10 500mg , methyldopa 65 2000mg or digoxin 0,1 015mg . In addition, the triple drug combinations of hydrochlorothiazide 15 200mg plus amiloride 5 20mg plus a compound of this invention 3 200m and hydrochlorothiazide 15 200mg plus timolol 5 200mg plus a compound of this invention 3 200mg , are provided. The above dose ranges may be adjusted on a unit basis as necessary to permit divided daily dosage.Also, the dose may vary depending on the severity of the disease, weight of patient and other factors which a person skilled in the art will recognise. Certain of the compounds of formula I are assymetric and exhibit optical isomerism. Such compounds may be separated into their optical isomers using process c or.may be made by stereospecific syntheses using conventional techniques known per se. The invention therefore provides the compounds as their individual optical isomers, and racemic or other mixtures of the individual isomers. Certain of the compounds of the invention can form solvates, e.g. hydrates or alcoholates, and certain of the compounds are light sensitive and should therefore be produced, handled, stored and formulated in such a manner that they are not subjected to degrading amounts of light of the appropriate wavelengths. The invention is illustrated, but in no way limited by the following Examples in which temperatures are in degrees centigrade.Example 1 3 Methyl 5 1 methylethyl 4 2 chloro 1 cyclohexenyl 2 fluoromethyl 1,4 dihydro 6 methy1 3, 5 pyr idinedicarboxylate 2 Chlor o l cycloh exe ne l car boxalde hyde 2 . 9g, 20 mmoles , methyl 4 fluoro 3 oxobutanoate 2.7g, 20 mmoles and l methylethyl 3 amino 2 butenoate 2.88g, 20 mmoles in dried tert butanol 40ml was heated with stirring under nitrogen at 350 for 96 hours.
