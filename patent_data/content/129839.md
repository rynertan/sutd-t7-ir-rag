# Variable transformer and voltage control system.

## Abstract
A system for automatically controlling output voltage to correct for varying input voltage utilizes a transformer having a movable core structure. The output voltage from the trans former is sensed and made to conform to a predetermined standard by moving the movable core structure, which is then locked in position after its adjustment. Voltage changes are step free, and linear voltage control with respect to time is achieved through non linear movement of the core structure over a range of variation of the output voltage.
