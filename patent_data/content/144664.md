## Description
The present invention concerns a new process for preparing derivatives of the formula I The compounds of formula I can be used as intermediates in the preparation of olefinic aminoacids of formula III The transformation of the lactamic derivative of formula I into the compounds of formula III can be accomplished by hydrolyzing the lactamic derivative according to usual procedures. The starting N oxides of formula II can be prepared by oxidizing a dimethylamine derivative of formula IV The dimethylamine derivative of formula IV is in turn prepared by reaction of a cyanide of formula V The preparation of cyanides such as those of formula V are disclosed in J. Org. Chem. Decomposition reactions of N oxides of tertiary amines to give olefines and dialkylhydroxylamines are known from A.C. Cope et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., Generally this thermal decomposition is not carried out in the presence of a base. In fact the reaction mechanism proposed for this kind of decompositions involves a transition state characterized by an essentially planar quasi five membered ring adduct see Cope, the cited papers which, for what is common knowledge in the art, seems to exclude the usefulness of a base in this reaction step. Actually, the skilled man knows that it is not necessary or not useful to add a base to a system characterized by an internal reaction mechanism as the above. The base in fact could compete with the nucleophilic portion of the N oxide for the electron deficient substrate moiety, and probably change the reaction course. Surprisingly, it has been found that the decomposition reaction of an N oxide derivative of formula II in an aprotic solvent boiling over 100 C and in the presence of an inorganic base give the corresponding olefine of formula I in considerable high yields, yields that are in any case higher than in absence either of the solvent or of the base. The organic solvent is generally an aprotic solvent boiling over 100 C, for example a wax or an aromatic solvent having a boiling point higher than 100 C. Representative examples of them are dimethylformamide, xylene and toluene. Preferred solvents are dimethylformamide and xylene, while the most preferred solvent is xylene. The base is an inorganic base. Representative inorganic bases are alkali metal hydroxides or carbonates, such as potassium or sodium hydroxide, and potassium or sodium carbonate. The preferred base is potassium carbonate. The base is employed in a molar amount from 1 10 to 3 1 over the N oxide derivative of formula II. The preferred ratio base N oxide being from about 1 1 to about 1 2. The reaction temperature is between 100 C and 145 C. The preferred reaction temperature is between 110 C and 135 C. The purification of the reaction product can be carried out by using one of the variety of known purification techniques. The preferred purification procedure includes an acid washing and a distillation of the crude product of formula I. Generally, however, the compound of formula I obtained according to the process of the invention is pure enough to be submitted to the next reaction step without further purification. In fact, a further advantage of the present process is to yield the main product of formula I substantially free from the impurity represented by the amine of formula IV, which may interfere with the next reaction step or in any case need to be removed from the final product of formula III by means of further purification steps. In many instances this process gives a product wherein the amine impurity is about or less than 1 , and generally is never higher than 10 , while the usual amount of this impurity, when using different processes, is about 10 or more. The yields in the product of formula I for this reaction step are higher than 75 and in many instances are of 80 85 or more. Under the conditions of the present process no racemization of optically active compounds is observed. Therefore, starting from an optically active N oxide of formula II the corresponding olefin of formula I retaining the same optical configuration is obtained. The following examples illustrate the invention,. 5 Cyanomethyl 2 pyrrolidinone 10 9 0.08 mole are dissolved in ethanol 100 ml and 27 w v dimethylamine 0.16 mol in ethanol is added thereto. Then 5 Pd Al₂O₃ is added and the hydrogenation is carried out at a pressure of about 30 psi about 205 kPa at a temperature of about 40 C. Stirring is continued until the consume of hydrogen is ended. Then the catalyst is recovered by filtration and the filtrate is concentrated. The oily residue is distilled, recovering the fraction having boiling point 130 135 C at 1 mmHg. 5 5 Upon analysis, it is shown to be the compound of the title.
