# Process for recovering insulin.

## Abstract
Insulin can be recovered for processing and re use from an insulin protamine complex by bringing the complex into contact with an aqueous medium having a pH of from about 2 to about 5 and containing an insulin dissociating or depolymerizing agent, a cation exchanger, and a salt at a concentration of from about 0.1 M to about 0.6 M.
