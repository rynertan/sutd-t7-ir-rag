# AN ALIGNMENT AND RETENTION DEVICE FOR OPTICAL TRANSMISSION FIBERS

## Abstract
An alignment and retention device 10 for optical transmission fibers having an optical lens 44 with a forwardly directed curved surface 46 molded to a rearward extension 50 . The extension has an upper portion 52 and a lower portion 54 separated by a vee shaped gap 108 , each portion having a longitudinally extending vee shaped groove 104,106 for aligning and supporting an optical fiber 64 . The lens and rearward extension are fashioned from a single piece of plastic with an abutment means 58 compris ed of a vertical stop 60 at an interface therebetween. A focal point of the lens is located at the abutment means and a retention means 70 securely retains the optical lens while a clamping means 72 surrounds the retention means forcing the upper and lower portions together for capturing the optical fiber within the vee shaped gap providing forward an lateral fiber alignment without using an index matching adhesive.
