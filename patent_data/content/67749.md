# Closed center hydraulic servo apparatus.

## Abstract
Servo apparatus comprising a closed center valve de vice 112 which is coupled to an input member 60 to control the communication of fluid among a fluid pressure source 12, 14 , a fluid reservoir 36 , and a fluid pressure responsive device such as a vehicle brake 16 in response to movement of the input member 60 . The input member 60 and the valve device 112 are coupled through mutually engaging surfaces which cause the valve device to be shifted at a ratio with respect to movement of the input member which is greater than unity.
