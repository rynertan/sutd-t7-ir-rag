# Method and device for exhaust gas recirculation in combustion machine.

## Abstract
In a spark ignited gas engine with relatively high com pression ratio of approximately ε 12, operation takes place with relatively poor mixtures with air fuel ratios of about λ 1.6 or over in order to reduce NO At loads about approximately 70 of the normally aspirated nominal power, the oxygen ratio must be reduced in order to aspirate sufficient fuel for the power demand. NO A new venturi based mixing device 4 for the air fuel EGR is disclosed, placed upstream of the main throttle valve 2 . The system is also applicable to diesel gas, and straight diesel engines, with or without pressure charging. Due to the high compression ratio, thermal efficiency remains high.
