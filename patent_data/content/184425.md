# CLOSED DECK CYLINDER BLOCK FOR WATER COOLED INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE

## Abstract
A closed deck cylinder block of a light such as an aluminum alloy for use in a water cooled internal combus tion engine includes a cylinder defining portion 1 having a plurality of cylinder bores 3 defined therein, and a crank case defining portion 2 integral with the cylinder defining portion. The cylinder defining portion includes a water jacket 6 extending substantially the entire length of each of the cylinder bores and defined by an inner side wall 11 , and outer side wall 12 spaced therefrom, and a bottom wall 10 interconnecting the inner and outer side walls. The bottom wall has a wall thickness db substantially equal to at least one of the wall thicknesses do, di of the inner and outer side walls. The wall thicknesses of the inner and outer side walls are substantially equal to each other.
