## Description
DESCRIPTION EXPANDED PHENOLIC MATERIALS The present invention relates to improved expanded phenolic materials. Foamed or expanded thermosetting phenolic resins, when fully cured, are thermal insulators which exhibit low flammability and generate minimal smoke on forced combustion. For this reason they have been used as interlayers in various types of sandwich structures, i.e.double skinned composites with the expanded phenolic material as an interlayer, used in the building and allied industries. Expanded phenolic materials in current use, however, generally suffer from one or more of the following disadvantages i . poor mechanical and load bearing properties, ii extreme friability of surface structure, iii poor abrasion resistance, iv less than optimum thermal insulative properties when compared to polyurethanes, C a tendency to some surface spread of flame, and vi a type of auto ignition characteristic termed punking . A further disadvantage of expanded phenolic materials in current use is that the Limiting Oxygen Index toy is often in the region of 35 to 45 oxygen.The Limiting Oxygen Index is the concentration of oxygen necessary in an atmosphere to allow a sample of the expanded phenolic material, situated in that atmosphere, to be ignited. The relatively low limiting OxygenIndex values often encountered with currently available expanded phenolic materials limit their range of application in that they are not suitable for use in potentially high fire risk situations. By practice of the present invention there may be provided an expanded or foamed phenolic material having considerably improved mechanical properties, enaanced fire resistance, a significant increase in the LimitingOxygen Index value, and which is not subject to punking or surface friability. According to the present invention there is provided an expanded or foamed phenolic material formed by reacting a mixture comprising a phenolic resin and an epoxy resit in the presence of a foaming or blowing agent, a catalyst, a reinforcing material and at least one filler material. The phenolic resin used in producing the expanded phenolic material of the present invention can, for example, be a liquid phenolic resin or a solution of a phenolic resin, e.g., a solid phenolic resin, in a suitable solvents The phenolic resin used may, for examples be in the Bn stage and curable to form a fully crosslinked, insoluble C stage material. An example of a suitable phenolic resin for use in preparing the expanded phenolic material of the present invention is a phenolic resin of the rest type.Preferably, the resol type resin is prepared by condensing a phenol, e.g., phenol, with formaldehyde paraferm aldehyde or like material. For example, 1 mole f the phenol may be condensed with 1 to 3 moles of formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde or like material, The phenolic resin used in forming the expande phenolic material of the present invention may have a viscosity of, for example, approximately 20 poises at ambient temperature.The phenolic resin may, for example, also have a solids content of approximately 76 and or a specific gravity of approximately 1.3 and or a hot plate cure time of approximately 65 seconds. Suitable phenolic resins for use in the present invention include SMD 3083 a product of SchenectadyMidland Limited , Lankro BK2 a product of LankroLimited , and mixtures thereof, for example, a 50 50 mixture. The epoxy resin used in forming the expanded pilenolic material of the present invention should preferably b a liquid epoxy resin, for example, a liquid bifunctional epoxy resin. She epoxy resin may, for example, be obtained by condensing ep ichlorohydrin with po lyhydroxy compounds such as Bispnenol A. For example, the epoxy resin may be obtained by reacting 1 mole of Bisphenol A with 2 moles of epichlorohydrin. Suitable epoxy resins include CY 219 a product of Ciba Geigy Limited andEpikote 828 a product of Shell Chemicals . Ireferably, the epoxy resin is used in an amount of from 3 to 20 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the phenolic resins The epoxy resin is a thermosetting resin which copolymerises with the phenolic resin to yield a copolymer exhibiting enhanced toughness and resistance to friability over the normal expanded phenolic resin.Also, the phenolic resin epoxy resin copolymer appears to bond to metal and other substrates better than the phenolic resin alone. The epoxy resin does not contribute to the extremely low flammability properties of the fully cured copolymer in any negative way. However, it may lead to a very small increase in smoke generation upon forced combustion. The foaming or blowing agent used in forming the expanded phenolic material of the present invention may, for example, be a low boiling point organic liquid, e.g., of the type used as refrigerants. Suitable foaming or blowing agents include hydrocarbons or halohydrocarbons such as Freonn a trade name of I.C.I. limited , preferably Freon 11. Ereferably, the foaming or blowing agent is used in an amount of from 5 to 20 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the phenolic resin. The catalyst used in producing the expanded phenolic material of the present invention may, for example, be an organic or inorganic acid catalyst. Suitable organic acids include para toluene sulphonic acid, which may be obtained from Tnkro Limited under the name Phencat 38 , and para cresol sulphonic acid. Suitable inorganic acids include phosphoric acid and mineral acids such as sulphuric acid and hydrochloric acid. Adducts or derivatives of the inorganic or organic acids may alternatively be used so long as they have the required pH lowering effect. If mineral acids are utilized as the catalyst, then they should preferably be sufficiently diluted in order that the safety and corrosion problems associated with the use of concentrated mineral acids are avoided or substantially reduced. Because of.the potential safety and corrosion problems associated with the use of mineral acids, the organic or weak inorganic acids are preferred for use as the catalyst. The catalyst is preferably utilized in an amount of from 5 to 35 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the phenolic resin. Suitable materials for use as the reinforcing material include fibrous materials, such as glass fibre and carbon fibre. Glass fibres are preferably used in the form of chopped glass fibres, e.g., of approximately 6 mm and or approximately 12mm length. Thermally conductive materials, e.g, metallic materials, and or combustible materials are undesirable for use as the reinforcing material since their presence in the expanded phenolic material would adversely affect its thermal insulation property and or low flammaility, respectively. Preferably, the reinforcing material is present, in the expanded phenolic material of the present invention, in an amount of from 3 to 20 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the phenolic resin. Suitable filler materials for use in the present invention include water scavengers and non combustible hollow microspheres, for example, hollow ceramic micro spheres. The term nwater scavenger , as used herein, refers to a material that will absorb water but will remain in a relatively dry condition, for example, Plaster ofParis 2CaSO4.H2O or silica gel. Deliquescent materials, such as calcium chloride, are not intended to be included within the scope of the term water scavenger since they absorb so much water that they eventually dissolve in it and are, therefore, unsatisfactory for use in the expanded phenolic materials of the present invention. The .water scavenger if present, serves to remove water produced during the curing of the phenolic and epoxy resins and then, in its more highly hydrated form, acts as a filler. For example, Plaster of Paris 2CaSO4.H2O is converted to gypsum CaSO4.2H2O on absorb watery The removal of free water is consider to be advantageous for the in situ foaming of the phenolic resin epoxy resin copolymer in that it also contributes to improved bonding to substrates The water scavenger, when present is preferably used ia an amount of from 20 to 80 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the phenolic resin. The non combustible microspheres, when incorporated into the expanded phenolic material of the present invention, yield a syntactic foam within the chemically expanded cellular structure. Thus, there will be two modes of producing a foam within the same copolymer.The net result of such a syntactic expanded foam structure is the enhancement of the thermal insulation characteristics of the fully cured system and an appreciable lowering of overall weight. Preferably, the non combustible, hollow microspheres are in the form of hollow ceramic microspheres which are very resistant to fire due to their ceramic nature. The non combustible, hollow microspheres, when present, are preferably used in an amount of from 5 to 100 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the phenolic resin. In addition to reacting the mixture comprising the phenolic resin and the epoxy resin in the presence of the foaming or blowing agent, catalyst, reinforcing material and at least one filler, a surfactant, for example Tween 80 a product of Atlas Chemicals Limited may also be present. When present, the surfactant is preferably used in an amount of up to 5 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the phenolic resin. he surfactant can be used to control the size and regularity of the cells forming the expanded phenolic material of the present invention. The expanded phenolic materials of the present invention are produced by reacting the mixture comprising the phenolic resin and the epoxy resin in the presence of the catalyst, foaming or blowing agent, the reinforcing material, the at least one filler and, optionally, the surfactant. The expanded phenolic materials of the present invention are preferably produced by mixing together the phenolic resin, the epoxy resin and, if present, the surfactant. Any suitable stirrer system may be utilised to effect this mixing, such as a Hobart mixer. The mixture obtained is then compounded with the foaming or blowing agent. The Filler material, for example a mixture of Plaster of Paris and hollow ceramic microspheres, is subsequently admixed with the resin mixture and the catalyst added.. At this stage, a period of 3 to 4 minutes is normally available before the chemical reaction commences. The glass fibre is added as a final step and the whole stirred until homogeneous. Just prior to the commencement of the chemical curing reaction, and the foaming or blowing agentinduced expansion, the fully mixed formulation is placed, e.g., pumped or poured, into the final containment vessel or hollow space. Generally within 10 to 30 minutes the system fully expands, for example from 0.5 to 3 0 expansion ratios, and cures and hardens. he reaction is preferably allowed to take place at ambient temperature.
