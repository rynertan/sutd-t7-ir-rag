# Apparatus for the continuous measurement of bulk density material such as cut tobacco.

## Abstract
An apparatus is provided for the continuous measurement of the bulk density of particulate material comprising an endless belt weighing conveyor 11 having a compression zone and a weigh span downstream of the compression zone, means 10 for feeding the material to said compression zone, a compression unit 12 at said compression zone having a series of rollers 33 on axes extending transverse to the direction of movement of the weighing conveyor, and transducer means 63 provided at the weigh span for producing signals proportion to material weight. The rollers 33 may be driven with a surface speed equal to the weighing conveyor belt speed and additional rollers 61 may be mounted below the weighing conveyor to carry the load. The rollers 33 are preferably embraced by a belt 34 which gives a continuous surface and prevents tobacco getting bet ween the rollers. In which case, the belt is driven with the same speed as the weighing conveyor belt, via a terminal roller 32 and the other rollers follow.
