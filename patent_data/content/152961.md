# Position detecting apparatus.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a position detecting apparatus which has a position detecting section 10, 20 having elongated magnetic bodies 11a 11e, 21a 21e and a plurality of exciting lines 12a 12i, 22a 22i and a plurality of detecting lines 13a 13h, 23a 23h which are arranged alternatingly such as to cross the magnetic bodies orthogonally thereto. A driving power source 30 is adapted to apply A.C. voltage of a predetermined fre quency to the exciting lines. A position appointing magnetism generator 50 applies a local magnetic bias to the magnetic bodies. The position appointed by the position appointing mag netism generator is detected through the detection of the voltages induced in the detecting lines. According to this arrangement, the position appointing magnetism generator can be handled easily because it is not connected to any stationary part of the apparatus, and the position can be detected at a high precision without being affected by external induction and noises and without producing noise which would affect nearby devices.
