# A coupling mechanism.

## Abstract
A coupling system includes a connecting assembly 4 having two upwardly facing critically angled U shaped lifting forks mounted at the upper ends of its sides. A bucket 2 has two transversely spaced locating members 6 and 8 defining a central profiled portion 10. Two co linear transverse pins 12 are mounted at the top of the portion 10, and a central recess 18 is formed in the profiled portion 10. An end member 22 having an aperture 24 therein is located at the base of the recess 18. A latch bar 34 and an operating cylinder 36 are mounted on the assembly 4, and are dimensioned to fit in the recess 15. In operation, the assembly 4 is tilted forwardly and advanced until the lifting pins 12 enter the forks 32. The assembly 4 is then tilted backwards and edged forwardly until the cylinder 36 and the latch bar 34 enter the recess 18. The cylinder 36 is then operated to advance the latch bar 34 into the aperture 24 to couple together the bucket 2 and the assembly 4. To detach the bucket 2 the cylinder 36 is operated to retract the latch bar 34 from the aperture 24. The assembly 4 is tilted until the lower face of the bucket 2 swings out parallel to the ground, and the bucket 2 is then lowered until it rests on the ground. The assembly 4 is tilted forwardly and is reversed to withdraw the forks 32 from the pins 12.
