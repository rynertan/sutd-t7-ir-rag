# Fast acting spark over detector.

## Abstract
A spark over detector for an electrostatic precipitator has a current sensor 2 which provides a signal a which is differentiated twice to produce a signal c . If the level of the signal c is above a predetermined level then a level detecting circuit 7 passes a signal d to an AND gate 8 . A second level detecting circuit 9 receives the signal a and if this signal is above a predetermined level passes the signal e to a timing circuit 10 which provides a signal f from a first preset time after having received the signal e until a second preset time after the signal e has ceased. Thus, if a spark over starts to occur signals d and f occur simul taneously and the AND gate produces an output signal g which can be used to trigger the thyristor switch circuit T of the pulse generator to conduction to prevent thyristor damage or destruction.
