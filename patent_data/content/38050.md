# Electrophotographic color proofing apparatus.

## Abstract
An electrophotographic color proofing apparatus in cluding a copyboard carrying a color separated positive and capable of being positioned into intimate contact with a charged photoconductive coating of an electro photographic member. The engaged members are ex posed to light, discharging the coating in increments to form a latent electrostatic image thereon. The copy board is withdrawn and the exposed electrophotographic member rotated 180 degrees facing toward a toning assembly consisting of a row of plural toning units, each carrying a different color toner and arranged in line for linear translation below the exposed electrophotographic member with a selected one toning unit thereof being activated to apply a selected color toner to the latent electrostatic image. The toned member again is revolved 180 degrees. A pre wet transfer medium in the form of print paper stock is engaged with the toned member for transfer of the toned image, preferably by drawing a roller across said member while employing a simulta neous electric bias. A full color proof can be obtained by repeating the cycle, activating successive individual toning units of the assembly and using the same sheet of transfer medium. Registry of plural images applied to a single sheet is effected mechanically, as by upstanding pins provided on the support for electrophotographic members and or the copyboard. Provision is made to clean both the photoconductive surface and the bias plates of the toning units of excess and or residual toner.
