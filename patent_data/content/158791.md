## Description
AN IMPROVED CONTROL ROD ASSEMBLY FOR A NUCLEAR REACTOR FUEL ASSEMBLY The invention relates generally to nuclear reactors and, more particularly, to a rod assembly for use with a nuclear fuel assembly. In most nuclear reactors, the core portion of the reactor comprises a large number of elongate fuel rods grouped and supported in frameworks called fuel assemblies which receive support and alignment from upper and lower transversely extending core support plates. In conventional fuel assemblies, fuel rods and control rod guide thimbles are held in an organized array by means of grids spaced apart along the fuel assembly and attached to the guide thimbles. Top and bottom nozzles at opposite ends of the fuel assembly are secured to the guide thimbles.Generally, in most reactors, a liquid coolant, such as water, is directed upward through apertures in the lower core support plate and along the various fuel assemblies to receive thermal energy therefrom. One method of controlling the reactivity within a reactor core is by moving neutron absorbing elements, commonly referred to as control rods, into and out of the core region. One arrangement utilizing control rods in association with a fuel assembly is disclosed in U.S.Patent Specification No. 4,326,919 showing a fixed array of control rods supported at their upper ends by a spider assembly which, in turn, is connected to a control rod drive mechanism operable to raise and lower referred to as a stepping action the control rods in their guide thimbles. The typical construction of a control rod used in such an arrangement is in the form of an elongate metallic tube or cladding containing a neutron absorbing material and having its opposite ends sealed with end plugs.Usually, the neutron absorbing material is in the form of closely packed ceramic pellets stacked within the cladding tube through part of its length so as to leave a space between the stack of pellets and the upper end plug. This space serves as a plenum chamber for receiving gases generated during operation. In order to hold the stack of pellets firmly packed together, the stack is usually spring loaded by means of a pressure or coil spring disposed in the plenum chamber and bearing directly against the uppermost pellet of the stack. This creates upon the pellet a high stress contact area which may cause the pellet to crumble, thereby destroying its usefulness and consequently degrading the effectiveness of the control rod, a condition especially prevalent during so called scram operations subjecting the control rods to considerable shock.Furthermore, in order to prevent rupture of the cladding due to internal pressure build up of the gases, the design volume of the plenum chamber must be sufficient to accommodate the gases without exceeding a predetermined safe pressure level. However, finding the right design volume requires that a determination first be made as to exactly what pressure levels the generated gases will attain under all operating conditions, a task which is extremely difficult to achieve due to the many different absorber materials and hybrid combinations thereof used.The same problems as mentioned above in conjunction with control rods may be encountered also with nuclear fuel rods which are of similar construction except that their neutron reactive pellets consist of nuclear fuel instead of a neutron absorbing material. The invention has for its principal object to provide an improved rod assembly which does not pose the above mentioned problems. The invention accordingly resides in a rod assembly for use in a nuclear reactor, comprising a tubular cladding member having end plugs which seal the tubular cladding member at the opposite ends thereof, and, disposed within the cladding member, a stack of neutron reactive pellets supported, at one end of the stack, by one of the end plugs, and a pressure spring biassing the stack of pellets against said one end plug so as to maintain the integrity of the stack, characterized in that said tubular cladding member further contains means forming a spring seat which is positioned between the opposite end of said stack of pellets and the other of said end plugs in spaced relationship therewith, the space between the stack of pellets and the spring seat forming means defining a plenum chamber, and the space between the spring seat forming means and said other end plug defining an auxiliary chamber in gas flow communication with said plenum chamber and a slidable spring load distributing member disposed within said plenum chamber in abutment with said opposite end of the stack of pellets said pressure spring being held under compression between said spring seat forming means and said spring load distributing member, and the spring load distributing member being adapted to permit gases evolved from said stack of pellets to pass into said plenum chamber. With the above arrangement employing a spring load distributing member between the pressure spring and the stack of pellets, the spring force is evenly distributed over the surface of the end pellet in the stack and, consequently, there is no high stress contact area causing the pellet to crumble. Moreover, the addition of an auxiliary chamber in gas flow communication with the plenum chamber substantially increases the amount of gas which can be accommodated without the risk of rupture of the cladding tube. Preferably, the tubular cladding member has disposed therein a tubular insert which extends in reinforcing relationship with respect to the adjacent side walls of the cladding member from said other end plug for at least the length of the auxiliary chamber.The spring seat forming means as well as the spring load distributing member may be a disc like member with a gas flow passage therethrough, such disc like configuration being conducive to keeping the ends of the pressure spring in their proper shape and positions. A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is an elevational and partly cross sectional view showing a fuel assembly in vertically foreshortened form and with parts thereof broken away for clarity and Figure 2 is an enlarged, vertically sectional view of a control rod embodying the invention. In the following description, like reference numerals will be used to designate like or corresponding parts in both views, and terms such as 1,forward , rearward , left , right , upwardly , downwardly , and the like, are employed as words of convenience not to be construed as limiting terms. Referring now to the drawings, and particularly to Figure 1, there is shown an overall combination interface of a fuel assembly generally designated with numeral 10, an upper core support plate 12 disposed above and extending across the fuel assembly 10, and a spider assembly 14 supporting a fixed array of control rods, only one of which is shown at 15. The fuel assembly 10 basically comprises a lower end structure or bottom nozzle 16 for supporting the assembly on a lower core plate not shown in the core region of a reactor not shown a number of elongate guide tubes or thimbles 18 projecting longitudinally upward from the bottom nozzle 16 a plurality of transverse grids 20 axially spaced apart along the guide thimbles 18 an organized array of elongate fuel rods 22 transversely spaced apart and supported by the grids 20 an instrumentation tube 24 located in the center of the assembly and an upper end structure or top nozzle 26 attached to the upper ends of the guide thimbles 18 to form an integral assembly capable of being conventionally handled without damaging the assembly components.Since the fuel assembly 10 generally does not form part of the invention and is shown herein only for the purpose of illustration, it need not be described herein in further detail. The upper core support plate 12 extends across the top of the shown fuel assembly 10 and also across the tops of the other fuel assemblies not shown arranged within the core. Since the support plate 12 is conventional, suffice it to say that it has a multiplicity of flow openings, such as flow passages 28, which allow coolant to pass upwardly through the core, and that at least some of these passages are axially aligned with the guide thimbles 18 to enable control rods 15 to be inserted into the guide thimbles 18 of fuel assembly 10 through the respective passages 28 in the plate 12. The spider assembly 14 has the upper ends of the control rods 15 connected thereto, and it supports the control rods for vertical movement within the guide thimbles 18 effected by means of a conventional drive mechanism not shown . The spider assembly 14 itself likewise forms no part of the invention per se, wherefore it will not be further described herein. It should be noted, however, that the spider assembly, although shown herein as disposed above the core plate 12 upon which it will rest when the control rods 15 are fully inserted in the guide thimbles 18, in some known arrangements is located between the bottom of the core plate and the top of the fuel assembly. The control rod assembly 15 embodying the invention, now to be described in detail with particular reference to Figure 2, includes an elongate, relatively thin walled, metallic cladding or tube 30 having its opposite ends sealed by means of end plugs 32 and 34. The upper end plug 32 has formed integral therewith an upwardly extending stem section with an externally threaded end portion 36 for threaded connection of the control rod assembly to the spider assembly 14. The lower end plug 34 is cone shaped. Slidably disposed within tube 30 and resting upon the lower end plug 34 is a stack of neutron absorbing pellets 38 made of a suitable material having a high neutron absorption cross section, such as boron carbide, tantalum, a combination of silver idium and cadmium, or one of many other commonly known materials. Resting upon the upper surface of the uppermost pellet 38, and slidable within the tube 30, is a load distributing spacer 40, preferably in the form of a disc, which has an axial bore 42 extending therethrough. Axially spaced above the disc like spacer 40, and slidable within the tube 30 is a similar load distributing spacer 44 which likewise is preferably in the form of a disc and has an axial bore 46 therethrough.A coil spring 48 is interposed under compression between the spacers 40 and 44 to maintain the axially spaced relationship between the spacers in which the latter define therebetween a plenum chamber 50 for receiving the gases generated by the pellets 38 as they absorb neutrons in performing their intended function. In the preferred embodiment, means in the form of a tubular insert 52 is interposed between and in abutment with the upper end plug 32 and the upper spacer 44. The tubular insert 52 defines an auxiliary chamber 54 and, being relatively rigid, reinforces the upper end portion of tube 30 against collapse due to implosion caused by external pressure. Moreover, the tubular insert 52 is of sufficient axial length to hold the spacer 44 in its proper spaced relationship with respect to the spacer 40 which maintains the coil spring 48 under compression. From the above, it will be appreciaTed that wises generated by the neutron absorbing pellets 38 will flow into the plenum chamber 50 through the axial bore 42 of the spacer 40, and the gas expanding in the plenum chamber 50 will pass therefrom into the auxiliary chamber 54 through the axial bore 46 of the spacer 44. Thus, there is ample space for the gas to occupy, and consequently it is unlikely that the gas pressure within the control rod will ever reach a critical level threatening rupture. Furthermore, the spacers 40 and 44 serve to distribute the force of the spring 48 so that there are no high contact stresses tending to damage the pellets 38. It will be appreciated that the invention particularly described herein in conjunction with a control rod can be similarly applied also to nuclear fuel rods.
