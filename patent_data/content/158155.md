## Description
The present invention relates to a picture information signal processing apparatus and, more particularly, to a picture information signal processing apparatus which is used for displaying, with high quality, a picture information signal read by an image sensor from a document. With display devices such as liquid crystal displays, and thermal printers, a bi level picture can be displayed very stably. Where a general picture which includes a continuous tone picture is displayed by these display devices, a continuous tone picture display system using a dithering technique is conventionally used. According to this dithering technique, during a process wherein the continuous tone picture information is quantized into bi level information, a threshold value used for bi level quantization is varied in accordance with a random or pseudo random function. However, when a picture is displayed with a number of gradations, not only does the resolution decrease but irregular noise is liable to be produced. An apparatus is known which is arranged to input a picture using a color image sensor equipped with spatially divided color filters and output an output signal from the color image sensor to a color printer to reproduce the picture. When a printed document including characters and a color picture is copied by such apparatus, dots forming a continuous tone picture are displayed as noises, with a result that colors of the picture in the printed document are not reproduced precisely. An improved picture information processing system is disclosed in a copending European Patent Application No. 83111844.3 filed November 25, 1983 published under nr. EP A 0110353 on 13.06.1984 entitled Picture Signal Processing System Suitable For Displaying Continuous Tone Pictures and assigned to the same assignee as this application. According to one of the methods which are disclosed in this application, the rate of variation in local density of an input picture is detected. When the rate of variation in local density is greater than a specified value, a picture information processing circuit quantizes an input picture information signal into a bi level information signal on the basis of a fixed threshold value. On the other hand, when the rate of variation in local density is smaller than the specified value, the circuit dithers the input picture information signal. According to another method disclosed in the application, in order to display a continuous tone color picture which is formed of dots, a brightness signal and color picture information signals are averaged. By averaging the picture information signals, dot noises are eliminated. The rate of variation in the local density of the input picture is detected on the basis of the brightness signal which has the dot noises eliminated therefrom. When this rate of variation is greater than a specified value, the picture information signals are subjected to bi level quantization on the basis of a fixed threshold value. On the other hand, when the rate of variation is smaller than the specified value, the picture information signals are dithered. According to the first method, the dot picture is displayed on a bi level basis and difficulties are encountered in displaying the continuous tone picture. In the second method as well, a problem occurs in reproducing the dot picture. An object of the present invention is to provide an improved picture information signal processing apparatus for use in displaying continuous tone pictures. Another object of the present invention is to provide a picture information signal processing apparatus for processing a picture information signal in a different manner according to a dot picture, a character picture and a continuous tone picture to properly display the picture. The picture information signal processing apparatus of the present invention is used in a picture display system including a picture information input means for obtaining, by optically scanning an input picture, a picture information signal indicating the input picture, and a picture information output means for displaying an output picture corresponding to the input picture in response to the picture information signal. To process the picture information signal so as to pleasantly display the output picture, according to this invention, the picture information signal processing apparatus comprises picture type discriminating means for discriminating the type of an input picture on the basis of the distribution of picture characteristic signals derived from picture information signals each indicative of a pixel of the input picture, in a pixel array having a specified size, and means responsive to the picture type discriminating means for selecting one of the bi level quantization techniques for picture information signal which is applied to the picture information output means in accordance with the type of the input picture. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the picture characteristic signal is the bi level signal of a Laplacian signal of the picture information signal corresponding to a pixel of the input picture. The Laplacian signal indicates the difference between the picture information signal corresponding to one pixel and a signal prepared by averaging the picture information signals corresponding to the pixel array. The methods of bi level quantization which is used in the picture processing of the present invention includes a method of simple bi level quantization based on a fixed threshold value and a method of dithering based on variable threshold values. According to the present invention, the input picture includes a first type of character line pictures, a second type of dot pictures, and a third type of variable density pictures. The bi level quantization selecting means selects, in response to the picture type discriminating means, the simple bi level quantization of picture information signal for the character line pictures of the first type and the dithering of the picture information signal for the other types of pictures. The bi level quantization selecting means receives a picture information signal having its high frequency components intensified and bi level quantized when the picture information signal has been decided by the picture type discriminating means to be of the first type. It receives an averaged picture information signal and dithers it when the picture information signal has been decided by the picture type discriminating means to be of the second type i.e., dot picture. It receives a picture information signal as it is and dithers it when the picture information signal has been decided by the picture type discriminating means to be of the third type i.e., variable density picture. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which A picture information processing apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention, as shown in Fig. 1, is arranged to suitably process a picture information signal to be applied to a picture display device by descriminating the characteristic of picture within a local area of a document, in accordance with distribution of rates of variation of the picture information signal, corresponding to that local area of the document, read by means of an image sensor. The picture information processing apparatus of this embodiment uses a scanning type proximity sensor as its picture input section, and a thermal printer as its picture displaying output section. Referring now to Fig. 1, a proximity sensor 11 reads an input document 2 carrying a color picture thereon, while scanning the document 2 in a direction indicated by an arrow, to produce a picture information signal. In the proximity sensor 11, a linear light source 1 irradiates the document 2 and light reflected therefrom is focused on a linear CCD image sensor 4 having CCD chips through a self focusing rod lens array 3 which is known under the trade name of SELFOC . On each sensor element of the image sensor 4 one of the color filters for red R , green G and blue B components is provided whereby electric signals of R, G and B components for one pixel are obtained. The picture information signal contains signals indicating the R, G and B components for each pixel, which are serially read out from the image sensor 4 for each pixel. In this embodiment, one pixel has a length of 84 µm and, within this one pixel, three sensor elements are contained. The picture information signal which has been read out from the image sensor 4 is amplified in an amplifier 5 and then is converted, by an analog to digital A D converter 6, into a digital signal of 8 bits. This digital signal is applied to a normalizing circuit 7, which is intended to compensate for variation in sensitivity of the CCD sensor elements of the image sensor 4 and variation in optical characteristics of the color filters, eliminate fixed noise in the CCD, and compensate for variation in the amount of light emanated from the light source and unwanted distribution of the amount of light. The signal thus normalized is applied to a matrix circuit 8 to be converted from R, G and B signals into a brightness signal I and color difference signals C1 and C2. These signals are applied to a picture quality improving circuit 10 as described later which constitutes a main part of the picture information processing apparatus. The picture quality improving circuit 10 is arranged to decide the type of the input picture and properly processes the brightness signal I and color difference signals C1 and C2 in accordance with the input document. After having been processed in this way, the brightness signal I and color difference signals C1 and C2 are applied to a color conversion circuit 12. The signal processing system prior to the color conversion circuit 12 handles the additive primaries of R, G and B. The color conversion circuit 12 converts these additive primary signals into subtractive primary signals of magenta M , cyan C and yellow Y suitable for the subsequent print in a color printer 16. The M, C, Y color signals which have been output from the color conversion circuit 12 are applied to a binarization dithering selecting circuit 14, in which they are binarized or dithered in accordance with a decision made by the picture quality improving circuit 10 on the input picture continuous tone picture, line picture such as character, or dot picture . Thereafter, they are applied to the color printer 16, which displays a pleasant color output picture corresponding to the color input picture by virtue of the picture quality improving circuit 10 and the binary encoding dithering selecting circuit 14. The picture quality improving circuit 10 will now be described in detail. It includes, as shown in Fig. 2, a picture quality improving circuit 19a for processing the brightness signal I, and picture quality improving circuits 19b and 19c for processing the first and second color difference signals C1 and C2, respectively. The brightness signal and first and second color difference signals which have respectively been processed by those picture quality improving circuits are denoted by The brightness signal picture quality improving circuit 19a is shown in Fig. 3. This circuit includes a Laplacian calculating circuit hereinafter, referred to as a first circuit 20, which receives the brightness signal I and calculates its Laplacian with respect to each pixel to produce a Laplacian signal. The Laplacian signal output from the first circuit 20 is applied to a second circuit 30. In this second circuit 30, the Laplacian signal is binary encoded on the basis of a fixed threshold value. Further, in this circuit 30, a pattern of the binary Laplacian signals corresponding to a pixel array of a specified size is compared with predetermined patterns of binary Laplacian signals in a pixel array of the same size. These patterns are previously prepared in the circuit 30 in accordance with the characteristics of various pictures. The result of comparison is represented in the form of a two bit configuration. The type of input picture is roughly decided by way of this pattern comparison. The Laplacian signal from the first circuit 20 is also applied to a third circuit 40, which codes an absolute value of the Laplacian signal into a four bit signal and adds together these coded signals corresponding to a specified number of pixels. The third circuit 40 is intended to examine the significance of the rough decision made by the second circuit 30 in accordance with the magnitude of the Laplacian signal. Therefore, for example, even when the second circuit 30 decides an input document by noise in this case, the Laplacian signal is relatively small resulting from stains on the input document, the third circuit 40 can inform the picture information processing circuit of the fact that the decision made by the second circuit 30 is based on noise. The output of the third circuit 40 consists of upper four bits of the result of addition. The outputs of the second and third circuits 30 and 40 are coupled to a fourth circuit 50 which is arranged to integrally decide the type of the input picture. The fourth circuit 50 decides whether the input picture is a continuous tone picture, a line picture, or a dot picture. In order that the circuit 50 may precisely decide on a portion of the input document, the result of a preceding decision on another portion of the input document near that portion being decided is fed from a fifth circuit 60 back to the fourth circuit 50. That is, output signals of the second, third and fifth circuits are utilized as picture type decision input signals of the fourth circuit 50. The output signal J of the picture type decision circuit 50 is composed of two bits, the most significant bit of which is applied to the fifth circuit 60. The output signal of the fifth circuit 60 is composed of four bits. The two bit output signal J of the picture type decision circuit 50 is applied to a sixth circuit 70 for processing the picture information signal. The picture information signal processing circuit 70 receives the brightness signal I to compensate for its high frequency components and average the brightness signal I with respect to a specified number of pixels. Further, the circuit 70 is responsive to the output signal J of the picture type decision circuit 50 to selectively output the high frequency compensated signal, the averaged signal, or the brightness signal. In more detail, the Laplacian calculating circuit 20 includes a delay circuit 21 for delaying the input brightness signal I, a low pass filter LPF 23 for passing only low frequency components of the input brightness signal I, and a subtractor 25 for calculating the difference Laplacian between the output signals of the delay circuit 21 and LPF 23. The calculation of Laplacian in accordance with this embodiment corresponds to a process of extracting the high frequency components from the input signal. It is well known that both of them are qualitatively in coincidence with each other. LPF 23 may actually be arranged to average the picture information signal with respect to a specified number of pixels, e.g., 3 x 3 pixels. Constructing LPF 23 in a digital manner is easy. The output signal of the subtractor 25 is applied, as a Laplacian signal, to the second and third circuits 30 and 40. The algorithm of the Laplacian operation used in this embodiment is such that, as shown in Fig. 4, the difference between the value of a center pixel i22 in the array Of 3 x 3 pixels and a mean value of pixels iℓm ℓ , m 1, 2, and 3 including i22 is calculated to obtain the Laplacian of the pixel i22. More specifically, the LPF 23 may comprise an adder circuit for adding together values of corresponding consecutive three pixels iℓm on three consecutive scanning lines, and a multiplier circuit which can be inexpensively constructed using ROM for reducing an output value of the adder circuit to 1 9. The subtractor 25 calculates the difference between the value of the pixel i22 and a mean value of the 3 x 3 pixels iℓm to thereby obtain a Laplacian of the pixel i22. In this way, the Laplacian of each pixel is obtained. The Laplacian signal is composed of 8 bits including one sign bit. The eight bit Laplacian signal from the first circuit 20 is binary encoded, in the second circuit 30, into 1 or 0 on the basis of a fixed threshold value by a binary encoder 31, which can be constructed of ROM. The binary Laplacian signal from the binary encoder 31, which corresponds to each pixel, is sequentially stored, for each scanning line, in line memories 32, 33, and 34 through a multiplexer 35. Three bits are read out from each of the line memories 32, 33 and 34 and a resultant nine bit signal is applied to a ROM 36 as an address signal. The ROM 36 previously stores code information, which identifies the types of input pictures, resulting from distributions of binary Laplacian signals in the 3 x 3 pixel array which are examined beforehand with respect to continuous tone pictures, line pictures and dot pictures. For this reason, the ROM 36 is accessed by an address signal from the line memories 32, 33 and 34, which indicates the distribution of binary Laplacian signals, to thereby provide a two bit code information signal indicating the type of corresponding picture. As stated before, the object of second circuit 30 resides in the rough decision of the type of picture or the document. The consideration on which the picture information processing of the present invention is based will now be described. Fig. 5A shows a brightness signal which is obtained by one dimensional scanning of a dot picture by the proximity sensor 11 while, on the other hand, Fig. 5B shows a brightness signal which is obtained by one dimensional scanning of a character picture by the sensor 11. As seen in Figs. 5A and 5B, in the dot picture and character picture, great local variation occurs in the amplitude of the brightness signal which indicates the density of the picture. For this reason, it is difficult to discriminate between the dot and character pictures on the basis of such local variation in amplitude of the Laplacian signals. Fig. 5C shows a brightness signal which is obtained by one dimensional scanning of a variable density picture such as a photograph. In this case, as can be seen, the Laplacian signal is small. Therefore, such a variable density picture can be sufficiently discriminated from the dot picture and character picture on the basis of the magnitude of the Laplacian signals. In order to discriminate between the dot picture and the character picture, it is sufficient to examine the distribution of binary Laplacian signals corresponding to pixels in a specified pixel array. Examination was made of the distribution of binary Laplacian signals with respect to each of a character picture and dot picture, the results were obtained as shown in Figs. 6A and 6B. In the Figures, the abscissa represents the arrangement of binary Laplacian signals in the array of 3 x 3 pixels and the ordinate represents the frequency with which the arrangement of binary Laplacian signals occurs. The arrangement of binary Laplacian signals consists of a 9 bit data whose MSB and LSB correspond to i11 and i33 in the 3 x 3 pixel array shown in Fig. 4, respectively. For example, where only the binary Laplacian signal corresponding to the pixel i11 is 1, the 9 bit data is given by 100000000 . At the left end of the abscissa, all binary Laplacian signals for the 3 x 3 pixel array are 0 and, at the right end thereof, all binary Laplacian signals are 1. As seen from the result shown in Fig. 6A, in case of character pictures, such patterns of binary Laplacian signals as shown in Figs. 7A, 7B and 7C appear with a higher frequency. In this case, there is a tendency that not only white pixels but also black pixels are arranged side by side to some extent. This tendency coincides with the qualitative tendency of a character pattern. On the other hand, the result shown in Fig. 6B is obtained with respect to dot pictures. As seen, such patterns of binary Laplacian signals as shown in Figs. 8A, 8B and 8C appear with a higher frequency. This indicates the qualitative tendency of dot pictures that neither white pixels nor black pixels are continuously arranged but they have a periodic pattern. In Figs. 7 and 8, portions where oblique lines are drawn each represent the binary Laplacian signal of 1 and portions where no lines are drawn each represent the binary Laplacian signal of 0 . Accordingly, the discrimination of the type of input pictures becomes possible by examining the magnitude of Laplacian signals and the distribution of binary Laplacian signals. For this reason, in the second circuit 30, the Laplacian signals are binary encoded and the address signal indicating the distribution of binary Laplacian signals in the 3 x 3 pixel array is applied to the ROM 36. In accordance with data shown in Figs. 6A and 6B, ROM 36 stores code information adapted for discriminating the type of input pictures, in its storage location accessed by an address signal indicating an arrangement of binary Laplacian signals. In order to discriminate three types of pictures, i.e., dot picture, line picture, and continuous tone picture, ROM 36 stores code information composed of two bits for example, 00, 01, or 11 . For simplification, only the sign bit of Laplacian signal may be handled in place of binary encoding the Laplacian signal. The Laplacian signal is also applied to the third circuit 40, in which the Laplacian signal is converted into an absolute value and also is subjected to non linear conversion. ROM 41 converts the Laplacian signal, in a non linear manner, into a 4 bit signal for the convenience of the subsequent additive operation, whereby Laplacian signals having opposite signs and an equal magnitude are converted into the same digital information of 4 bits. The 4 bit information from the ROM 41 is applied to a latch circuit 43 through a delay circuit 42 arranged to provide a time delay corresponding to the time delay caused by the second circuit 30. The latch circuit 43 stores information signals corresponding to three pixels. The three pixel information signals are added together by adders 44 and 45. The most significant 4 bits of the 5 bit sum is applied to the picture type decision circuit 50. The third circuit 40 examines the magnitude of Laplacian signals to cooperate the fourth circuit 50 for deciding the type of input pictures. Through a simple picture type decision by the second circuit 30 based on the comparison between distribution patterns of binary Laplacian signals, stains or the like of the input document can be determined to be one of dot picture, continuous tone picture, and line picture. In case of stains, the Laplacian signals are relatively small. For this reason, through examining the magnitude of the Laplacian signals, the picture type decision circuit 50 is prevented from making an erroneous decision such as stains being one of the above mentioned three types of pictures, so a more precise decision of the picture type becomes possible. The picture type decision circuit 50 is formed of a ROM. Following address input signals are applied to the ROM as shown in Fig. 9. That is, a 2 bit signal from the ROM 36 is applied to inputs 1 and 2 corresponding to two most significant bits, a 4 bit signal from the third circuit 40 is applied to inputs 3 to 6 , a 3 bit signal from a one line delay circuit 62 as later described is applied to inputs 7 to 9 , and a 1 bit signal from a one pixel delay circuit 61 is applied to input The ROM 50 has two bit outputs The output signal 00 of the total picture type decision ROM 50 corresponds to a dot picture, indicating that the picture information signal is to be averaged. The output signal 01 corresponds to an ordinary picture which falls outside the category of dot picture or character line pictures. The output signal 10 corresponds to a picture having sharp edges, indicating that the high frequency range of the picture information signal has to be stressed. The output signal 11 corresponds to a character line picture, indicating that the high frequency range of the picture information signal has to be stressed. That the most significant bit output MSB The geometric arrangement of pixels corresponding to the bit signals applied from the fifth circuit 60 to the picture type decision ROM 50 will now be described. Referring to Fig. 10, it is assumed that a pixel which is now being processed is i0,0. Thus, the output signal of the one pixel delay circuit 61 is an MSB output of the decision ROM 50 for the pixel i 1,0 adjacent to the pixel i0,0. The three bit outputs of the one line delay circuit 62 represent outputs of ROM 50 for pixels i 1, 1 i0, 1 and i1, 1 on the immediately preceding line. That is, one line preceding decision outputs and one pixel preceding decision output are fed back to decision ROM 50. The aim of this feedback is to reduce decision error possibly made in evaluating a pixel now being processed, by taking account of decision results for surrounding pixels. For example, if the surrounding pixels have been decided to correspond to part of a character, the pixel which is now being processed can also be expected to correspond to part of the character. For this reason, account is taken of the previous decisions for preceding pixels. The contents stored in the decision ROM 50 will now be described. As shown in Fig. 11, with respect to a case where all the MSBs of output signals J of decision ROM for pixels i 1, 1 i0, 1 i1, 1 and i 1,0 are 0, i.e., where a picture indicates a slow variation in density, in the decision ROM are stored the contents as shown in Table 2. In Table 2 above, the numeric values 0, 1, 2, and 3 stand for two bit information 00, 01, 10, and 11, respectively. The above Table indicates that when 1 2 0, and 3 4 5 6 1, the output J of decision ROM 50 is 00 . On the other hand, when 1 2 1, and 3 4 5 6 1, the output J of the decision ROM is 11 . To explain the significance of this Table qualitativly, the surrounding pixels have been determined such that the picture density thereof slowly varies and thus, even if a density variation occurs with respect to that pixel now being processed it is decided that such variation results from noise and the picture density still varies slowly. Next, as shown in Fig. 12, with respect to a case where i 1, 1 i1, 1 0 and i0, 1 i 1,0 1, the contents as shown in Table 3 below are stored in the decision ROM. Next, as shown in Fig. 13, in the case of i 1, 1 i1, 1 i0, 1 i 1, 0 1, the contents as shown in Table 4 below are stored in the decision ROM. Each of these tables is provided in the decision ROM for every one of 16 2⁴ values which can be taken by the 4 bit output signal of the feedback circuit 60. A sixth circuit 70 Fig. 3 selectively applies one of the three signals brightness picture information signal I, high frequency stressed brightness signal, and averaged brightness signal to the color conversion circuit 12 in accordance with the picture quality, i.e., in accordance with the output signal J of the decision ROM 50. As shown in Fig. 3, the sixth circuit 70 includes delay circuits 71 and 72 provided for synchronizing the output of this circuit 70 with the output signal of the decision ROM 50, a subtractor 73 to prepare a differentiating signal, a multiplier ROM 74, an adder 75 to prepare a high frequency stressed signal, and a selecting circuit 76. Output signals of the delay circuit 21 and LPF 23 of the first circuit 20 are delayed by the delay circuits 71 and 72, respectively. The output signals of the delay circuits 71 and 72 are applied to the subtractor 73 in which the differentiating signal is produced. This differentiating signal is multiplied by K in the multiplier 74. The output signal of the multiplier 74 and the output signal of the delay circuit 71 are added together in the adder 75, to form the picture information signal whose high frequency components are stressed. The output signal of the delay circuit 71, i.e., the brightness signal I, the output signal of the adder 75, i.e., the high frequency stressed brightness signal, and the output signal of the delay circuit 72, i.e., the brightness signal averaged with respect to 3 x 3 pixels are applied to the switching circuit 76. This switching circuit 76 selects one of those three picture information signals in accordance with the 2 bit output signals J of the decision ROM 50 and applies it to the color conversion circuit 12. In this way, the brightness signal The picture quality improving circuits 19b and 19c for color difference signals, as shown in Fig. 14, can be constituted by LPFs 120a and 120b like LPF 23 shown in Fig. 3, respectively. Namely, the color difference signals C1 and C2 are averaged with respect to nine pixels. Only the averaging process is sufficient for the picture quality improvement in the color difference signals. This is because the resolution of human vision for colors of a picture is inferior to that with respect to the brightness. For this reason, to sufficiently reproduce a picture, such a complicated processing as required of the brightness information is not necessary for color information. The output signals The binary encoding and dithering processings will now be described. In principle, character line pictures are binary encoded on the basis of a fixed threshold value, while other pictures are dithered. However, the character line pictures must be displayed with high resolution. Accordingly, a picture information signal whose high frequency components are stressed is necessary for reproducing the character line pictures. On the other hand, dot pictures are dithered since they must be displayed in continuous tones. In many cases, a dot picture information signal has very high frequency components, which is attributable to the nature of dot pictures. For this reason, when the dot picture signal is dithered as it stands, noise will appear prominently. Accordingly, an average signal is used for the dot picture signal. A picture information signal corresponding to a picture other than character line picture and dot picture are used as it stands. When the output signal J of the decision ROM 50 is 11 or 10 corresponding to character line pictures, the switch circuit 76 selects the high frequency stressed picture information signal from the adder 75. When the output signal J is 00 corresponding to dot pictures, the switching circuit 76 selects the averaged picture information signal from the delay circuit 72. In case of pictures other than character line pictures, sharply edged pictures, or dot pictures, the output signal J is 01 , causing the switching circuit 76 to select the output signal of the delay circuit 71, i.e., the non processed brightness signal I. As mentioned before, the picture information signals According to the above mentioned arrangement, in the case of character line pictures, a picture information signal read by the image sensor has its high frequency components intensified and is then binary encoded on the basis of a fixed threshold value. Thus, a clear output picture can be obtained from the color printer. On the other hand, where picture is a dot picture, the picture information signal is averaged and then dithered. Therefore, the noise which has been produced in reading the dot picture is eliminated. Where picture is other picture than character line picture and dot picture, the picture information signal is processed by ordinary dithering technique, whereby a pleasant continuous tone picture can be presented. A picture information processing apparatus according to a second embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to Figs. 15 to 21. In Fig. 15, a picture information signal I is applied to a simple binary encoding circuit 502 through an input terminal 501. The picture information signal I is an 8 bit digital signal corresponding to an output signal delivered from the image sensor as in the first embodiment. To simply binary encode the signal I the most significant bit of signal I may be used. One bit output signals of the binary encoding circuit 502 are sequentially stored, for each line, in one line memories 504, 505, and 506 through a multiplexer 503. 3 bits are simultaneously read from each of the one line memories 504, 505, and 506 to be applied to 9 bit address input of a first decision ROM 507. This ROM 507 stores first picture type decision codes each composed of 2 bits, e.g., 10 for a pattern including part of a variable density picture pattern near to character line picture, 01 for a pattern near to dot pictures, 11 for a pattern near to variable density picture, and 00 for other picture patterns. The 2 bit output signal of the ROM 507 is applied to an integral decision ROM 508. On the other hand, the picture information signal I from the input terminal 501 is binary encoded in a comparator 509 on the basis of variable threshold values, i.e., dithered. This comparator is supplied with threshold value data from ROM 510 storing 3 x 3 threshold values. To the address input of ROM 510 are coupled a counter 511 for counting pixels in the main scanning direction line direction of the array of 3 x 3 pixels, and a counter 512 for counting pixels in the sub scanning direction the direction perpendicular to the line direction . Thus, addresses of ROM 510 are sequentially designated, whereby threshold value data arranged in accordance with 3 x 3 pixel array are sequentially read out. As a result, the picture information signal I is dithered in the comparator 509. The dithered picture information signal is sequentially stored for each line in one line memories 514, 515, and 516 through a multiplexer 513. 3 bits are simultaneously read from these memories to access a second decision ROM 517. In this ROM are stored second picture type decision codes each composed of 1 bit, e.g., 1 for a variable density pattern which slowly varies, and 0 for other picture patterns. The second picture type decision code signal from the ROM 517 is applied to the decision ROM 508. The decision ROM 508 is accessed by the first picture type decision 2 bit code signal, the second picture type decision 1 bit code signal, and the 1 bit signal which indicates a preceding decision result of a latch circuit 518 which holds a 1 bit output signal of ROM 508, to thereby integrally determine the type of an input picture. The decision ROM 508 discriminates character line pictures from other pictures in response to a 4 bit address input signal mentioned. A 1 bit decision output signal of the ROM 508 is coupled to a multiplexer 523 to selectively couple one of output signals 520 and 521 of one line memories 505 and 515 to output 522. The picture type decision principle used in the embodiment of Fig. 15 will now be explained. Figs. 16A, 16B and 16C show part of binary encoded patterns well produced when binary encoding a picture information signal corresponding to character line pictures. As can be seen, with character line pictures white or black appears somewhat continuously. Part of a variable density picture, as well, represents such a pattern. On the other hand, dot picture in many cases present such patterns as shown in Figs. 17A, 17B and 17C. A variable density picture well presents such patterns as shown in Figs. 18A, 18B, 18C and 18D. Part of characters also presents such patterns as with the variable density picture. The use of binary encoding patterns for 3 x 3 pixels would make it possible to roughly discriminate between character line picture, dot picture, and variable density picture. Picture discrimination by binary encoding patterns based on the use of variable threshold values will now be described. Fig. 19 shows an example of variable threshold value table. The numeric values of 1 to 9 represent nine levels of picture density. Where 3 x 3 pixels each having a density of level 5 are binary encoded on the basis of this variable threshold value table, the resultant binary encoding pattern becomes as shown in Fig. 20A. Where picture density varies showly as in a variable density picture, the density variation within the 3 x 3 pixel array is, usually, to an extent of 1 or 2 levels. For example, where the 3 x 3 pixels each have a density of level 5 and the variation in density is 1, the binary encoding pattern varies as shown in Fig. 20B or 20C. With respect to such a pattern, the second decision ROM 517 stores 1 which indicates the variable density picture. Where a density level variation within the 3 x 3 pixel array is as wide as 4 levels as shown in Fig. 20D, the picture cannot be regarded as a variable density picture whose density slowly varies. With respect to such a pattern, the ROM 517 stores 0 . In this way, a variable density picture can be discriminated by the second decision ROM 517 from other pictures. Pictures are continuous. Therefore, the decision on the preceding pixel is very likely to apply to the pixel which is now being processed. Therefore, if a feedback loop having a memory such as latch circuit 518 is provided for decision ROM 508, the acuracy of the decision will be increased. The embodiment of Fig. 15 may also be applied to processing of color information signals. As shown in Fig. 21, R, G, and B picture information signals are converted, in a matrix circuit 570, into a brightness signal I, and color difference signals C1 and C2. Further, color conversion circuit 572 provides color picture information signal M, C, and Y. These color picture information signals are applied to a color printer 574 through a binary encoding dithering selecting circuit 573. The brightness signal I from matrix circuit 570 is also applied to a decision circuit 571 as shown in Fig. 21. Decision circuit 571 includes a total decision ROM, which switches the binary encoding dithering selecting circuit 573. The character line pictures are binary encoded on the basis of a fixed threshold value, while the other pictures are dithered. In this way, even in case of color pictures, character line pictures can be displayed with high resolution, and variable density pictures and dot pictures can be faithfully displayed in proper continuous tone. A picture information processing apparatus according to a third embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to Fig. 22. The picture information signal is applied to a binary encoding circuit 602 through an input terminal 601. In this binary encoding circuit 602, the picture information signal is binary encoded on the basis of a fixed threshold value. As stated before, for simplification, the most significant bit of the picture information signal may be used as the binary signal. The binary signal from the binary encoding circuit 602 is sequentially stored for each line in one line memories 604, 605, and 606 through a multiplexer 603. 3 bits are simultaneously read out from the one line memories to access ROM 607. This ROM 607 previously stores a code 1 with respect to a character pattern, and stores a code 0 with respect to other picture patterns. An output code of ROM 607 is applied to a decision ROM 608, which is accessed by 1 bit output signal of ROM 607 and a 1 bit output signal of a latch circuit 609 which holds an output signal of ROM 608. The decision ROM switches the binary encoding dithering circuit 610 so as to binary encode, when the input picture is a character, the picture information signal on the basis of a fixed threshold value, and dither the picture information signal when the input picture is another picture. The picture information signal thus binary encoded or dithered is applied to printer 611. In this third embodiment, by utilizing the continuity of characters in white or black as in the second embodiment, the characters are discriminated from other pictures. In case of the color pictures, the arrangement shown in Fig. 21 can be used.
