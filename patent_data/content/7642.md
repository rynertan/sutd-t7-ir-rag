# Magnetic recording medium.

## Abstract
Improved magnetic recording medium, particularly magnetic tape suitable for sound recording and video record ing, which comprises as a recording element a mixture of cobalt containing iron oxide magnetic particles consisting essentially of ferromagnetic iron oxide particles containing cobalt and optionally a divalent iron in the most outer layer thereof, and γ ferric oxide particles in the ratio of 10 90 to 50 50 by weight, said mixture of cobalt containing iron oxide magnetic particles and γ ferric oxide particles being applied to a substrate e.g a polyester film with a binding agent. The magnetic recording medium has excellent electromagnetic transducing properties and improved charging properties and is useful for conventional magnetic recording apparatus used at normal position with high sensitivity in wide range of frequency.
