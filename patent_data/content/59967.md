# System for the bidirectional simultaneous transmission via a two wire line for digital telephone.

## Abstract
System for the bidirectional simultaneous transmission via a two wire line for digital telphone, that uses a circuit of the adaptive kind for the cancellation of the noise caused in the receiver by the local transmitter owing to mismatchings along the line. A correction signal, correlated both to the symbols transmitted during this bit time and during a number of preceding ones, as well as to the line status, is subtracted from the signal to be sent to the receiver. The signal emitted by the remote transmitter does not affect the correction signal as it is encoded by a line code having no dc component. One version of the circuit to be installed in the exchange and another synchro nized with the received signal, to be installed at the subscriber s, are provided.
