## Description
The invention relates to a package filled with a water soluble toxic pulverulent or granular product. Some chemical products, in particular certain agricultural chemicals, are so toxic that they must not come into contact with parts of the human body. This requirement may present problems both in the filling of packages and in releasing the chemicals from the packages. The object of the invention is in the first instance to construct a package of the above type in a manner such that during the transport of the filled packages and during the release of the substance concerned from the packages, the risk of anyone coming into contact with the substance is restricted to a minimum. According to the invention the toxic product is situated for this purpose in a closed inner container consisting of a water soluble flexible material, the filled inner container is placed inside a closed outer container consisting of a flexible material which is resistant to water, both the inner container and the outer container consisting of a flexible tube which is closed near the two ends by a transverse joint and the end strips of the inner container are connected to the joining strips of the outer container in a manner such that between the contents of the inner container and the said joining strips there is a certain distance, and a tear line is made in an exposed part of one of the end strips of the inner container. The outer container which is not separately filled with product forms a protection for the filled inner container against moisture and mechanical effects. In order to release the packed substance, the outer container is cut open and the inner container is deposited in water where the film of the inner container and the toxic filling dissolve. Because the inner container is connected to the outer container in a manner such that it assumes an essentially fixed position in the outer container, good mechanical protection is achieved. In order to simplify the removal of the inner container from the outer container the tear line is made in the joint between the inner and outer containers. The filling of the packages without contact with the toxic substances may take place by making use of a device which consists of a first filling pipe, means for the metered supply of pulverulent or granular product to the filling pipe, means of placing around the first filling pipe a first continuous tube of film or laminate, means of making a transverse joint in the first tube and a tear line in the joint, a second filling pipe for receiving the filled packages, means for placing a second continuous tube consisting of film or laminate around the second filling pipe and means for making a transverse joint in the second tube. The said transverse joints are intended to be normal welded joints heat seals , although beaded joints are not excluded. The outer container could consist of a laminate of an optionally metallized film, kraft paper and a coating. It is noted that packages consisting of an outer container made of film and an inner container made of film are known per se US Patent 3,737,027 , but in these known packages both containers are filled with a product, for example each with a component of a two component resin. Moreover, the inner container is not manufactured from a water soluble material. Use of this known package for toxic chemicals would not solve the problems pointed out above. The invention will now be explained in more detail by reference to the figures. The invention is concerned with packages for toxic substances, for example agricultural chemicals, which must not come into contact with the human body both during the filling and packaging and during the transport of the packages and the release of the toxic substances from the packages. The packages shown in Figures 1, 2, 3 incl. comprise two containers 1, 2 consisting of plastic film or a laminate. The inner container 1 is manufactured from a water soluble material, for example from polyvinyl alcohol. It is filled with a water soluble toxic powder or granular product 3. The outer container 2 acts as protection for the inner container 1 against moisture and mechanical effects. Naturally, the outer container is manufactured of a material which is resistant to water, for example a laminate of metallized polyester film, kraft paper and a coating of polyvinyl alcohol. Both the inner and the outer containers consist of a tube which is closed at two ends by a transverse joint 4 or 5 respectively. The end strips 6 of the inner container 1 are connected at their ends to a transverse joint 5 of the outer container 2. In one of the end strips 6 a tear line 7 is perforated. The transverse joints are intended to be normal heat welds. In order to use the contents of the package, the package should be cut through approximately at the position of the arrow 8, after which the filled inner container can be torn out of the outer container making use of the tear line 7 and can be ejected into water. At room temperature the material of the inner container can dissolve in water in a short time for example, 1 minute and the toxic product 3 for example, a granular herbicide is released. Contact with the fingers or other parts of the body is entirely avoided. To manufacture the said package use can be made of the device according to Figure 4. This comprises two form fill seal FFS machines 11, 12 following each other. Each of the machines has a filling pipe 13 or 14 respectively, a supply device 15 or 16 respectively for packaging material which is wrapped around the filling pipe 13 or 14 respectively, a longitudinal welding device 17 or 18 respectively to weld the overlapping ends of the packaging material to each other to form a packaging tube, and transverse welding elements 19 or 20 respectively to close the inner tube and the outer tube respectively. The transverse welding elements 20 also serve to join the end strip 6 projecting beyond the transverse weld 4 of the inner container 1 to the outer container 2. The filling pipe 13 is connected via a funnel 21 to a metering device for the metered supply of toxic pulverulent or granular material. This device may, inter alia, be controlled by feedback by means of a weighing device which weighs the finished packages and transmits corrective signals to the metering device. The transverse welding elements 19 of the outer container are connected to a stationary support 22 and can only move perpendicularly to the direction of movement of the formed package. There are two pairs of transverse welding elements 19 between which a perforator 23 is situated for forming the tear line 7 in the packages. On the other hand, there is only one pair of transverse welding elements 20 which is mounted on a support 24 movable vertically upwards and downwards. The elements 20 can move on the support 24 perpendicular to the direction of movement of the package. A knife 25 with a stop can be mounted in the elements 20 to separate the finished packages from each other. It will be clear that the filling of the packages with a toxic substance takes place fully automatically and without human contact. As is made clear above, the dissolving of the toxic substance in water can also take place without contact with the hands. A package for 1 kg of granular herbicide having a density of 0.8 0.9 g cmÂ³ and a grain size between 0.5 and 1.0 mm consisted of an outer container with a length of 385 mm and a width of 215 mm, the sheet from which the outer container was made having a width of 450 mm. The material of the outer container was a laminate of the following composition The inner package manufactured from a polyvinyl alcohol film having a thickness of 35 micron had a length of 275 mm and a width of 165 mm. The initial sheet had a width of 350 mm. This film could dissolve in water at ambient temperature within one minute. The film thickness can be somewhat greater, for example 50 or 70 micron. It is important that the water soluble container occupies a fixed position inside a flexible outer container resistant to water and that after the cutting open of the package the inner package with its dangerous contents remains inside the outer package until it is torn safely out of the outer container along the tear line. Within the scope of the invention various changes are possible in the described package and manufacturing device.
