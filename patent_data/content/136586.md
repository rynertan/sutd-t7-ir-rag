Now, the preparation of the compounds of the present invention is described according to the definition of R1 of the general formula I . A The derivatives of the general formula I wherein R1 is a hydroxyl group, i.e. 21 ol derivatives represented by the general formula Ia EMI8.1 wherein A, X, Y, R2, m, n and R3 have the same significance as defined in the general formula I i. The derivatives are prepared by reacting a 17a,21 diol derivative of the formula IV with an orthoester derivative of the formula V under acidic conditions to obtain a 17a,21cyclic orthoester derivative of the formula VI and hydrolyzing the 17a,21 cyclic orthoester derivative under acidic conditions.The reaction is shown by the following equation.

The compounds to be tested are dissolved in a mixture of the suspending medium pyridine diethyl ether 1 4 5 and mixed with equal volume of dimethyl ether containing 10 croton oil and the mixture is used as the test liquid. Commercially available felt having a thickness of 5 mm is cut in 7mm x 7 mm square and adhered to ring tweezers using alkyl a cyanoacrylate. The felt is soaked in the test liquid and the liquid is applied to the right ear of the mouse by rubbing it with the felt at a fixed pressure without anesthesia.The left ear is left untreated. At 5th hours after application, mice are killed and both of the ears are cut and weighed. The rate z of increase in the weight of right ear against that of left ear is calculated as the edema ratio. Edema ratios obtained on the test compounds are compared with those obtained on control and edema repressing rate is obtained.2 Experiment on thymolytic action Male rats of Wistar strain having a body weight of 120 150 g are divided at random into groups, each consisting of 8 rats. The compounds to be tested are dissolved in a liquid consisting of croton oil cotton seed oil ethanol 1 89 10 and the solution is used for injection. The rats are anesthesized by inhalation of ether and 20 ml of air are subcutaneously injected into hypodermic organ at the back of the rats using a thin injection needle to form an oval shaped air cavity. After the rats recovered from anesthesia they are kept on normal food and water. At 8th days after injection, rats are killed by depletion and dissected. The thymus gland is taken out and the wet weight is measured,Thymus weights obtained on the test compounds are divided with those obtained on control, and thymus gland atrophy rate is obtained. Results In each of the experiments on anti inflammatory activity and thymolytic action, clobetasol 17 propionate and betamethasone 17,21 dipropionate are used standard compounds and anti inflammatory activity ratio and thymolytic activity ratio against clobetasol 17 propionate are calculated using linear regression parallel test method. The results are shown in Table 1 below. In the table, the compounds are indicated by relevant Example numbers or Comparative Example numbers.

With respect to thymolytic action, all the compounds of the present invention have weaker action than clobetasol 17 propionate. Thus, since the present compounds have very weak systemic side effects and strong topical anti inflammatory activity, it is obvious that they are useful compounds.
