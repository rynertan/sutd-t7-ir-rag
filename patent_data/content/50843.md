# Digital scan converter.

## Abstract
A digital scan converter employed in a sector scanning ultrasound diagnostic device has a digital memory 22 for storing a received image signal in a cell whose address corresponds to the picture element and a system controller 42 for reading out a signal from the memory 22 by linear scanning. The digital scan converter is further provided with a signal generator 18 and an adder 16 for shifting the level of the image signal by a predetermined value when the signal is written in the memory 2 , a level detector 26 for detecting whether or not the signal read out from the memory 22 is at level 0 and an interpolating section 24, 34 for converting the output signal from the memory 22 into an interpolating signal by the output from the level detector 26 .
