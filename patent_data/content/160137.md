# Recording member having a variable thickness recording layer.

## Abstract
In a magnetic recording disk, the thickness of the recording layer 34 at the inner track zone 14 , i.e. the area of the disk displaced toward the central hub of the disk, is thinner than the thickness of the recording layer radially displaced outwardly from this inner track zone. During construction of the disk a positive charge is induced onto those areas which will correspond to the inner track zone of the recording layer by contact of these areas with an anodic metal which is more electropositive than any metal compo nent of the recording layer.

## Description
RECORDING MEMBER HAVING A VARIABLE THICKNESS RECORDINGLAYER This invention relates to a magnetic recording disk and to a process of preparing the same. For the storage of large amounts of material in the computer industry, disks containing magnetic recording layers are routinely used. Recent advances in the technology associated with the use of these disks has resulted in achieving higher and higher bit densities on smaller disks. Routinely, presently, five inch 12.7cm disks now are utilized where 14 inch 35.6cm disks were used in the past. The use of these smaller diameter disks are the direct result of achieving increases in the bit density on the recording layers of the disks. It is known that the use of thinner film thicknesses for the recording layer results in the achievement of higher bit densities. This is especially true at higher frequencies wherein the thinner the film thickness of the recording media the higher the output of the bits recorded thereon. The recording disks are spun under a transducer or recording head. Present technology allows the placement of the recording head at a flight height approaching zero with respect to the uppermost layer of the disk. Because the flight height of the recording head does approach contact with the surface of the recording disk recording disks prepared such as those in U.S. Patent 4,224,381 are used to prevent catastrophic loss of the recorded media on that disk when contact is made between the recording head and the upper surface of the disk. The data which is recorded on the recording layer of a disk is located in tracks which extend outwardly from the center or hub area of the disk toward the outside periphery of the disk. Because the disk is round and because the center of rotation of the disk is at the center of the disk the velocity of the disk movement underneath the recording head is less at the inner tracks which have a smaller radius from the center of the disk than it is with respect to the outer tracks which are at a larger radius from the center of the disk. Additionally, the track length at the inner tracks is much smaller than the track length at the outer tracks. Because the track length at the inner tracks is less than the track length at the outer tracks there is a higher bit packing density at the inner tracks with respect to the outer tracks.Because the bit density is higher at the inner tracks the output at the inner tracks is different from the output at the outer tracks. In order to have a consistent interrelationship between the recording head and the recording disk it would be desirable to have a consistent output from both the inner and the outer recording tracks as well as all intermediate tracks between the same. In known recording disks it has heretofore been impossible to achieve this consistent output because all heretofore known magnetic recording disks have sought to achieve a consistent film thickness of all the layers constituting the disks including the recording layer. In accordance with this invention, there is provided a magnetic recording disk which comprises a sub strate having a disk central hub area, a circumferential rim area and an intermediate area located between said hub area and said rim area, at least one non recording layer located over said substrate disk and overlaying said hub area, said intermediate area and said rim area, a magnetic recording layer located over said non recording layer, and having an inner track zone overlaying said hub area, an intermediate track zone overlaying said intermediate area and an outer track zone overlaying said rim area, characterised in that the thickness of said recording layer at its inner track zone is less than the thickness of said recording layer at its intermediate track zone. Also in accordance with this invention, there is provided a process of preparing a magnetic recording disk, comprising electrolessly depositing upon a disk shaped substrate a metal containing non recording support layer, contacting said support layer with an anodic metal which is more electro positive than cobalt, said contact being at an area proximal to that area which will underlay the inner track zone of said recording disk and said contact with said anodic material producing an area of positive charge at said area of said support layer which will underlay said inner track zone, electrolessly depositing upon said support layer a cobalt containing recording layer, the thickness of said cobalt containing recording layer at said area of positive charge being less than the thickness of said cobalt containing recording layer overlaying the remainder of said support layer. The embodiments of the invention to be described herein provide a magnetic recording disk which approaches consistent output between the inner zone tracks and the outer zone tracks. Also a higher coercivity is achieved at the inner zone tracks with respect to those zone tracks which are radially displaced outwardly from the inner zone tracks, in view of the higher bit packing density at the inner zone. Further, the recording disks are economically produced and can thus be made economically available to the consumer. The magnetic recording disks of the invention, in addition to having the recording layer being thinner near the inner track zone, can also include other layers located beneath or above the recording layer with respect to the substrate of the disk. As such, magnetic layers and shield layers can be located between the substrate disk and the recording layer and further barrier layers and protecting layers can be located over the recording layer. Because the velocity of the disk with respect to the recording head increases when the recording head is located over the outer track zone the flight height of the recording head also increases. In an alternate embodiment of the invention the thickness of the recording layer at the outer track zone can be made thinner with respect to the thickness of the recording layer at intermediate track zone in order to improve output characteristics in large diameter disks wherein the radius of the outer track zone is substantially greater than the radius at the inner track zone. Preferably the film thickness of the magnetic recording layer at the inner track zone would be from about 5 to about 20 less than the film thickness of the recording layer at intermediate track zones. A more preferred range for the thickness of the recording layer at the inner track zone would be from about 10 to about 15 less than the thickness of the recording layer at intermediate track zones. In the preferred process of preparing the magnetic recording disk of this invention electroless depositing of the individual layers upon a disk substrate is performed. After electrolessly depositing any nonrecording layers which will underlie the recording layer the layer immediately underlying the recording layer is then contacted with an anodic material at the area wherein it is desirable that the recording layer be deposited thinner than in other areas. The material chosen for the anode is selected to be a more electropositive metal than metallic elements in the recording layer. In the preferred embodiment wherein cobalt is utilized for the metallic element in the recording layer the material selected for the anode would thus be a material which is more electro positive than cobalt.Preferably, when the cobalt is utilized as the metallic element within the recording layer aluminum and zinc are chosen as the anodic material. when the layer which immediately underlies the recording layer is contacted with the anodic material a positive charge is induced in this underlying layer at the point of contact with the anodic material. When the layer issediately underlying the recording layer is so contacted the positive charge will tend to disperse itself in a circular manner from the point of contact.Thus only a single point of contact need be made, however, it has been found that if a mandrel formed out of the anodic material is used to support the disk during the electroless depositing of the recording layer when such a mandrel is utilized the mandrel contacts the partially made recording disk at a plurality of points of contact. This results in a preferred dispersement of the positive charge. Alternatively to utilizing an independent anode for inducing the positive charge on the partially prepared magnetic recording disk, the disk substrate itself can be utilized as this anode. Thus, an opening can be formed in all layers lying between the disk substrate and the recording layer prior to electrolessly depositing the recording layer thereon to expose the disk substrate preferably aluminum, and induce a positive charge at the area of exposure of the disk substrate. If a reduction in the thickness of the recording layer is desirable at both the inner zone tracks and the outer zone tracks, the partially prepared recording disk can be contacted with an anodic material at the area corresponding to both the inner zone tracks and the outer zone tracks. Thus two areas of positive charge will be induced on the layer which will immediately underlie the recording layer. As with a single area of positive charge the disk substrate can also be utilized to achieve these two areas of positive charge at both the inner and outer zone track areas by exposing a portion of the disk substrate, preferably aluminum, at both of these zone areas. Embodiments of this invention will now be described, by way of examples only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is an isometric view of a typical magnetic disk in accordance with this invention Figure 2 is a side elevational view in section taken about the line 2 2 of Figure 1, however with the vertical dimension grossly exaggerated with respect to the horizontal dimension Figure 3 is an isometric view of a typical magnetic recording disk in accordance with the invention, supported on a first mandrel and including a diagrammatic representation of positive electrical charges induced onto the magnetic recording disk by the mandrel Figure 4 is a view similar to Figure 3 except with a modified shape of the mandrel Figure 5 is a view similar to Figure 3 except a mandrel has been eliminated and in its stead a portion of the substrate of the magnetic recording disk has been exposed through a small opening Figure 6 is an elevational view of a partially formed magnetic recording disk showing diagrammatically a distribution of an electrical charge different from the distribution seen in Figures 3 to 5 and Figure 7 is a side elevational view in section about the line 7 7 of Figure 6. As is pointed out in U.S. Patent 4,224,381 in general the higher the frequency of a signal supplied by a recording head to a magnetic recording disk the more desirable it is to utilize a recording layer which is thin Furtheriitore, as was pointed out above, the higher the bit density at any particular recording track the more desirable it is to utilize a thinner recording layer on 8 magnetic recording disk. With the trend in the computer industry for the recording heads to operate with higher frequencies, the need for thinner and thinner recording disks is increased, however, there is feedback between the computer industry and the magnetic recording industry in that as the makers of magnetic recording disks achieve thinner and thinner recording layers the computer industry is able to utilize higher frequencies for the recording heads.In any event currently with the continued explosion of computer use and other applications of magnetic recording disks the need has risen for better and more reliable disks. During the early growth period of the magnetic recording disk industry uniformity of the composition and the thickness of the different layers of the magnetic recording disks was sought. However, with the shift to the uttlization of higher recording frequencies for the recording head, the production of a uniformly dimensioned recording layer leads to variability in the coercivity between the inside and the outside racks of the recording disks. Typically a presently produced magnetic recording disk having a magnetic recording layer of a uniform thickness will experience a difference in the output between the inside diameter recording tracks and the outside diameter recording tracks.For instance in a typical five inch disk at one and one half inches measured from the exact center of the disk an output of approximately 1.5 millivolts is obtained while at 4.7 inches from the center of the disk the output will be in the neighborhood of 10 millivolts. 1 inch equals 2.54 centimetres . The present invention is directed to a magnetic recording disk wherein the thickness of the recording layer is reduced at specific zones compared to other zones so as to normalize the output of all of the zones. Fig. 1 shows a typical magnetic recording disk 10. The disk contains a center cutout hole 12 allowing for appropriately mounting of the finished disk upon a spindle not shown or numbered for use in storing and retreaving data onto and from the magnetic recording disk 10. A recording head also not shown or numbered is utilized in conjunction with the disk 10 with the recording head serving as the input and output of signals to the disk 10 for the transfer of information between the disk 10 and a suitable electronic appliance such as a computer or the like, Information is stored on the magnetic rewording disk 30 by introducing magnetic signals onto the disk 10 which are located in circular tracks.For the purposes of this specification the particular tracks wherein the magnetic information is stored can be divided into an inner track zone 14, an intermediate track zone 16 and an outer track zone 18. The exact radial dimensions from the center of the magnetic recording disk 10 of these particular zones 14, 16 and 18, of course, would depend upon the dimensions of the magnetic recording disk 10 itself. Disk size range anywhere from three inches minimum to approximately three feet maximum. More commonly, however, the disk would range from about five inches to fourteen inches. In Fig. 1 the dotted lines 20 and 22 generally delineate the inner track zone 14 with the dotted lines 22 and 24 generally delineating the intermediate track zone 16 and the dotted line 24 and the periphery of the disk 26 generally delineating the outer track zone 18.Depending upon the ultimate usage of the disk a cut out hole such as cut out hole 12 may or may not be present.Additionally, other locating holes may be located near the center of the magnetic recording disk 10 as would be appropriate for the particular disk drives which would be utilized to rotate the particular disk. In any event, for the purposes of this specification the magnetic recording disk 10 can be divided into these three zones 14, 16 and 18 as delineated above. In Fig. 2 the magnetic recording disk 10 shown inFig. 1 is shown in a sectional side elevational view, however, the view has been modified with respect to the ratio of the vertical thickness with respect to the horizontal diameter of the magnetic recording disk 10.For the purposes of illustration of the drawings the thickness of the magnetic recording disk 10, that is the vertical dimension, has been grossly exaggerated with respect to the diameter of the magnetic rec ording disk 10 that is the horizontal direction. In actual reality while the magnetic recording disk 10 may be measured in inches with respect to its diameter the thickness of the individual layers grossly exaggerated in Fig. 2 would be on the order of micro inches. The designation of the inner track zone 14 to intermediate track zone 16 and the outer track zone 18 has been carried over from Fig. 1 to Fig. 2. A typical disk utilizing the principles of this invention can be constructed as follows. A substrate 28 forms the foundation for the magnetic recording disk 10. Overlayed on the substrate 28 is a magnetic layer 30. Overlayed on the magnetic layer 30 is a shield layer 32. Overlayed on the shield layer 32 is a recording layer 34. Overlayed on the recording layer 34 is a barrier layer 36. And overlayed on the barrier layer 36 is an outermost layer of the magnetic recording disklo, being a protective coating.38. For the purposes of this specification the substrate 28, magnetic layer 30, shield layer 32 and recording layer 34 would be formed essentially as is described in U.S. Patent 4,224,381. For the recording layer 34, the barrier layer 36 and the protective coating 38 reference is made to U.S.Patent 4,124,736. For the purposes of this specification the particular layers 30, 32,34, 36 and 38 would be formed preferably by electroless depositing techniques as are outlined in U.S. Patent 4,224,381 and 4,124,736. The particular compositions of the individual layers would be also as outlined in these two referred to patents. Contrary, however, to the disclosures of U.S. 4,224,381 and 4,124,736 the recording layer 34 would not be formed as a layer having a uniform thickness across the entire surface of the magnetic recording disk 10. Instead the thickness of the recording layer 34 would be varied such that at certain zones as hereinafter described the thickness of the recording layer 34 would be thinner than the thickness of the recording layer 34 at other zones. For the purposes of illustrating this invention cobalt is considered to be the preferred material constituting the composition forming the recording layer 34. Typically for thin film recording layers presently preferred for the recording of high bit density t he thickness of the recording layer would be on the order of several micro inches as for instance two micro inches. Thicker recording layers, however, also could be utilized with the thickness of the recording layer adjusted with regard to the frequency of the signal of the recording head. Preferably the magnetic layer 30 would be pure cobalt, however cobalt alloyed with amounts of nickel or other elements compatable with cobalt for use in recording layers could also be utilized. In U.S.Patent 3,719,525, 6 1 j is described the use of a l cobalt of c hal 1 phosphorus alloy for a recording layer. Other alloys are also known in the art for the preparaton of suitable recording layers.In any event preferably the cobalt based recording layer would be appropriately electrolessly deposited upon subsequent underlying layers such as the shield layer 32 of Fig. 2 While it is preferred to deposit a magnetic layer 30 overlayed with a shield layer 32 directly underneath the recording layer 34 as per the teachings of U.S.Patent 4,224,381 noted above, the protocol utilizing the particular layers 30 and 32 need not be exactly followed. In any event one or more additional underlying non recording layers can be introduced between the substrate 28 and the recording layer 34. For the purposes of preparing the magnetic recording disk 10 preferably aluminum is chosen for the substrate 28. The aluminum substrate 28 can be overcoated with a zinc coating as per t,e teachings ofU.S. Patent 4,224,381 for the desirable properties resulting from such a zinc overcoating or the substrate 28 can be utilized without such an appropriate coating.As will be noted in referring to Fig. 5 below if the substrate 28 is a more electro positive metal than the metal forming the recording layer 34 the desired differential in the thickness of the recording layer 34 of this invention can be achieved utilizing the substrate 28 as an anode to induce an electrical charge onto particular zone areas of the partially formed magnetic recording disk 10. Any layer which overlays the recording layer 34 such as the barrier layer 36 or the protective layer 38 should be of such a non magnetic character that it. does not influence the magnetic character of the recording layer 34. Typical of such overlaying layers would be those as described in U.S. Patent 4,124,736. As with the layers which underlie the recording layer 34, those layers which overlay the recording layer 34 preferably would be formed by electroless depositing of the same upon the recording layer 34. As is evident in reviewing Fig. 2 the thickness of the recording layer 34 at the inner track zone 14 which is located adjacent to the central hub area or the cut out hole 12 of the magnetic recording disk 10 is less than the thickness of the recording layer 34 radially displaced outwardly at the intermediate track zone 16. The reduction in the thickness in the recording layer 34 at the inner track zone 14 compensates for the increase in bit density at the inner track zone 14 resulting from the lower velocity of the inner track zone 14 compared to zones radially displaced outwardly from it upon rotation of the magnetic recording disk 10. This increase the output at the inner track zone 14 to compensate for the increase of bit density resulting from the circular geometry of the magnetic recording disk 10. Because the recording layer 34 is thinner at the inner track zone 10 its coercivity is higher at these zones resulting in better performance of the magnetic recording disk 10. The decrease of thickness of the recording layer 34 at the inner track zones as well as other zones as hereinafter explained can be achieved by contacting the partially formed magnetic recording disk 10 just prior to or during the electroless depositing of the recording layer 34 thereon. By contacting the partially formed magnetic recording disk 10, such as a partially formed magnetic recording disk 10 having both a magnetic layer 30 and a shield layer 32 already deposited thereon, with a metallic material which is more electro positive than the outermost layer on the partially formed magnetic recording disk 10 a positive charge is created at the area of contact. Thus, for instance, in Fig. 3 a partially formed disk 40 is mounted upon a mandrel 42 such that contact is made between the mandrel 42 and the surface of the barrier layer 36 which is located at the cut out hole 12.The mandrel 42 is chosen such that it is a metal which is more electro positive than the material which will comprise the recording layer 34. For recording labors 34 based upon the use of cobalt, suitable materials for the mandrel 42 would be aluminum, zinc or other such anodic metals which are higher up located oward the anodic end in the electromotive series of mctals and alloys. Upon contact of the partially formed disk 40 with the anodic metal a positive electrical charge such as that depicted by the numeral 44 in Ftct 3 is distributed in the immediate vicinity of the cor, act between the mandrel 42 and the partially formed disk 40. Upon placement of the partially formed disk 40 into an appropriate solution for electroless depositing of the recording layer 34, the presence of the positive charge 44 at the area which will underlie the inner track zone 14 suppresses the initial depositing of the recording layer 34 at this area. An initial deposit of material which will form the recording layer 34 starts in those areas wherein the positive charge 44 is not located such as the intermediate track zone 16 and the outer track zone 18.Upon continous depositing of the recording layer 34 onto the partially formed disk 40 eventually the positive chargc 44 is overcome and material starts to deposit at this area also. The recording layer 34 which is deposited at the inner track zone 14, since its depositing was Euppressed, ultimately is thinner than those areas wherein depositing of the material forming the recording layer 34 occurred for a longer period of time. This results in a somewhat concave upper surface for the recording layer 34 wherein the radius of curvature of this concave upper surface is measured in angstroms. While the actual differepces in the thickness of the recording layer 34 at zones 14 and 16 is small it is, however, sufficient to compensate for the increase bit density which will occur at the inner tracK zone 14. Because of the presence of the positive charge 44 wherein the anodic material contacts the partially formed disk 40 the plating of the recording layer 34 is initially retarded and the recording layer 34 plates from the outside toward the center of the partially formed disk 40. In certain instances it may be desirable to have both the inner track zone 14 and the outer track zone 18 of a reduced thickness compared to the intermediate track zone 16 and as such as seen jn Fig. 6 a positive charge can be induced at botr the inner track zone 14 and the outer track zone 18. In this case plating is retarded at both of these areas with respect to the intermediate track zone 16 resulting in the formation of a recording layer 34 which has a reduced thickness at both the inner track zone 14 and the outer track zone 18.In Fig. 7 such a disk is shown. For Fig. 7 the partially formed disk 46 has a recording layer 48 located thereon which has a reduced thickness at both the inner track zone 14 and the outer track zone 18. The production of such a disk as is depicted inFigs. 6 and 7 would be desirable in those instances wherein the ultimate magnetic recording disk 10 produced would be of a large diameter such that there would be an extensive difference between the track speed at the inner track zone 14 as compared to the track speed at the outer track zone 18. Because of the large diameter of disk the velocity of the outer track zone 18 moving underneath the recording head would be quite large and would drag along the air layer overlaying it.This would tend to lift the recording head up slightly because of the air which is being dragged along on the surface of the magnetic recording disk 10 such that at the outer track zone 18 the recording head actually lifts up from the surface of the magnetic recording disk 10 slightly with respect to when it is located over either the intermediate track 16 or the inner track zone 14. Because of the increased distance.between the recording layer 48 and the recording head in these large diameter disks reducing the thickness of the recording layer 48 at the outer track zone 18 as is depicted in Fig. 7 results in a more uniform output of the magnetic recording disk 10. For a magnetic recording disk 10 prepared as per the teachings of these inventions wherein the recording layer 34 is of a reduced thickness at the inner track zone 14 with respect to at least the intermediate track zone 16 the output is improved compared to conventionally prepared recording disks now known. As was noted above in a conventional prepared recording disk at about 1.5 inches from the center of the disk the output would be at about 1,5 millivolts. By constructing the recording layer 34 such that it is thinner at the inner track zone 14 the output ae approximately 1.5 inches is increased from about 1.5 millivolts to over 7 millivolts.Thus the output of the inner track zone 14 compared to the intermediate track zone 16 and the outer track zone 18 is normalized to whexe it only varies approximately 30 . This is compared to the almost 95 variance presently achieved utilizing conventional production techniques for currently available magnetic recording disks. To achieve these results it is only necessary to vary the thickness of the recording layer 34 between the inner track zone 14 and the intermediate track zone 16 from about 58 to 20 . Preferably, however, the difference between the thicknesser of these two zones would be from about 108 to about 15 . As was noted previously current recording technology requires that the recording layer 34 be of a very small dimension in the order of several micro inches. This difference between the thicknesses of the inner track zone 14 and the intermediate track zone 16 can easily be achieved by the utilzation of the above noted contact with an anodic metal to create an area of positive charge on the partially formed disk prior t the depositing of the recording layer thereon. Figs. 4 and 5 show two alternate possible ways of introducing this positive charge onto the partially formed disk. In Fig. 4 the partially formed disk 50 is shown suspended on a triangular formed mandrel 52. In this instance the mandrel 52 contacts the partially formed disk 50 at three points of contact instead of in a continous contact as is seen in Fig. 3. No matter whether or not B continous contact or one or more multiple points of contacts are made as is seen in Fig. 4 an area of positive charge 54 is induced onto the partially formed disk 52 such that during depositing of a recording layer thereon initiation of depositing at the area of positive charge 54 is retarded with respect to initiation of depositing of the recording layer at the other areas not so positively charged. In Fig. 5 an alternate way of inducing a positive charge onto a partially formed disk 56 is shown. The partially formed disk 56 has been overlayed with at least one layer such as a layer 58 which could be a shield layer, a combination magnetic layer or shield layer or the like equivalent to layers 30 and 32 previously discussed. in any event a layer 58 which is metallic in nature is located on the partially formed disk 56. This layer 58 would have been overlayed onto a substrate such as an aluminum substrate as previously described. A small opening 66 is formed through the iayer 58 to expose a portion of the substrate 62 through the opening 66.With the exposure of the substrate 62 an electronic couple can now be made between the substrate 62 and the outside surface of the layer 58 which induces a positive charge area 64 onto the layer 58 around the opening 66 of the disk 56. In this instance the substrate 62 is serving as the anodic metal to induce the positive charge 64. Now when the partially formed disk 56 is introduced into a solution suitable for electroless depositing of a recording layer thereon the positive charge area 64 induced onto the layer 58 by the electric couple passing through the opening 66 between the layer 58 and the substrate 62 retards initial depositing of the recording layer at the positive charge area 64. As described in the previous paragraph the use of the external mandrel or the like as the anodic metal to create the positive charge is not necessary. The substrate located inside of the partially formed disk 56 itself serves as this anodic metal. Since the substrate of the partially formed disk 56 is normally formed of aluminum or aluminum coated with zinc this substrate would be more electro positive with respect to a typical recording layer such as a cobalt layer and the variability in the thickness of the depositing of the recording layer upon the partially formed disk 56 would be achieved. In addition to locating an opening such as opening 60 near the center 66 of a partially formed disk 56 an additional opening not numbered or shown could also be located near the outer track zone of a partially formed disk to also induce a positive charge at those areas which underlay the outer track zone such that the recording layer deposited at the outer track zone would also be thinner than other portions of the recording layer such as the intermediate track zone.
