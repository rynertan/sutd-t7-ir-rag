# Process for forming a wear resistant layer on a substrate.

## Abstract
A process for forming a wear resistant, sintered layer on an iron based substrate which comprises steps of providing a first alloy sheet containing 94 to 99 weight of Fe Cr type alloy particles and 6 to 1 weight of acryl binder and a second alloy sheet containing 94 to 99 weight of eutectic alloy particles and 6 to 1 weight of acryl binder, placing the first and second alloy sheets in a superposed condition on the substrate, and heating in a non oxidating atmosphere to a temperature which is higher than a solids temperature of the eutectic alloy but lower than a solidus temperature of the Fe Cr type alloy.
