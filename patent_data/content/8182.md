# Coupling unit, in particular for an irrigation apparatus.

## Abstract
A coupling unit, for example, for automatic irrigation apparatus, comprises a probe 32 arranged to connect within a mouth 33 of a hydrant to receive a water supply from the supply line B connected to the hydrant. The probe 32 is mounted on a chassis 14 . The chassis has two wheels 10 by means of which it rides on an upper surface of the supply line B and guide wheels 12 which engage the side to the supply line B so that the coupling unit will follow the supply line B . The chassis 14 is also supported from a steering head 28 and a flexible coupling including a bearing 29 and a jack 31 , permits limited relative movement between the probe 32 and the steering head 28 to accommodate misalignment of the probe 32 with the mouth 33 of the hydrant. In an alternative embodiment the probe 32 is flexibly mounted on the chassis 14 which is fixed. In both embodiments a sensing mechanism 60 enables the probe 32 to be tilted relative to the hydrant.
