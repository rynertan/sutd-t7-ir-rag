# A volumetric sampling device and devices for measuring a whole day urinary output.

## Abstract
A device for measuring eg urinary output includes an outer cylindrical container 1 and an inner tubular container 2 in the outer container 1 for sampling the urine from it. The inner container is vertically fixed in the outer container 1 and they are openably closably communicated with each other at their bottom, and the inner container 2 is in openably closably communication 4 with a reservoir 5 . In another aspect, the inner container is a portable sampling tube used in combination with a packing plug. This plug has a hollow cylinder and a plug body having a head of trapezoidal cross section integrally formed with the cylinder and a cylindrical portion underlying the head. The inside diameter of the cylinder is substantially equal to the outside diameter of the tube of which the inside diameter is substantially equal to the outside diameter of said cylindrical portion. At least one opening is provided in the side surface of the cylinder.
