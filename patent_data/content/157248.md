# Method for driving a gas discharge panel.

## Abstract
An AC driving surface discharge display panel has a ma trix arrangement of a plurality of display dots each of which comprises a pair of display cell and selection cell. Firstly, all display cells on a selected line are simultaneously fired, by ap plying a firing voltage between pairing parallel display elec trodes defining said display cell line. Next, a discharge informa tion stored unwanted display cell among said fired display cell line is selectively erased by discharging an adjacent pairing se lection cell. An address sequence of the present invention comprising the line firing step and selective erasing step is performed with wide operation margin.
