## Description
SEMICONDUCTOR INTEGRATED CIRCUITS CONTAINING COMPLEMENTARY METAL OXIDE SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICESBackground of the Invention The invention pertains generally to semiconductor devices and, particularly, to integrated circuits containing complementary metal oxide semiconductor devices. Complementary metal oxide semiconductor CMOS integrated circuit devices include both n and p channel field effect transistors FETs on the same substrate.While, as known, it is generally desirable to space the different transistors as closely together as possible on the substrate, a limitation in the past is that if adjacent different type transistors e.g., p and n channel field effect transistors are too close together they can improperly electrically interact or latchup owing to the flow of leakage currents therebetween. One known solution is the use of dielectric material filled trenches extending into the substrate between adjacent transistors. One problem, however, is that semiconductor substrates containing such trenches have, in the past, been excessively susceptible to cracking. Also, to obtain adequate isolation between the adjacent transistors, relatively deep trenches have been required. The deeper the trenches, however, the longer and more costly the fabrication process and the more likely are the substrates to crack.Summary of the Invention We have discovered, as part of our invention, that a major cause of the cracking of prior art trenchcontaining substrates is that the trenches are often not completely filled with the dielectric material, voids being present therewithin. Based upon this discovery, the trenches used in our inventive devices are completely filled with the dielectric material, and, to facilitate obtaining such complete filling, the trench walls diverge slightly in the upward direction, but not in excess of 10 degrees from the vertical. In a further embodiment of the invention, the trenches extend into or to a region of heavily doped semiconductor material providing a barrier to leakage currents between the trench separated transistors. The presence of such leakage barrier reduces the depth of the trenches otherwise necessary.Brief Description of the Drawing FIG. 1 is a cross sectional view of a first embodiment of the inventive CMOS device and FIGS. 2 3. are cross sectional views of second and third embodiments of the inventive CMOS device.Detailed Description The invention is described in connection with an integrated circuit comprising a plurality of field effect transistors disposed within a substrate of silicon. With a silicon substrate, the trench filler material perferably comprises polycrystalline or amorphous silicon polysilicon hereinafter because such material can be readily deposited to completely fill a trench of proper design and because its coefficient of thermal expansion is the same as that of the silicon substrate. Both these conditions complete, void free filling and matching coefficient of expansion are essential to avoid the prior art problem of excessive cracking of the trench containing substrates. While it is known in the past to fill trenches with polysilicon, silicon dioxide is also used, and no distinction has been made, as far as we know, between the two materials with respect to the cracking problem.Silicon dioxide, we have discovered, however, is not a suitable filler material with silicon substrates owing to the great disparity in the coefficients of thermal expansion of these materials. Other substrate filler material combinations can be used. For example, it is possible to fill trenches in substrates of gallium arsenide with polycrystalline gallium arsenide deposited in known manner. In general, provided the filler material adequately adheres to the trench walls, filler materials can be used with non identical substrate materials provided the coefficients of thermal expansion of the materials match within a factor of about 3. Thus, for example, because of its ease of deposition, and because of an adequate matching of coefficients of thermal expansion, polysilicon is a good candidate for use as a filler material in substrates of gallium arsenide and similar III IV compounds. A first embodiment of the inventive device, depicted in FIG. 1, includes a substrate 20, of silicon, having a bulk region 30 of, for example, ptype conductivity n type conductivity is also useful provided by a doping level ranging from about 1015cm 3 to about 1017cm 3 Doping levels less than about 1015cm are undesirable because they require undesirably deep trenches to significantly reduce the possibility of latchup. The substrate 20 also includes a tub 40 of conductivity type opposite to that of the bulk region 30, e.g., n type conductivity, extending from the surface 50.The depth of the tub 40 is preferably greater than about 1 2 m, while the vertical integrated doping level of the tub 40, i.e., the integral of the doping level of the tub 40 over the depth of the tub 40, ranges from about 1012 to about 1015cm and is preferably about 1013cam A Adepth less than about 1 2 pm, and or a vertical integrated doping level less than about 1012cm often result in undesirable punchthrough from the source of an FET formed in the tub 40 to the bulk region 30. The device includes a trench 140 which prevents, or substantially reduces the possibility of, latchup. The trench is formed in the silicon substrate 20, and separates the one or more p channel FETs formed in the tub 40 from the one or more n channel FETs fabricated in the bulk region 30, i.e., the trench encircles the FETs in the tub 40. Preferably, the trench 140 is formed after the fabrication of the tub 40 but before the fabrication of theFETs, and is preferably positioned at the juncture of the tub 40 and bulk region 30. As previously noted, it is essential to completely fill the trench to avoid cracks which can develop during subsequent high temperature processing.A preferred filler material 160 is polysilicon which is readily deposited into the trench 140 using, for example, known conventional chemical vapor deposition CVD techniques. In accordance with this invention, to avoid cracks and or voids in the polysilicon, two conditions are preferably met. The first is that the angle denoted a in FIG. 1 between the trench sidewall 150 and a perpendicular to the substrate surface 50 is between about 5 to 10 degrees. It is found that trenches having steeper e.g., vertical walls or, worse, negative angle walls e.g., trenches which widen towards the bottom are quite difficult to completely fill. The diverging trench walls avoid any masking effects, by the walls, of the filler material during the deposition process. Conversely, trenches having wall angles in excess of 10 degrees become too wide, thus defeating the object of small transitor spacings. The second condition is that the thickness of the polysilicon deposited in the trench filling process is adequate to at least completely fill the trench. To ensure this result, a thickness which is slightly excessive is used, and the excessive material overlying the trench is slightly etched back using known processes. To prevent conduction of leakage currents, and diffusion of dopant, from the substrate 20 into the polysilicon 160, the trench 140 preferably includes a relatively thin layer of a dielectric material material whose bandgap is greater than about 2 eV 170 covering the interior surfaces of the trench. Useful dielectric materials include SiO2 and Si3N4 deposited in known fashion. The thickness of the dielectric layer 170 if employed ranges from about 200 Angstroms A to about 5000 A. A thickness less than about 200 is undesirable as being ineffective to prevent short circuits through the polysilicon. A thickness greater than about 5000 is undesirable as resulting in the formation of cracks and dislocations at the coating 170 trench wall 150 interface during high temperature processing. Techniques for forming the trenches, e.g., by known masking and etching procedures, can be used.Preferrably, the etching of the substrate to form the trenches is done by a known reactive ion etching processAs generally known, by controlling the etch rate of the process, the angle of slope of the trench walls can be selected. With reference to FIG. 2, a second embodiment of the inventive device differs from the first embodiment in that the substrate. 20 includes a relatively heavily doped bulk region 32 of, for example, p type conductivity, supporting a moderately doped, relatively thin compared to the bulk region 32 layer 34 whose conductivity type is the same as that of the region 32. The layer 34 is preferably epitaxially grown on the bulk region 32 using, for example, conventional vapor phase epitaxy. A tub 40 of, for example, n type conductivity, is formed in the moderately doped layer 34 and a trench 140 extends through the thickness of the layer 34 at least to the heavily doped bulk region 32.The advantage of this arrangement is that the depth of the trench 140 is reduced as compared to the trench employed in the first embodiment because the heavy doping within the bulk region 32 reduces the lifetime of minority charge carriers therethrough which would otherwise cause latchup between the two MOS devices shown. The doping level within the bulk region 32 ranges from about 1017 to about 10213, and is preferably about 1020cm 3. A doping level less than about 1017cam 3 is undesirable because so low a doping level does not significantly reduce the possibility of latchup. A doping level greater than about 1021cm is undesirable because so high a doping level results in an undesirably large out diffusion of dopant from the bulk region 32 into the layer 34. The layer 34 has a thickness ranging from about 1 vm to about 10 vm, and a doping level ranging from about 1014 to about 10 cam . The tub 40 has a thickness greater than about 1 2 vm but less than the thickness of the layer 34, and a vertical integrated doping level ranging from about 1012 to about 1015cam 2 With reference to FIG. 3, a third embodiment of the inventive device is generally similar to the second embodiment except that the depth of the trench 140 is reduced by the depth of a relatively heavily doped region 190 within the layer 34, extending from the bottom of the trench into the bulk region 32. The conductivity type and the doping level range for the region 190 is the same as that for the bulk region 32, and thus the region 190 is essentially an extension of the bulk region 32 into the layer 34.The region 190 serves the same purpose as the bulk region 32, i.e., it reduces the lifetime of minority carriers therethrough while decreasing trench depth . The region 190 is formed by implanting donor or acceptor ions depending on whether the region 190 is to be of nt or p type conductivity into the semiconductor material adjacent the bottom of the trench, and then diffusing these ions toward the bulk region 32 with a heat treatment. Because ions diffuse both vertically and laterally, vertical diffusion, and thus the depth of region 190, is preferably less than about 4 um to avoid undesirable lateral diffusion of dopant into the tub 40. Ion implantation preferably occurs after the formation of the dielectric layer 170 on the walls of the trench 140 and before the deposition of the polysilicon .Because the trench sidewall 150 is inclined to the vertical as viewed in FIG. 4 , and because the ions travel an essentially vertical path, the ions impinging the sidewall of the trench must penetrate a greater thickness of dielectric material than the ions impinging the bottom of the trench to reach the underlying semiconductor material. Thus, relatively few, if any, ions penetrate the sidewall 150 into the tub 40. If, for example, acceptor ions, such as boron ions, are used to dope the region 190, then useful dopant implantation levels dopant per unit area range from about 1014 to about 1017cm . An implantation level less than about 1014cm is undesirable because this results in an undesirably low dopant concentration dopant per unit volume in the region 190. An implantation level greater than about 1017cm is undesirable because so great an implantation level is more than is required to achieve the desired dopant concentration, and requires an undesirably long time to achieve.
