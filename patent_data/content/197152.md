# METHOD OF LOWERING FLOW RESISTANCE OF LIQUIDS.

## Abstract
A method of lowering flow resistance of flowable water type liquids and non water type liquids. According to the conventinal technique in this field, a macromolecular substance is added into a liquid which is flowing, the macromolecular substance being soluble in the liquid. The conventional technique is effective to lower the flow resist ance. However, the macromolecular substance in the flowing liquid is liable to be cut apart by the shearing force, so that the stability is lost. The invention is based on the discovery that the flow resistance of liquid can be lowered while maintaining markedly improved stability if an organic mac romolecular microfibril is added in a predetermined amount to the flowing liquid, the microfibril being insoluble in the liquid but dispersing well therein. The method of lowering flow resistance of liquids of the invention can be advan tageously adapted, for example, to transiting various liquids through pipelines, transiting petroleum through pipelines, and transiting liquid lubricants and lubricating oils.
