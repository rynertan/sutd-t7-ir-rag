# A multielement acoustic transducer, a method of manufacturing the same, and use of the same in an acoustic imaging instrument.

## Abstract
A multielement acoustic transducer comprising a metal plating 200 which is formed by plating the convex surface of a low melting metal having a plurality of convex semispherical holes and then fusing and removing the low melting metal, the metal plating 200 being used as a base electrode, a piezoelectric material 210 which is formed on the base electrode, and a top electrode 220a, 220b which is formed on the piezoelectric material 210 , the piezoelectric material 210 functioning as concave trans ducer elements.
