The starting compounds VII are new and can be prepared by the following processes. EMI18.1 wherein 1. is a protected hydroxy group, Rb is R2 is hydrogen, halogen or a halo lower alkyl group, Roc is a lower alkoxycarbonyl group, and A is a lower alkylene group. The compound VII is prepared by first reacting the compound VIII with di lower alkyl malonate step 1 , subjecting the resultant product i.e. compound IX to a deesterification reaction step 2 , subjecting the resultant product i.e. compound Cx to a decarboxylation reaction step 3 , reacting the resultant product i.e.compound XI with diphenyl disulfide in the presence of a base step 4 , and then subjecting the resultant product i.e. compound XII to oxidation reaction step 5 . Detailed explanation of the above steps is as follows 1 step 1 The compound IX can be prepared by reacting the compound VIII with di lower alkyl malonate in the presence of a base. Suitable examples of the di lower alkyl malonate may be dimethyl malonate, diethyl malonate, dipropyl malonate, ethyl methyl malonate or the like. Suitable examples of the base may include alkali and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, carbonates or bicarbonates e.g. sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, etc. , ammonium hydroxide, amines e.g. methylamine, ethylamine, diethylamine, trimethylamine, etc. and the like. This reaction is preferably conducted in a solvent inert to the reaction, such as methanol, ethanol, or propanol, at ambient temperature or under heating up to the refluxing temperature.2 step 2 The compound X and its salt can be prepared by subjecting a compound B to a deesterification reaction. Suitable salts of the compound X may include the same as those of the compound I . The reaction can be carried out substantially in the same manner as that of the foregoing Process 4, and therefore the reaction mode and reaction conditions e.g. solvent, base, acid, catalyst, reaction temperature, etc. can be referred to those as exemplified in the foregoing Process 4.3 step 3 The compound XI can be prepared by subjecting a compound X or its salt to a decarboxylation reaction. This reaction is usually carried out by heating the compound X or its salt in the absence or presence of a solvent which does not adversely influence the reaction and has somewhat high boiling point, such as toluene, xylene, N,N dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide or the like.4 step 4 The compound XII can be prepared by reacting a compound XI with diphenyl disulfide in the presence of a base. Suitable bases to be used in this reaction may be an organometallic compound e.g. butyl lithium, phenyl lithium, phenyl sodium, lithium diisopropylamide, lithium bistrimethylsilylamide, etc. , metal hydride e.g. sodium hydride, lithium hydride, etc. , alkali metal alkoxide e.g. sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide, etc. or the like. This reaction is usually carried out in a solvent which does not adversely influence the reaction, such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, benzene, toluene or the like. The reaction temperature is not critical, and the reaction is usually carried out under cooling, at ambient temperature or under warming.5 step 5 The compound VII can be prepared by subjecting a compound XII to oxidation reaction. This reaction can be carried out in substantially the same manner as that of the foregoing Process 7, and therefore the reaction mode and the reaction conditions e.g. oxidizing agent, solvent, reaction temperature, etc. can be referred to those as exemplified in the foregoing Process 7. Among the starting compounds II , V and VIII , new compounds can be prepared by the methods ofPreparations mentioned later and any process known in the art for preparing structurally analogous compounds thereto. The object compounds I and Ia and the compounds VII and IX to XII obtained by the above processes and steps can be isolated and purified by a conventional manner such as recrystallization, reprecipitation, column chromatography, or the like. It is to be noted that each of the object compound I and the starting compounds II to XII may include one or more stereoisomers due to asymmetric carbon atoms in the molecule, and all of such isomers of the compounds I to XII are included within the scope of this invention.
