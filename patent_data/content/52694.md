## Description
FIELD OF THE INVENTION This application relates to novel branced polycarbosilane compositions, to their production from selected monomer systems, and to their use in the production of silicon carbide. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART Silicon carbide has long been known and appreciated for its chemical inertness, high temperature stability, semiconductor properties, and especially its extreme hardness. The hardness of silicon carbide approaches that of diamond and boron nitride. Silicon carbide was originally prepared by reacting inorganic materials, for example silica and a carbon source such as coke or graphite, at extremely high temperatures. More recently, various methods for preparing silicon carbide from organic materials such as silanes and other organic silicon derivatives have been discovered. One widely reported approach is described in the following references U.S.Patents Nos. 4,059430, 4,100,233, 4,105,455, 4,110,386, 4,117,057, 4,122,139, 4,134,759, 4,147,538, 4,159,259, JapanesePatent Disclosure No. 1979 65,799, Nakamura et al.,Chemical Abstracts, 91 215596p, and Yajima et al.,Chemistry Letters, 5, 435 6 1976 . That approach provides polyrarbosilanes, some of which are soluble and thernoforrnble by standard methods, which can be pyrolized to silicon carbide. These polycarbosilanes are prepared by a pre pyrolysis rearrangement poly merization of cyclic or linear polydimethylsilanes, which in turn are typically prepared from CH3 2SiCl2 and active metals. More specifically, such prior art requires an active metal condensation of Me2SiC12 to polydimethylsilanes cyclic or linear , which are isolated and converted by application of heat and pressure in the case of cyclics to polycarbosilanes in a separate step, as illustrated by the equations EMI2.1 tb SEP Ha tb Me2S SEP iC12 SEP SEP SiNe2 SEP SEP NaCl tb SEP xylene tb SiNe2 SEP I SEP CH2SuMe t tb SEP Polycarbosilane tb The crude polycarbosilanes so produced are often subjected to further treatments such as vacuum distillation and fractionation by precipitation from a nonsolvent to isolate polycarbosilanes of particular use in making silicon carbide fibers. Such prior art contains some disclosures relating to starting materials other than CH3 2SiCl2. For instancc, Japanese Patent Disclosure Ho. 1979 65,799 contains an Example 11 inWhich CH3 2SiCl2 and CH2 CH CH3 SiCl2 are reacted under conditions similar to those contemplated herein. However, since they are reacted in a molar ratio of more than 19 1, no appreciable amount of silicon carbide is obtainable from the reaction product see Example F hereinbelow. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION it has now been found that novel branched polycarbosilanes which can be pyrolized to silicon carbide can be prepared in one step from simple silane monomers containing vinyl or halomethyl moieties.More particularly, this invention consists in a process for the production of silicon carbide which comprises, first, reacting at least one compound of the formula CH2 CH aRbSiXc CH2X d wherein R is lower alkyl, X is halo, a is O or 1, b is 0 3, c is 0 4, d is 0 4, a b c d totals 4, and a d totals at least 1, such compound or mixture of compounds being selected such that the average molar functionality as described hereinbelow of the compound system to be reacted is at least 2.3, with an active metal in an inert solvent at an elevated temperature to form a branched polycarbosilane composition, and, subsequently, pyrolizing the branched polycarbosilane composition in an inert atmosphere to form silicon carbide. The novel branched polycarbosilanes themselves constitute a key part of this invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In a broad aspect, this invention contemplates a process for the production of novel branched polycarbosilane compositions which comprises reacting, with an active metal in an inert solvent at an elevated temperature, a compound system comprising one or more monomers of formula I I CH2CH aRbSiXc CR2X d wherein R is lower alkyl e.R., of up to eight carbon atoms, and is preferably methyl 1 X is halo preferably chloro , a is O or 1, b is 0 3, c is 0 4, d is 0 4, a b c d totals 4, and a d totals at least 1, such compound system being selected such that its average molar functionality is at least 2.3 and the formation of silicon carbon bonds is favored.The monomer compound system of the present preferably contains at least two different monomers of formula I , at least one of which is characterized by an a b c d total of 3 or 4, in order to permit selection of monomer ratios such that the average molar functionality of the system is at least 2.3.Such branched polycarbosilanes may be described as compositions which comprise more than one unit of the formulaEMI5.1 wherein R is lower alkyl preferably methyl , a is O or 1, b is 0 3, c is 0 4, d is 0 4, and a b c d totals 4, with the three essential provisos that, in each of the plural units, a, b, c, d, and R may differ depending on the monomer from which they originate , in at least one unit, a d must total at least 1 in order to provide Si C bonds , and, in at least one unit which may but need not be the unit in which a d totals at least 1 , a c d totals at least 3. A further aspect of the invention consists in pyrolyzing, by means in themselves known to those skilled in the art, the novel branched polycarbosilane compositions of the present invention in order to produce silicon carbide and products containing silicon carbide. The following formulas wherein R and X have the meanings indicated above illustrate clashes of compounds which can be utilized in the formation of the novel branched polycarbosilanes of the present invention CH2 CHSiX2 CH2X CH2 CHSiX3 CH2 CHR2Si CH2X R3Ri CH2X CH2 CHRSiX CH2X R2Ri CH2X 2 SiX4 RSi CH2X 3 R3SiX RsiX CH2X 2 CH2 CHR3Si RSiX2 CH2X SiX CH2X 3 CH2 CHRSiX2 SiX2 CH2X 2 CH2 CHR2SiX R2SiX CH2X RSiX3 R2SiX2 SiX3 CH2X As indicated, it is preferred to use a mixture i.e. two or more monomer compounds selected from different classes to make the novel branched polycarbosilanes. Such mixtures include, but are not limited to CH2 CHRSiX2 R2SiX CH2X cH2 CHRSiX2IR2SiX R2SiX CH2X RSiX3 CH2 CHRSiX2 CH2 CHR2SiX R3SiX CH2 CHRSiX2 R2SiX CH2X R3SiX CH2 CHRSiX2 R2SiX2 R3SiX FUNCTIONALITY. A key feature of the present invention is the concept of the average molar functionality, F, of the compound system i.e. single compound or mixture of compounds from which the novel branched polycarbosilanes of the invention are made.Specific compounds useful according to the present invention can be assigned specific functionality values, f, as listed below Monomer Formula fTrimethylchlorosilane Me3SiCl 1 Dimethyldichlorosiltne Me2SiCl2 2Methyltrichlorosilane MeSiCl3 3Tetrachlorosilane SiCl4 4Chloromethyltrimethylsilane Me3SiCH2Cl 1Bis chloromethyl dimethylsilane Me2Si CH2Cl 2 2Tris chloromethyl methylsilane MeSo CH2Cl 3 3Tetrakis chloromethyl silane Si CH2Cl 3 4Chloromethyldimethylchlorosilane ClCH2SiMe2Cl 2Bis chloromethyl methylchlorosilane ClCH2 2SiMeCl 3Tris chloromethyl chlorosilane ClCH2 3SiCl 4Chloromethylmethyldichlorosilane ClCH2SiMeCl2 3Bis chloromethyl dichlorosilane ClCH2 2SiCl2 4 Chloromethyltrichlorosllane ClCE2SiCls 4Vinyltrichlorosilane CH2 CHSiCl3 5Vinylmethyldichlorosilane CH2 CHSiMeCl2 4Vinyldimethylchlorosilane CE2 CESiMe2Cl 3Vinyltrimethylsilane CH2 CHSiMe3 2Vinyldimethylchloromethylsilane CH2 CHSiMe2CH2Cl 3Bis chloromethy vinylmethylsilane CH2 CHSiMe CH2Cl 2 4Vinyltris chloromethyl silane CH2 CHSi CH2Cl 3 5Bis chloromethyl vinylchlorosilane CH2 CHSiCl CH2Cl 2 5Chlormethylvinyldichlorosilane CH2 CHSiCl2CH2Cl 5Chloromethylvinylmethylchlorosilane CH2 CHSiMeClCH2Cl 4 Note that vinylic silanes can add additional units of functionality in higher temperature reactions see discussion infra . These compounds are conceptually useful in the present invention however, they have not been reported in the prior act. These f values represent the number of bonds which each monomer can form with other molecules, including formation of both SSiC and SiS bonds, and can be used to calculate average molar functionality values, F, for polycarbosilanes prepared from known mixtures of silane monomers. The chemistry of bond formation is rtraightforuard, involving active metal dechlorination 1 or disilylation 2 of the vinyl groups.EMI8.1 When the vinylic organosilane contains no silicon bonded chlorine, reactions are observed at the vinyl group. Dunogues et al., Comet. Rend.. 278C, 467 70 1974 , have shown that at high temperatures the vinyl group can be polyfunctionalEMI8.2 The molar functionality, F, of a polycarbo silane is identical to that of the compound system from which it is prepared. For a polycarbosilane prepared from a single monomer, F is equal to f. For a polycarbosilane prepared from a mixture, the molar functionality F is dependent upon the molar ratios of the monomers as well as their f values.For example, F for a polycarbosilane prepared from a mixture of monomers having respective functionality values f1, f2, and f3, in the molar ratio x y z, can be calculated from the equation wfl yf2 zf F x y z Preferred molar functionality values for tractable solid polycarbosilanes are greater than two fas2 requiring that at least one of the monomers has an f value of 3 or higher, i.e., that the polycarbosilane is branched, rather than linear. The property which the polycarbosilanes of the present invention possess, namely their ability to be converted into silicon carbide compositions by ambient pressure pyrolysis, is believed to be due to their branched structures. The degree of branching and the molecular weight can be controlled, by appropriate choices of starting monomer systems and the molar ratios within such monomer systems, such that the products range from soluble oils to the preferred soluble solids to insoluble, infusable solids.While the branching structures of certain of the polycarbosilanes of the present invention derive from the inherent functionalities of the monomers used, the branching of other polycarbosilanes derives from heretofore unrecognized abilities of vinyl alkylbalosilanes to react at both vinyl and halosilyl groups and thus provide unexpectedly high function. amities. PROCESSING. In the present invention, a monomer system is.reacted with an active metal in an inert solvent at an elevated temperature to generate novel branched polycarbosilanes. The preferred active metal is potassium for reasons of high reactivity and low melting pointLithium, sodium, and magnesium are less reactive they may be used if longer reaction times are acceptable. Alloys such as potassiumisodium may also be used. The preferred solvent is anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. However, higher boiling solvents such as dioxane, 1, 2 dimethoxyethane, and the like, or hydrocarbons such as toluene, sylene, or octane, and the like, can be used, particularly with the less reactive metals. Hexamethylphosphoramide may also be used, but it is more costly and is a suspected carcinogen. The combination of potassium as the active metal and tetrahydrofuran as the solvent allows reactions to occur at the reflux temperature of tetrahydrofuran, which is just above the melting point of potassium. This combination does not allow significant reaction of chlorosilyl groups with the tetra
