## Description
AtTCLZC KETONE AND AtCOOL DERIVATIVESBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONThere is considerable demand for materials which are useful in modifying, enhancing, or improving the organoleptic properties of consumable products. The natural oils which traditionally have been used for this purpose suffer the disadvantages of limited supply, high cost, and variable quality. Accordingly, the search for synthetic compounds which can function as partial or total replacements for essential oils or which can be used to create new flavor and fragrance materials has intensified.Various substituted cyclohexane derivatives having useful organoleptic properties are known. For example, Arctander,Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, Vols. 1 and 2, 1969 Montclair, N.J.. U.S.A. describe the following compounds and their use in perfume and flavor compositions 1 166 para tertiary AMYLCYCLOHEXANONEEMI1.1 Very powerful, diffusive, woody camphoraceous odor, slightly earthy, yet with some resemblance to Orris root, overall very dry. 2 1749 1 EYDROXY 2 METHYL 4 tertiary AMYCYCLOHEXANE EMI2.1 Woody rootlike, dry sweet and very tenacious odor with resemblance to Vetiver, Cedar and Amyris. 3 2061 METHYL 2 iso HEXYL 4 CYCLOHEXANONE 1EMI2.2 Warms mild, hut tenacious musky orrislike odor. The.camphoraceous notes so often encountered in cyclohex anone derivatives, are pleasantly subdued and generally accepted as.

In addition, Chemical Abstracts, 89, 197052 k japanese Patent No. 78 895,942 discloses preparation of the compound having the structure EMI3.1 Finally, Chemical Abstracts, 68, 39828I L.M. Shulov, et al., Zh. Org.Khim., 3,1819 1967 discloses preparation of the bicyclic derivative having the structure EMI3.2 This compound is described as having the fragrance of fresh greens.Although the preceding compounds are known, no description of the compounds of this invention and no prediction of the compounds or of their advantageous organoleptic properties is known in the prior art. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Novel compounds, having the structure EMI4.1 wherein the dotted line represents either a carbon carbon double bond or a carbon carbon single bond wherein Z is eitherEMI4.2 and wherein each of R1, R2, R3, a4, and R5 is hydrogen or lower alkyl, are useful as odor modifying ingredients in perfumes and perfumed products and as flavor modifying ingredients in foodstuffs and tobacco products1The compounds may be prepared by treating substituted phenols having the structure EMI4.3 with isoprene or 3 methyl 3 buten 2 ol to form prenylated phenols having the structure EMI5.1 converting the prenylated phenols to the compounds of this invention.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIONNew flavors, flavoring compositions, perfumes, perfumed articles, and tobacco products can be produced by including therein effective amounts of one or more novel.alicyclic ketone or alcohol derivative having the structural formula EMI5.2 wherein the dotted line represents a carbon carbon double bond or a carbon carbon single bond wherein Z is eitherEMI5.3 orEMI5.4 and wherein each of R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 is hydrogen or lower alkyl, that is, C1 to C4 alkyl, particularly, methyl or ethyl. The compounds of this invention can exist in several stereoisomeric forms. Therefore, the structural formulae used herein are intended to embrace the individual stereoisomers as well as mixtures thereof.In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, compoundsI may be produced from substituted phenols having the.structure EMI6.1 wherein each of R1, a R3, and R4 are as defined for compounds I. Treatment of phenols II with either isoprene or 3 methyl 3 buten 2 ol in the presence of a mineral acid according to known methodology see, for example,J. Amer. Chem.. Soc., 80, 3073 1958 and Chemical Abstracts, 5Q, 1654 1956 results in formation of prenylated phenols having the structurEMI6.2 Phenols III may also be prepared by a modification of the method of Dewhirst and Rust J. Org. Chem., 28, 798 1963 which involves reacting isoprene with phenols II in the presence. of a catalytic quantity of the corresponding aluminum phenoxide.Conversion of prenrlated phenols III to compounds I may be accomplished by the routes outlined in Schemes A andB. Thus, as shown in Scheme A,. compounds I may be prepared by hydrogenation of. III in the presence of a metal catalyst such as palladium on carbon, or Raney nickel. In this reaction, solvents such as lower alcqhols, acetic acid, or mixtures thereof can be employed at temperatures ranging from about 250 to about 300 C, and at variable pressures, the exact conditions depending upon the product desired.For example, hydrogenation of 2,6 dimethyl 4 3 methyl 2 butenyl phenol in the presence of palladium on carbon at temperatures in the range from about 1500 to 200 Cd and at pressures from about 200 to 300 psig results. in formation of cyclohexanone V wherein R1 R2 CH3 R3 R4 J which is useful in perfume. flavor compositions.Alternatively, 2,6 dimethyl 4 3 methyl 2 butenyl phenol may be Seduced to alcohol IV wherein R1 R2 CH3 R3 R4 E in acetic acid with platinum oxide at temperatures from about 500 to 1000C and pressures from about 200 to 300 psig. The resulting alcohol also possesses interesting organoleptic properties. SCHEME AEMI8.1 SCHEME BEMI9.1 In addition, alcohol IV may be oxidized with a suitable oxidizing agent such as Jones reagent, pyridinium chlorochromate, or sodium bichromate sulfuric acid according to known methods to for the corresponding ketone V. See a. O. House, Modern Synthetic Reactions, 2nd ed., W.A. Benjamin, Inc., p. 257, 1972 .Ketone V may be converted to alcohol VI by reacting the ketone with an organometallic derivative such as aGrignard reagent e.g. R5MgXl or an organolithium compound e.g, R5Li wherein R5 is lower alkyl, that is, C1 to C4 alkyl. This reaction is desirably carried out with a stoichiometric quantity of the organolithium reagent or with excess 2 or 3 equivalents Grignard reagent.The reaction is preferably carried out in a suitable solvent such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon, and at. temperatures in the range from about 10 to 50 C.Hydrolysis of the resulting organometallic adduct is accomplished with ice cold dilute mineral acid, or preferably, with saturated ammonium chloride solution, and results in formation of alcohol VI. After recovery and purification, alcohol VI may be utilized in perfume or flavor compositions. In a further embodiment of the invention outlined inScheme B, the phenolic hydroxyl group in compound III may be converted by etherification to methyl ether VII. This transformation may he effected by known techniques. , See J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 2nd ed., McGraw Hill Book Company, p. 357, 1977 , . For example, the phenol may be treated with an alkali metal hydroxide such as aqueous sodium hydroxide, followed by alkylation with dimethyl sulfate at a temperature from about 25 to 80, Cg If desired, reduction of the olefinic bond in ether VII may be carried out with hydrogen gas in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst such as 5 palladium on.carbon or Raney nickel. This reaction, which is preferably carried out in a Parr reaction vessel at a pressure from about 20 to 80 psig results in production of saturated aromatic ether VIII Ether VIII may then be converted to enone IX by subjecting the ether to dissolving metal reduction involving treatment with an alkali metal, such as lithium or sodium, in a mixed solvent system containing ammonia or a lower alkyl amine e.g. CH3C012NH2 , an ether such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, and a lower alcohol.Desirably, the reaction is carried out with excess sodium 5 to 10 equivalents in liquid ammonia containing tetra hydrofuran and t butyl alcohol the ratio of ammonia. tetrahydrofuran t butyl alcohol being 2 1 1. This results in production of an enol ether having the structurerEMI11.1 which is purified by chromatography. The so formed enol ether can be hydrolyzed in the presence of an aqueous mineral acid e.g.. HC1 containing a cosolvent such as acetone or tetrahydrofuran at room temperature to produce enone IX which has valuable organoleptic properties.Reduction of the carbonyl in compound IX with a suitable metal hydride such as diisobutylaluminum hydride or lithium aluminum hydride yields alcohol X wherein R5 is hydrogen.Alcohol X is also useful in perfume or flavor compositions. Alternatively, the enone IX may be reacted with an appropriate organometallic reagent e.g. R5MgX where R5 is lower alkyl under conditions similar to those described above for ketone V this leads to formation of alcohol X wherein a5 is lower alkyl.Recovery and purification of the various final products of the present invention is achieved by conventional techniques including extraction, distillation, crystallization, preparative chromatographic separation and the like.The alicyclic ketones and alcohols of this invention possess distinctive balsamic, woody sweet, rooty, musty, earthy, leathery, citrus like, herbaceous odors, and. are useful in fine fragrances and in perfumed products such as soaps, detergents, deodorants, cosmetic preparations and the like.One or more of the alicyclic ketones and alcohols and conventional fragrance ingredients, for example, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, nitrides, esters and essential oils, may be admixed in varying quantities to produce desired fragrances. In this manner, perfume compositions may be prepared which are carefully balanced, harmonious blends and which include essential oils,. aroma chemicals, resinoids and other extracts of natural odorous materials, each ingredient imparting a characteristic effect to the total composition. In such compositions, one or more of the alicyclic ketones or. alcohols of the invention can be employed to impart uniques characteristics.Such compositions tay contain up to about 80 percentby weight of at least one alicyclic ketone or alcohol of this invention.

SucS concentrates may then Be employed to fomulate such products as colognes, soaps, etc. wherein the final concentration of the compound or compounds can vary from about 0.001 to about 7 percent by weight, depending upon the final product. F.or example, the concentration will be about 0.001 to about Q,I percent by weight in detergents, and about 0.01 to about 7 percent by weight in perfumes. and colognes.The alicyclic ketones and alcohols of this invention are useful as olfactory components in detergents and soaps space odorants and deodorants perfumes colognes toilet water bath preparations such as bath oils and bath solids hair preparations such as lacquers, brilliantines, pomades and shampoos cosmetic. preparations such as creams, deodorants, hand lotions and sunscreens and powders such as talcs, dusting powders and face powders.The alicyclic ketones and alcohols of this invention have also been found useful in altering. the flavor component or components of flavor compositions.. Thus, the compounds are effective in imparting a certain natural character to artificial flavors. They also can be employed to modify the organoleptic properties of consumahles such.as chewing gums, beverages, pharmaceutical preparations, fruit juices , and tha like. The specific flavoring properties of the alicyclic ketones and alcohols of this invention depend upon the type of product to which they are added. In general, they develop woody, earthy, minty, fruit y, citrus like flavor notes or combinations thereof. Therefore, they can be employed advantageously in certain citrus products such as orange oil to round off the taste and in pineapple flavors to enhance the taste and aromaIn flavor compositions, the concentration of the alicyclic ketones and alcohols can also vary widely depending upon the organoleptic properties desired Typically, interesting flavor effects can be obtained with concentrations from about 0.Q01 to about I percent by weight of the compound or compounds in the final flavor composition.In some situations, higher concentrations are required to produce special flavoring effects. ror example, in artificial flavor compositions, one or more compounds may be incorporated in amounts such that the tota l is 20 percent by weight or higher. One or more of the alicyclic ketones or alcohols of this invention may also he added to smoking tobacco or synthetic tobacco where they impart woody, amber like, and cedarwood notes to the tobacco aroma..
