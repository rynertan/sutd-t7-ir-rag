# Electronic still camera capable of editing picture recorded on disk.

## Abstract
An electronic camera 100 for shooting an object to store a still picture of the object in a first rotary magnetic recording medium 124 in the form of video signals includes a driving device 128, 130, 132 for turning the first rotary magnetic recording medium 124 which is detachably mounted, and a recording device 114, 122 for recording video signals of a unit of still picture on the first rotary magnetic recording medium 124 while rotating. The elec tronic still camera 100 further includes a first terminal 102 for receiving video signals of still picture read out from a second rotary magnetic recording medium 124a , a second terminal 104 for receiving a control signal in response to a reading operation of the video signals from the second rotary magnetic recording medium 124a , and a control device 118, 120, 144, 134 for controlling the driving device 128, 130, 132 and the recording device 114, 122 . The control device 118, 120, 144, 134 causes the first rotary magnetic recording medium 124 to be turned in response to the control signal received on the second terminal 104 so as to record a unit of video signals of still picture received on the first terminal 102 on the first magnetic recording medium 124 in response to the control signal.
