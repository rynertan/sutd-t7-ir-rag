The metal oxyalkylate is effectively applied to soil for assimila tion by plants, and is effectively fed to animals or hu mans as a food supplement or in food compositions. The invention also relates to therapeutic compositions which comprise, as active substance, an effective amount of at least a metal oxyalkylate, zinc oxyacetate being included among the contemplated active metal oxyalkylates. According to the invention, the metal oxyalkylate can be represented by the following general formula M O R O R C02 6 wherein M is a metal cation, x is an integer of 2 to 8, Ris hydrogen.or an alkyl group, preferably aliphatic, having from 1 to 7 carbon atoms. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the metal cation M is derived from a metal selected from the group consisting of zinc, beryllium1 magnesium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, palladium, platinum, copper, silver, gold, cadmium and mercury. Particularly, preferred metal cations are derived from zinc and manganese and their corresponding oxyalkyaltes have been found to have the structural formula M4O R CO2 6 wherein M is derived from zinc or from manganese. In another preferred embodiment of the invention, RC02 is a carboxylate group, preferably an aliphatic carboxylate group, preferably of 1 to R carbon atoms, preferably selected among formiate, acetate, propionate and butyrate groups. The acetate group is particularly preferred. According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, in the active substance of the therapeutic com position according to the invention, M is derived from zinc or from manganese and RC02 preferably is an acetate group. The therapeutic compositions of the invention preferably comprise an amount of metal oxyalkylate which is of 0.1 to 20 by weight. The active substance of the therapeutic composi tions can generally be administered topically or systemi cally, preferably in a mixture with a pharmaceutical carrier. For topical use, the active substance is prefera bly administered in an ointment or cream containing pre ferably from 0.1 to 20 by weight of the active substance. For systemic use, the active substance is prefe rably administered in a mixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier comprising petrolatum or at least one alcohol having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms or a mixture there of. The carrier preferably comprises petrolatum and lauryl alcohol in a weight ratio of petrolatum lauryl al cohol of from 1 10 to 10 1. In preferred compositions of the invention, metal oxyalkylate is in an amount of 10 by weight, petrolatum is in amount of 80 by weight, and lauryl alcohol is in an amount of 10 by weight. For systemic use, daily dosage is generally of about 15 50 mg of zinc for a person of average weight 70 kg . It is also an object of the present invention to provide an efficient and economic new process for making the metal oxyalkylates. As a matter of fact the process disclosed in the Fulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan, March, 1954, vol. 27, nb 2, p. 112 114, is a non industrial process. This method hasthe drawbacks of consuming time and being expensive, that is why it is preferred to prepare metal oxyalkylates, including zinc oxyacetate according to the process of the invention. The method according to the invention for making metal oxyalkylates comprises reacting a metal, a carboxylic acid, and hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous reaction mixture, precipitating the metal oxyalkylate, and recovering the precipitated metal oxyalkylate. referred metals include beryllium, magnesium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, palladium, platinum, copper, silver, gold, and zinc. Preferred carboxylic acids include aliphatic carboxylic acids containing up to eight carbon atoms, such as formic, acetic, propionic and butyric acids. The metal which is used as a reactant is free metal and is preferably in finely divided form, such as shot or powder, for facilitating reaction. The carboxylic acid is utilized in any convenient concentration, but relatively strong concentrations are preferred because it is preferred that the third reactant, hydrogen peroxide, is added in dilute aqueous solution and because it is preferred to minimize the total amount of water in the reaction mixture. Where the acid is acetic, glacial acid is readily available and readily usable. The amount of acid used is preferably not in excess of stoichiometric.Since it is a relatively simple matter to remove unreacted metal which remains undissolved it is preferred to use the metal in ananount in excess of stoichiometric relative to the acid. An excess of about 1.2 to 3 times stoichiometric is preferred. Hydrogen peroxide is preferably used in excess of stoichiometric. A weight ratio of about 0.1 to 0.5 parts by weight of H202 per part by weight of metal is preferred. The hydrogen peroxide is preferably used in a dilute solution of up to 10 H2O2. A 3 solution is preferable in some situations such as when using glacial acetic acid, since the total amount of water in the aqueous reaction mixture is appropriate when introduced in this manner. The amount of water in the system can vary widely and is preferably at least sufficient to prevent boiling without additional cooling. It is preferred that the amount of water is sufficient to prevent the temperature of the reaction mixture from rising about 900C without additional cooling. The reaction is preferably carried out at atmospheric pressure for reasons of economy and at temperatures below the boiling point of the reaction mixture. In general, a temperature of from room temperature up to about 1300C is preferred. After the reaction is complete, excess metal is preferably removed by filtration or by decantation of the liquid phase. Precipitation is preferably achieved by adding acetone and cooling, but may be effected by careful evaporation of the aqueous reaction mixture. The amount of acetone is preferably about 1 5 volumes per volume of the aqueous phase and the aqueous phase is preferably cooled, or permitted to cool, to at least room temperature before the addition of the acetone in order to minimize evaporation of acetone. The solution is then preferably chilled, preferably to a teMperature of less than 100C 500F , to precipitate the metal oxyalkylate. While chilling can be carried much lower, it is generally not necessary, in order to precipitate substantially all of the metal oxyalkylate, to cool below about 1.1 C 300F . The precipitated metal oxyalkylate is recovered by filtration or the like and drying. While the structure of the zinc oxyalkylate has been confirmed to be Zn4O R C02 , and that of the manganese as Mn40 R C02 6, wherein R is hydrogen or alkyl, the structure of reaction products of all of the other metals and acids has not yet been confirmed. However, the following general information is attributed M O R C02 6 where M is a metal, x is an integer of 2 to 8, and R is hydrogen or alkyl, preferably having from 1 to 7 carbon atoms. Examples of the invention follow. EXAMPLE 1 Preparation of zinc oxyacetate Into a 600 milliliters beaker are placed 50 g 0.765 gram atoms of zinc metal shot. Then 45 milliliters 0.767 moles of glacial acetic acid is added. To this mixture is added 400 milliliters of 3 hydrogen peroxide. This mixture is stirred at room temperature for one hour. The reaction liquid mixture is decanted to remove the unreacted zinc shot. Then 1 200 milliliters of acetone is added to the decanted liquid, and the solution is cooled to 4.40C 40 F . After one hour, the precipitate is filtered to yield 50 grams of white product Hexakis acetato oxotetra zinc . EXAMPLE 2 Preparation of zinc oxyacetate Into 2 000 milliliters beaker is placed 100 g 1. 53 gram atoms of zinc metal shot. Then 90 milliliters 1.57 moles of glacial acetic acid is added. To this mixture is added 800 milliliters of 3 hydrogen peroxide. The mixture is heated to 940C for 30 minutes with stirring. The unreacted zinc is removed, and the solution is chilled overnight in a larger container after adding 2 400 ml acetone to yield 115 g of white product Hexakis acetato oxotetra zinc . As mentioned above, the metal oxyalkylate can be added to soil as such or in admixture with a suitable carrier such as a fertilizer composition containing other fertilizer values such as N, P or K. The compound is also suitable for supplying metals to animals or humans and can be supplied in tablet or other convenient form in admixture with a suitable carrier such as a water soluble wax or other solid excipient. The compound can also be admixed with a food product for human or animal consumption, such as breakfast cereal, animal foods, and the like. The amount of compound that is administered will, of course, depend on the amount of metal which is desired to be added to the plant or ingested by the animal or human. For agricultural use, the amount of metal which is to be used may be determined by the amount by which the soil is considered deficient in a particular metal or by the amount by which the plant is considered deficient in that metal. Similarly, for animal or human use, the metal dosage may be determined by a dietary metal deficiency or by a metal deficiency in blood plasma, in body tissues, or the like. The dosage can vary widely for a particular metal, particularly for agricultural purposes.For zinc, dosages, in general, would typically be as follows Use DosaaeAgricultural 2 12 ppm in the soilAnimal 50 250 mg per dayHuman 50 150 mg per dayEXAMPLES 3 16 Example 1 is followed except that the zinc metal shot is replaced with 50 g of the following finely divided metals 3 beryllium 4 magnesium 5 chromium 6 manganese 7 iron 8 cobalt 9 nickel 10 palladium 11 platinum 12 copper 13 silver 14 gold 15 cadmium 16 mercury. The recovered metal oxyacetate reaction products are useful, in the manner indicated above for the zinc oxyacetate reaction product, for supplying the metal to plants, animals and humans. The amount of the metal to be supplied will, of course, depend on the metal desirable amounts of each to be supplied are well known for particular applications. EXAMPLES 17 20 Example 1 is followed except that the glacial acetic acid is replaced with an equivalent amount of the fol lowing acids 17 formic acid 18 propionic acid 19 n butyric acid 20 isobutyric acid. The recovered zinc oxyalkylate products are useful as indicated above. EXAMPLE 21 The compound of Example 6 is analysed and found to have the following structural formula Mn4O CH3 CO2 6 The examples which follow illustrate the use of the compositions according to the invention as anti virus, anti bacteria, or anti fungus agents.EXAMPLE 22 A stock 1 solution is prepared by dissolving 0.lmgof zinc oxyacetate in 10 ml of water. A 1 2 dilution 0.5 solution is made by admixing 5 ml of the stock solution and 5 ml of water. A 1 4 dilution 0.25 solution is made by admixing 5 ml of the 0.5 solution and 5 ml of water. A 1 10 dilution 0.1 solution is made by admixing 1 ml of the stock 1 solution and 9 ml of water. Fine filter paper discs of 1 cm diameter are placed in each of four clean petri dishes. In dish Wl, 0.1 ml of the 1 solution is dropped onto each filter disc and allowed to air dry. The same is done in dish 2 except that the 0.5 solution is used.The same is done on dishes ss 3 and 4 except that the 0.25 and 0.1 solu tions, respectively, are used..One ml of a previously prepared 1 x 10 4 dilution.of a broth bacterial culture Staphylococcus aureus is then spread evenly over the entire surface of four agar plates. At the 12 o clock po sition on each of the agar plates, a disc from dish 1 1 solution is placed. Discs from dishes 2, 3 and are similarly placed at the 3 o clock and 9 o clock positions, respectively, of each of the four plates. Each disc is gently pressed to ensure good contact with the agar surfaces. For comparison purposes, a further stock solution of zinc sulphate 1 S is made up and an identical series of tests made.Each plate is incubated overnight at 370C and the area of inhibition the clear area around each disc is measured.

HSV 1 has a tendancy to cause cell aggregate formation rather than distinct plaques. Consequently, two different concentrations of methylcellulose are used in the overlay medium, and finally, in the last trial a liquid overlay is used in an effort to get clear, distinct plaques. There are some variations in the results but, overall, with HSV 1, the Zn substance is less effective than the manganese compound in inhibiting HSV 1. This finding could be due to the lower solubility of the Zn material in 2 FBS MEM.EXAMPLES 47 49 Cytopathogenic effect CPE trials are carried out on the manganese compound and zinc composition ofExamples 40 46.

As is shown in the results which follow, the manganese compound is effective against HSV 2 but is probably not effective against HSV 1. The HSV 2 data are interesting because of the apparent viristatic action of the Mn compound rather than the viricidal activity seen with the Zn compound. Apparently at 10 1 dilution of HSV 2, enough Mn compound is present to inhibit the virus completely and cause an increase in the size of the BGM 2 each cells. At 10 and 10 , one tube in each dilution showed early inhibition of virus but later the virus manifested itself in the typical syncytial formation.EMI14.2 tb HSV 1 tb SEP Control SEP 10 3.5 SEP 1 SEP 10 2.5 tb SEP Mn SEP com tb SEP pound SEP 10 3.0 SEP Inhibition tb 1 approximate titer on BGM cells based on 4 100 CPEEXAMPLE 52 CPE trials for the manganese compound and zinc composition of Examples 40 46 are conducted as in Examples 47 51 on a nNA virus, Adenovirus type 4, usingKB cells human continuous cell line .
