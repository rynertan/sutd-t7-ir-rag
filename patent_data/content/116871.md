# A process for preparing an aqueous adhesive composition.

## Abstract
A process for preparing an aqueous adhesive composi tion which comprises preparing a solvent dispersion by mixing rubber, carbon black, vulcanizing agent, tackifying resin and accelerator with sufficient organic solvent to form a solvent dispersion and thereafter emulsifying the solvent dispersion in the presence of water to form an aqueous emulsion. The aqueous emulsion may be used to bond unvulcanized rubber compounds, such as a tread stock to the carcass portion during the formation of a tire.
