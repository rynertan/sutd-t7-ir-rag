# SECONDARY NOZZLE STRUCTURE FOR A GAS TURBINE COMBUSTOR

## Abstract
A combustor for a land based turbine comprises a generally tubular sidewall having a downstream mixing zone where a mixture of fuel and air is developed for downstream combustion. The sidewall further defines an upstream primary zone into which air is admitted through sidewall openings to develop an axial airflow for mixing with downstream injected fuel. Nozzles spray fuel in small rapidly evaporable droplets inwardly through the sidewall at a secondary location between the primary zone and the mixing zone for mixing with the primary air flow. A catalyst is coupled to the combustor sidewall at the outlet of the mixing zone. The fuel nozzles are provided with axial swirlers and are angled downstream to increase the uniformity of fuel air mixing.
