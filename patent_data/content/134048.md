## Description
There is substantial interest in employing industrial unicellular microorganism strains as hosts with recombinant DNA to produce polypeptides in high yields. Many industrially important enzymes, such as amylolytic and proteolytic enzymes, are produced by microorganisms of the genus Due to the genetic modification resistant nature of the industrial strains and their prototrophic character which makes them difficult to starve, they show resistance to transformation. It would therefore be of great value to provide for an efficient process for introducing DNA into industrial strains, where the DNA would be stably maintained in the industrial strain, there would be no loss or substantially no loss of viability and activity of the industrial strain and high yields of endogenous and exogenous polypeptide or protein products could be obtained. Furthermore, selection of cells is difficult where the modification or transformation of the host cells involves increasing the copy number of an endogenous gene or previously introduced gene, where the gene is not involved with survival selection. It is therefore highly desirable to have an efficient process in which the presence of additional genes increased copy number can be detected and selected for. Genetic manipulations of Minfeng Novel methods and products involving genetically modified industrial Methods are provided for the genetic manipulation of industrial Bacillus strains for use in fermentation for the production of polypeptide products in good yield. The resulting modified industrial strains retain the desirable characteristics of industrial strains, while providing enhanced yields of expression products of endogenous same species or exogenous different species genes. The method involves introducing extrachromosomal DNA into a bacterial host, which is capable of replicating the DNA and is readily susceptible to the introduction of the extrachromosomal DNA. The modified bacterial host cell containing the extrachromosomal element is then combined with the industrial The subject invention may be divided up into the following parts 1 preparation of the plasmid construct, including the gene s for which enhanced expression in the The gene s of interest may be any prokaryotic or eukaryotic gene. These genes may include bacterial genes, unicellular microorganism genes, mammalian genes, or the like. The structural genes may be prepared in a variety of ways, including synthesis, isolation from genomic DNA, preparation from cDNA, or combinations thereof. The various techniques of manipulation of the genes are well known, and include restriction, digestion, resection, ligation, Where the gene is obtained from a host which has transcriptional and translational initiation and termination regulatory signals which are recognized by the industrial Where the structural gene is from a source whose regulatory signals are not recognized by In some instances, it may be desirable that the expression product be secreted. Where the expression product is naturally secreted and the leader signal and processing signal s are recognized by the The structural genes may express a variety of polypeptides or proteins, such as enzymes, hormones, lymphokines, surface proteins, blood proteins, structural proteins, immunoglobulins, or the like, from mammals, unicellular microorganisms, e.g., bacteria, fungi, such as yeast, or filamentous fungi, algae, protozoa, etc., plants, or other DNA source. Of particular interest are enzymes, more particularly hydrolases and more particularly proteases and saccharidases. Illustrative of such enzymes are endopeptidases, exopeptidases, serine and non serine proteases, alpha and beta amylases particularly thermostable alpha amylase , and the like. There are a wide number of vectors which can be employed for the compatible host as well as the Depending upon whether one desires integration of the structural genes in the industrial In addition to the replication system, there will be at least one marker and there may be more than one marker, usually not more than about three markers. By marker is intended a structural gene capable of expression in a host, which provides for survival selection. By survival selection is intended imparting prototrophy to an auxothrophic host, biocide or viral resistance. For prototrophy, various genes may be employed, such as leu, ura, trp, or the like. For biocide resistance this may include resistance to antibiotics, e.g. neo, cam, tet, tun, kan, or the like. Other markers include resistance to heavy metals, immunity, and the like. The various DNA sequences may be derived from diverse sources and joined together to provide for a vector which includes one or more convenient, preferably unique. restriction sites to allow for insertion or substitution of the structural genes at such sites or in place of lost fragments to provide the plasmid construct. Once the plasmid construct has been prepared, it may now be cloned in an appropriate compatible host referred to as the compatible or cloning host. Any host may be used which is convenient, is readily transformable, and allows for replication of the plasmid construct and transfer to the industrial The cells are killed with a cytotoxic agent prior to or during protoplast formation. Various agents may be employed, including antibiotics, but iodoacetamide is found to be convenient, efficient, and does not interfere with the subsequent fusion. Protoplasts are prepared from the cells in accordance with conventional ways, e.g., lysozyme or zymolyase treatment, and the protoplasts are carefully suspended in an appropriate medium having proper osmolality for maintaining the integrity of the protoplast. The industrial The dead compatible host protoplast and the viable industrial The industrial The following examples are offered by way of illustration and not by way of limitation. Chromosomal DNA of The DNA was precipitated from the extracted supernatant by addition of 0.2 volume of 5M NaCI and 0.25 volume of 40 w v polyethylene glycol 6000, followed by incubation for 16 h at 4 C. After precipitation and centrifugation 30 min at 12500 rpm, Sorvall type SS 34 rotor the DNA was resuspended in 2 3 ml TE buffer as in Example I and the dispersion made pH 12.0 with 4 M NaOH. The pH was then adjusted to 8.5 and the suspension was extracted with phenol. After precipitation of the extract with ethanol and plasmid DNA was resuspended in a small volume of TE buffer. Plasmid pUR1523 cf. European specification A 77109 DNA from In the case of alpha amylase this was performed by looking for halos after covering the plates with a solution containing 0.6 w v KI and 0.3 w v I In the case of chymosin, positive selection was carried out via hybridization with To identify the gene for a The selected transformants were used as donor strains in cell fusion experiments. The transformed The genetically engineered production strain of Comparable results were obtained with the plasmid pLP33, which introduction improved the production of protease and with plasmid pLC87 which introduction resulted in a Table I shows the summarized results of a quantification of the improvements of the respective genetically engineered microorganisms. The subject method has shown itself as highly successful with It is evident from the above results that a simple and efficient procedure is provided for stably introducing homologous or heterologous genes into industrial Although the foregoing invention has been described in some detail by way of illustration and example for purposes of clarity of understanding, it will be obvious that certain changes and modifications may be practiced within the scope of the appended claims.
