# Highly viscous polysaccharides and process for the preparation of said polysaccharides.

## Abstract
Novel highly viscous polysaccharides composed mainly of a glucose, b galactose, c mannose, and d glucurontic acid, the molar ratio of a b c d being 10 3 6 0.5 2 0.5 2 preferably 10 3 1 1 2 1 2 . The invention also provides the process for producing the highly viscous polysaccharides which comprises cultivating a highly vis cous polysaccharide producing microorganism which is an acetic acid bacteria in a nutrient medium until a substantial amount of polysaccharides has accumulated in the nutrient medium, and recoverting the accumulated polysaccharides from the nutrient medium.
