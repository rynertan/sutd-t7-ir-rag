# Formation tester tool.

## Abstract
A formation tester tool 10 has a snorkel 36 for extending laterally to penetrate a formation, whilst back up shoes 38,48 locate the tool in the borehole. A seal 32 is provided around the snorkel 36 to isolate it from well bore fluids drilling mud . To overcome sticking problems upon attempted retraction of the snorkel after testing, release means 50,60 are provided which are actuable to bear against the wall of the borehole to push the tool laterally to release the snorkel and or seal from engagement with the formation. The release means suitably comprise pads 50, 60 on hydraulically actuable pistons 52,54,56 62,64,66 .
