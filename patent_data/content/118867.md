The dried Na2SO4 organic phase was concentrated to an oil 9.Og which was subjected to HPLC purification silica gel column, 10 ethyl acetate in hexane, W detector to afford after concentration of the product containing fractions 7.37g of an oil.The oil was subjected to further concentration in vacuo at 600C to give 7.13g 75.8 of an oil.ANALYSIS Calculated for C20H24O5S 63.81 C 6.43 HFound 63.69 C 6.50 H EXAMPLE 13 4 4 2 Carboxy 3 thienyl methoxyphenyl pentanoic acid A stirred mixture of ethyl 4 4 2 carbomethoxy 3 thienyl methoxyphenyl pentanoate 18.79g, 0.05 mol , potassium hydroxide 28.06g, 0.5 mol , water 30 ml and 95 ethanol 180 ml was refluxed for four hours and then allowed to stand overnight at ambient temperature. The solution was diluted with water and concentrated on a rotary evaporator to remove rttst of the alcohol. Chipped ice was added and the mixture was acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid to afford a suspension.The aqueous phase was decanted and the residue was washed with water to afford a semisolid. A solution of the semisolid and ether 300 ml was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated to afford an oil which crystallized on standing at 50C. The solid was triturated with hexane and isolated by vacuum filtration to give a crude product 15.36g .Reciystallization from acetonitrile 40 ml afforded 13.23g 79.1 of crystals, m.p. 137.5 139.5 C AMLYSIS Calculated for C17H18O5S 61.06 C 5.42 HFound 61.12 C 5.48 H EXAMPLE 14 4 4,10 Dihydro 10 oxothieno 3,2 c 1 benzoxepin 8 yl pentanoic acid A stirred suspension of 4 4 2 carboxy 3 thienyl methoxyphenyl pentanoic acid 10.84g, 0.0324 mol and dichloromethane 100 ml was treated in one portion with trifluoroacetic anhydride 15.88g, 0.0756 mol . On continued stirring over a few minutes the solid dissolved to afford a solution which was heated under reflux for 4 hours. The cooled solution was treated with water and stirred for 20 minutes at ambient temperature.The phases were separated and the organic phase was washed with water, dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated to an oil. A sample of the oil was triturated with toluene to afford a solution which was diluted with hexane whereupon the product separated as an oil which slawly crystallized. Thin layer analysis silica gel, ethyl acetate of the oil indicated t.n impurities with higher Rf values titan the product. A solution of the oil and dichloromethane 100 ml was extracted with 1.3 sodium hydroxide solution 100 ml and the aqueous phase was extracted with a little dichloromethane. The aqueous phase was acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid and extracted with dichloromethane 2X 100 ml .combined, dried Na2SO4 organic phase was concentrated to an oil Aiich a.as cooled, seeded with the crystals obtained above and triturated with hexane to give 7.26g 70.8 of the product as a solid, m.p.83 85 C.ANALYSIS Calculated for C17H16O4S 64.54 C 5.10 HFound 64.59 C 5.16 H
