# Semi conductor power device assembly and method of manufacture thereof.

## Abstract
A heat spreader 12 has a thin ceramic layer 14 plasma sprayed onto its lower surface which may be chamfered. The upper surface of the spreader 12 is then plated with a thin nickel or gold layer 13 and a semi conductor power device 10 is soldered to the latter. The spreader 12 is then secured via the ceramic layer 14 to a base material 15 serving as a heat sink by a layer 16 of epoxy resin loaded with silver particles. The thin ceramic layer electrically insulates the spreader 12 from the base material 15 but enables heal conduction therebe tween. The application of the plasma sprayed ceramic layer 14 to the spreader 12 is easy and economical to effect.
