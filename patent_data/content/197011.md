# INTEGRATED MULTI FUNCTION DIFFERENTIAL SYSTEM

## Abstract
The integrated multi function differential system is de signed to solve the problem of obtaining the difference in speed between two wheels and among the axles. It is composed of several differentials of the same design, the total number of the differentials being equal to the drive axles and of the control system which makes these differen tials work in cooperation. Then there is no need for interaxle differentials, for the system itself can obtain the difference in speed between wheels and among axles. The central rings used as release members in each differential have got two fixed positions related to the driving member, the drive ring, and can be switched by way of the pneumatic control system. The pneumatic control system is actuated together with the positions of the accelerator pedal and the shift of the gear box or it is controlled by the direction of the gear box output torque to meet the requirement of the vehicle driving conditions.
