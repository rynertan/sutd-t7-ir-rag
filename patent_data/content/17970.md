More specifically, it relates to compounds of the formulaEMI1.1 wherein R1 represents a hydrogen atom, a hydroxyl group or a methyl group, R2 represents a lower alkyl group or an aralkyl group, substituted or unsubstituted, having 7 to 20 carbon atoms, and X represents a bromine or iodine atom and to a process for producing these compounds. The compounds of formula I are novel compounds not described in the prior literature. By utilizing the fact that these compounds contain an active bromine or iodine atom at the 3 position, they can be converted to useful compounds having excellent pharmacological activity in which the 3 position is substituted by other groups. The compounds of formula I exhibit superior antimicrobial activities in in vitro tests in the presence of horse serum. In the present specification and the appended claims, the term lower used to qualify groups or compounds means that the groups or compounds so qualified have not more than 6 preferably not more than 4, carbon atoms. The lower alkyl group in formula I may be linear or branched, and includes, for example, methyl, ethyl, n or o propyl, n , iso , sec or tert butyl, and n pentyl. The 1,substituted or unsubstituted aralkyl group containing 7 to 20 carbon atoms in formula I is preferably a lower alkyl group especially methyl or ethyl substituted by 1 to 3 substituted or unsubstituted phenyl groups. Examples of the substituent on the benzene ring in the substituted phenyl group are halogen atoms such as chlorine and bromine, lower alkyl groups such as methyl, lower alkoxy groups such as methoxy, lower haloalkyl groups such as trifluoromethyl, nitro groups, and lower alkyl sulfonyl groups such as methylsulfonyl.

According to this invention, the compounds of formula I can be prepared by reacting compounds of the formulaEMI4.1 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above, and Z represents an amino group or a blocked amino group, with brominating or iodinating agents selected fromN bromimides, N bromamides, N iodimides, N iodamides and alkali metal iodides. The reaction of the compounds of formula II with the halogenating agents can be carried out generally in an organic solvent inert to the reaction, for example halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride or chlorobenzene, under relatively mild conditions, i.e. at a temperature at which the solvent used is maintained liquid, preferably at about 0 to 7000. By this reaction, the N substituted or unsubstituted aminoethylsulfinyl group at the 3 position of the starting compound of formula II is split off, and instead, a bromine or iodine atom is introduced thereinto. Suitable N bromimides and N iodimides used in the aforesaid halogenation reaction are expressed by the following formulaEMI5.1 wherein R3 represents a lower alkylene group, a lower alkenylene group or a phenylene group, and X represents a bromine or iodine atom.Specific examples include N bromosuccinimide, N iodosuccinimide, N bromomaleimide, N iodomaleimide, N bromophthalimide, and N iodophthalimide, Of these, N bromosuccinimide and N iodosuccinimide are preferred. Suitable N bromamides and N iodamides that can be equally used as the halogenating agent are represented by the following formula R 3 C0NHX III b wherein R 3 represents a lower alkyl group or a lower alkylene group, and X represents a bromine or iodine atom. Specific examples include N bromoacetamide, N iodoacetamide, bromopropionamide, N bromoacrylamide, and Nbromo n butyramide. Of these, N bromoacetamide is preferred. Suitable alkali metal iodides are sodium iodide and potassium iodide. The amount of such a halogenating agent is not particularly limited, and can be varied over a wide range depending upon the type of the halogenating agent, and or the type of the starting compound of formula it . Advantageously, it is generally used in an amount of at least 1 mole, preferably about 1.2 to about 2 moles, per mole of the compound of formula 1I . The halogenation reaction proceeds rapidly, and can usually be completed in about 0.5 to about 2 hours under the aforesaid conditions. After the reaction, the resulting compound of formula I can be isolated and purified by various methods known per se. For example, the resulting reaction mixture is diluted with a water immiscible solvent, for example a halogenated hydrocarbon such as methylene chloride, an aromatic hydrocarbon such as benzene or toluene, or an ester such as ethyl acetate, and washed with a phosphate buffer having a pH of 6.8.The solvent layer is dried, and distilled under reduced pressure. The residue is then subjected to gel filtration on a column of Biobead S series a product ofBio Rad Company , and if desired, further to column chromatography on a silica gel column. Alternatively, the resulting reaction mixture is directly subjected to chromatography on a silica gel column. Thus, the compound of formula I can be isolated. The compounds of formula II used as the starting material in the aforesaid halogenation reaction are novel compounds. These compounds can be produced by methods similar to methods for producing known compounds corresponding to formula II in which R1 is a trimethylsilyloxy group, R2 is a trimethylsilyl group and Z is a p nitrobenzyloxycarbonylamino group, and those in which R1 is a hydroxyl group, R2 is a p nitrobenzyl group and Z is a p nitrobenzyloxyzarbonyl amino group see Japanese Laid Open Patent Publication No. 111591 77 and U. S. Patent No. 4,123,547 . For example, the compounds of formula II can be easily prepared by the S oxidation of compounds of the formulaEMI6.1 wherein R1, R2 and Z are as defined hereinabove. The blocked amino group in formulae II and IV above includes, for example, mono or di alkyl or aralkyl amino groups such as methylamino, ethylamino, butylamino, benzylamino, tritylamino, dimethylamino, diethylamino, dibutylamino and dibenzylamino mono or di trialkyl silylamino groups such as trimethylsilylamino and ditrimethylsilylamino acylamide groups such as formamide, acetamide, propionamide, butyrylamide, phenylacetamide, chloroacetamide, trifluoroacetamide, o nitrophenoxyacetamide, methoxyacetamide, mesylamide, and tosylamide and alkoxy carbonylamino groups such as methoxycarbonylamino, ethoxycarbonylamino, butoxycarbonylamino, benzyloxycarbonylamino, nitrobenzyloxycarbonylamino and methoxybenzylcarbonylamino. The S oxidation of the compounds of formula IV can be carried out by methods known per se, for example methods frequently used in the S oxidation of sulfur containing ss lactam antibiotics of the penicillin type, the cephalosporin type, etc. For example, the compound of formula IV is reacted with a mild oxidizing agent which does not substantially act on the ss lactam skeleton, for example perbenzoic acid, phenyldichloroiodide, or sodium metaperiodate. Suitable mild oxidizing agents are organic per acids, especially perbenzoic acid and m chloro perbenzoic acid. Substituted perbenzoic acids, such as m chloro perbenzoic acid, are preferred. Advantageously, the reaction of the compound of formula IV with the oxidizing agent is carried out usually in an inert solvent such as methylene chloride, chloroform or carbon tetrachloride under mild temperature conditions, for example at room temperature or below, preferably at about 30 C to about 20 C. The reaction can be completed usually in 3 minutes to 3 hours under these conditions. The amount of the oxidizing agent used in theS oxidation of the compound of formula IV can be varied widely according to the type of the oxidizing agent, the reaction conditions, etc. Generally, the suitable amount of the oxidizing agent is 0.3 to 1.8 molar ecduivalents, preferably 0.7 to 1.3 molar esui valents, per mole of the compound of formula IV . The resulting compound of formula 11 can be isolated and purified by methods known per se. Or it can be submitted to the aforesaid halogenation reaction immediately after the excess unreacted oxidizing agent remaining in the reaction mixture is decomposed or removed. Most of the compounds of formula IV are known.Compounds of formula IV in which R1 is a hydrogen atom and Z is an acetylamino group antibiotic PS 5 and its esters and a method for the production thereof are disclosed, for example, in J. Antibiotics, 31, 480 482 1978 , and German Offenlegungsschrift DE OS Limo. 2813922. Compounds of formula IV in which R1 is a hydroxyl group, and a method for production thereof are disclosed, for example, in DE OS No. 2652680 andDE OS No. 2652674. Furthermore, compounds of formula IV in which R1 is a methyl group and Z is an acetylamino group and a method for production thereof are disclosed, for example, in European Patent Application,Published Specification No. 1567. The compounds of formula IV in which R1 is a methyl group are novel antibiotics which the present inventors discovered previously and named antibioticsPS 6 . These substances are produced by using an antibiotic PS 6 producing microorganism separated, for example, from the soil. Strepto yces sp. A271 ATCC 31358 is a typical example of such a microorganism. The microbiological properties of Streptomyces sp. A271, the fermentative method for producing antibiotic PS 6, the method for its purification, the method for its esterification, etc. are disclosed in the aforesaidEuropean Patent Application, Published SpecificationNo. 1567 which the present inventors previously filed. The specification of the aforesaid European Patent is hereby cited in lieu of describing its contents in the present application, but specific examples are given hereinbelow. The compounds of formula I provided by this invention have been found to have a unique property in that when a highly active bromine or iodine atom at their 3 position makes contact with a nucleophilic reagent such as a thiol compound, a group exchange reaction very easily takes place to produce derivatives in which the 3 position is replaced by another group. The compounds of formula I are industrially very useful compounds as intermediates for conversion to valuable derivatives corresponding to formula I in which the 3 position is replaced by another group. For example,.the compounds of formula I can be converted to compounds of the formulaEMI9.1 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined hereinabove, and R4 is a lower alkyl group, a hydroxy lower alkyl group, a lower alkoxy lower alkyl group, a di lower alkyl amino lower alkyl group, a lower alkanoyloxy lower alkyl group, a benzoyl amino lower alkyl group, a cyclohexyl group, a phenyl group, or a 5 or 6 membered aromatic heterocyclic group having 1 or 2 nitrogen atoms, by reacting them with thiol compounds of the formula R4 SH v wherein R4 is as defined above, or the reactive derivatives thereof. Saponification or hydrogenolysis of the resulting compounds gives compounds of the following formula EMI10.1 wherein R1 and R4 are as defined above, or the salts thereof, which have antimicrobial activities. Advantageously, the reaction of the compound of formula I with the thiol compound of formula V is carried out usually.in a solvent such as N,N dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, hexamethylphosphoric triamide or glyme, particularly in dimethylformamide, at low temperatures, for example about 60 C to 30 C, preferably 500C to 300C. Under these conditions, the reaction can usually be completed in 20 minutes to 40 hours. When the thiol compound of formula V is used, the reaction sometimes proceeds even in the absence of a base as a catalyst. Generally, it is desirable to perform the reaction in the presence of bases. Usable bases include, for example, amines such as triethylamine, alkali metal hydrides such as sodium hydride and potassium hydride, alkali metal amldes such as sodium amide and potassium amide, alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, and alkali metal alkoxides such as sodium ethoxide, sodium methoxide and potassium butoxide.Advantageously, the bases are used in a proportion of at least 0.9 equivalent, preferably 1.0 to 1.2 equivalents, per mole of the thiol compound. Instead of performing the aforesaid reaction in the presence of bases, a reactive derivative of the thiol compound of formula V may be used. Typical examples of such reactive derivatives include sodium ethanethiolate, sodium butanethiolate, potassium ethanethiolate, potassium butanethiolate, sodium cyclohexanethiolate, sodium phenylthiolate, sodium dimethylaminoethanethiolate, sodium hydroxyethanethiolate, sodium phenylacetamidoethanethiolate, sodium 4 pyridinethiolate, sodium 2 pyridinethiolate and sodium 2pyrimidinethiolate. The amount of the thiol compound of formula V or its reactive derivative is not critical.Generally, it is advantageously used in an amount of at least 1.0 mole, preferably 1.1 to 1.5 moles, per mole of the compound of formula I . Thus, the compound of formula VI a is obtained.As required, this compound is purified, and then saponified or hydrogenolyzed to split off the group R2. As a result, it can be converted to the compound of formula VI b or its salt. Hydrogenolysis of the compound of formula VI a can be performed by methods known per se. For example, it can be performed by treating the compound VI a with hydrogen in a solvent such as water or an ether e.g., dioxane or tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a catalyst such as platinum oxide, palladium carbon or palladium black in combination with a buffer having a pK of at least 7. The resulting compound of formula VI b can be isolated and purified in accordance with various methods known per e. Usually, the compound can be isolated from the reaction mixture by methods frequently used in isolating and purifying carboxylic acid type antibiotics. For example, solids are removed by filtration from the reaction mixture after the reaction.A buffer such as a phosphate buffer is added to the filtrate While the pH of the filtrate is maintained so that it is not shifted to an acidic side, the filtrate is subjected to the following procedures either singly or in combination with each other, and if required, repeatedly. These procedures include, for example, a combination of adsorption on activated carbon, AmberliteXAD 2 a product of Rahm Hazes Co. , Diaion HP 20 a product of Mitsubishi Chemical Co., Stud. , etc. and elution with methanol water, acetone water, etc. adsorption and elution by ion exchange resins such asDowex 1X2 a product of Dow Chemical Co. , Dowex 50X2 a product of Dow Chemical Co. and QAE Sephadex A 25 a product of Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Co. gel filtraction on Sephadex G 10 a product of Pharmacia FineChemicals Co. , Bioel P 2 a product of Bio Rad Co. , etc. column or thin layer chromatography on cellulose,Avicel SF a product of American Viscose Corporation , DEAE Cellulose Watman DE 32 a product of Watman Co. ,DEAE Sephadex A 25 a product of Pharmacia Fine ChemicalsCo. , silica, alumina, etc. forced precipitation by addition of a solvent such as acetone and lyophilization. According to the process of this invention, in the course of obtaining the final product from the starting compound via the reaction intermediate, the reaction can be allowed to proceed without affecting the stereochemistry of each of these compounds. It has been found that when compounds of formula IV in which R1 is a hydrogen atom or a methyl group are produced by the fermentative method described in the above cited known references, they have a 5,6 trans configuration. Thus, compounds of formulae I , II , VI a and VI b in which R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group obtained by the present invention from such starting materials can assume a 5,6 trans configuration. On the other hand, compounds of formula IV in which R1 represents a hydroxyl group can be obtained as epimers of either the 5,6 trans or 5,6 cisconfiguration by the methods described in the abovecited references. They can also be obtained as isomers ascribable to the asymmetric carbon at the 8 position of these epimers.Accordingly, when R1 represents a hydroxyl group, the compounds of formulae I , II , VI a and VI b may exist as epimers attributed to the asymmetric carbon at the 8 position of the compounds of the 5,6 trans or 5,6 cis configuration. The compound of formula VI b obtained by the method described hereinabove can be converted to a salt by a conventional method, for example by treating it with an inorganic base such as sodium bicarbonate, disodium phosphate, dipotassium phosphate, potassium 2 ethylhexanoate or ammonia, or an organic base such as monoethylamine, dimethylamine, triethylamine, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, benzathine or procaine. The compounds of formula VI b or their salts have superior antibacterial activities. Typical species of the compounds of formula VI b and their salts have antibiotic activities as shown inTables 1 1 to I 8 below. Table I 9 shows the antibiotic activities of known compounds.

The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the compounds of formula VI b in Tables 1 1 to I 8 and the known compounds in Table I 9 on the various microorganisms shown in the above tables were measured by an agar dilution assay method using a brain heart infusion agar medium Difco a product of Difco LaboratoriesInc. . A sample of the test compound was dissolved in sterile distilled water and diluted to prepare a twofold dilution series of the compound solution. In aBetri dish of 9 cm in diameter, 1 ml of the compound solution was added to 9 ml of a molten sterile heart infusion agar medium Difco Laboratories Inc. at about 60 C to prepare an agar plate containing the compound.An overnight culture of each test organism indicated in the above table, which was prepared by stationary cultivation in trypto soy broth Eiken Chemi. Co.,Ltd. at 350C for 18 to 20 hours, was diluted with the trypto soy broth to give approximately 108 cells ml and the diluted inoculum was inoculated in the agar plate. After cultivating the plate at 350C for 20 hours, the growth of the organism was observed. The minimum concentration of the compound at which no growth of the microorganism was noted was determined, and defined as the minimum inhibitory concentration of the test compound. Typical specie of the compounds of formula VI b were each administered subcutaneously to five mice in a dose of 2 mg. After 5 minutes from the administration, a small amount of blood was periodically drawn from the eyes of the mice into a heparinized capillary tube, and centrifuged. The concentration of the compound in the supernatant liquid plasma was determined by a bioassay method using Comamonas terrigena B 996.

The compounds of formula VI b tested were well absorbed, and gave considerably high maximum concern trations. In particular, compounds of formula VI b in which R2 is an aromatic heterocyclic group have a superior mazimum concentration. Compounds of formula VI b in which the S side chain at the 3 position has a phenyl group i.e., R2 phenyl have a long half period and thus maintained a high blood level over a long period of time. The in vivo activities of the compounds of formula VI b were determined by using mice five per group, male DDY mice, Shizuoka which had been intraperitoneally infected with Staphylococcus aureus Smith strain in an amount of 5 x 105 cells per mouse.
