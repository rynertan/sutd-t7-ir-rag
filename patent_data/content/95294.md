The reaction is suitably carried out in an anhydrous organic solvent in the presence of a base, preferably at depressed or room temperature, and the product purified chromato graphically by, for example, column chromatography on silica gel. Examples of suitable solvent systems for carrying out the reaction are anhydrous pyridine, tetrahydrofuran sodium carbonate, and tetrahydrofuran triethylamine. The reaction will generally produce a mixture of products wherein both of R1 and R2 are alkoxy , alkenyloxy , phenoxy or phenylalkoxy carbonyl groups, and each of R1 and R2 is a hydrogen atom while the other is alkoxy , alkenyloxy , phenoxy or phenylalkoxy carbonyl. The mixture can be separated into its pure components by chromatographic methods.The relative amounts of products will depend on the relative amounts of reactants, the physical conditions of the reaction, and the solvent system. For example, an excess of chloroformate will produce more of the disubstituted compound in the final mixture. Compounds of formula I wherein R3 is alkoxy , alkenyloxy , phenoxy or phenylalkoxy carbonyl as defined above, and R1 and R2 are each hydrogen atoms, may be prepared by treating a compound of formula IV EMI7.1 wherein Y is as defined in formula I , and Q1 and Q2 are O protecting groups, with the appropriate alkyl, alkenyl, phenyl or phenylalkyl chloroformate, and deprotecting the resultant product. Suitable O protecting groups are trialkylsilyl groups, such as trimethylsilyl. The reaction is suitably carried out in an anhydrous organic solvent in the presence of a base, preferably at room temperature, and the product may be purified by column chromatography on silica gel. The compound of formula IV may be prepared by treating a compound of formula III as defined above, with a silylating agent. Suitable silylating agents include halosilanes or silazanes of the formulae L3 Si U L3 Si NL2 L3 Si NH Si L3 L3 Si.NH.COL L3 Si.NH.CO.NH.Si L3 L NH.CO.NH.Si L3 L3 Si N CLO Si L3.wherein U is a halogen and the various groups L which may be the same or different, each represents hydrogen or alkyl, aryl or aralkyl. A preferred silylating agent is N,O bistrimethylsilylacetamide, and the silylation reaction is preferably carried out in an anhydrous organic solvent, suitably tetrahydrofuran, at room temperature. The product may be purified chromatographically by, for example, column chromatography on silica gel. The protected compound of formula IV , wherein Q is replaced by a hydrogen atom, may also be used to prepare compounds of formula I , wherein R2 is alkoxy , alkenyloxy , phenoxy or phenylalkoxy carbonyl and R1 and R3 are each hydrogen atoms, by treatment with an alkyl , alkenyl , phenyl or phenylalkylchloroformate and deprotecting the resultant product.The reaction conditions are similar to those described above. Compounds of formula I wherein R1, R2 or R3 is an acyl group as defined, may be prepared by treating the compounds of formula I wherein R1, R2 or R3 is a hydrogen atom, with an acylating agent containing theEMI9.1 group orEMI9.2 group, whereinX and Z are as defined with respect to formula I . A preferred acylating agent is an acid anhydride of formulaEMI9.3 or an acid chloride of formulaEMI9.4 The reaction is conveniently carried out in an anhydrous organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran in the presence of a base or pyridine, and the product purified by column chromatography on silica gel. In the case where, in the reactant of formula I ,R1 is alkoxy , alkenyloxy , phenoxy or phenylalkoxy carbonyl, and R2 and R3 are both hydrogen atoms, the reaction will generally produce a mixture of three products, wherein each one of the two hydrogen atoms is replaced by an acyl group while the other hydrogen atom remain intact, and wherein both hydrogen atoms are replaced by acyl groups. The mixture can be separated into its pure components by chromatographic methods. In order to prepare compounds of formula I wherein two of R1, R2 and R3 are different acyl groups, the mono acylated compounds prepared as described above may be isolated from the three product mixture and further treated with a different acylating agent under similar reaction conditions. In this way, any combination of acylated derivatives may be prepared, as required. Certain compounds of formula I can themselves be converted to other compounds of formula I . For example, compounds of formula I in which R1 is optionally substituted phenoxycarbonyl may be converted into compounds wherein R1 is C1 12 alkoxycarbonyl by treatment with a C1 12 alkanol, preferably in the presence of a basic organic solvent such as pyridine. In a similar manner, treatment with a C2 12 diol, in place of the C1 12 alkanol, will yield a compound of formula I wherein R1 is hydroxy substituted C2 12 alkoxycarbonyl. Phosphate esters of the compounds of formula I may be prepared by treating a compound of formula I , in which R1 or R2 is hydrogen, with phosphoryl chloride, preferably in an anhydrous basic organic solvent such as pyridine. The ester can be suitably prepared in the form of an alkali metal salt by the addition of an alkali metal bicarbonate to the ester. The compounds of formula I or salts or esters thereof may be formulated for use in a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly, in a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Compositions which may be administered by the oral route to humans may be compounded in the form of syrups, tablets and capsules. When the composition is in the form of a tablet, any pharmaceutical carrier suitable for formulating such solid compositions may be used, for example magnesium stearate, starch, lactose, glucose, rice, flour and chalk. The composition may also be in the form of an ingestible capsule, for example of gelatin, to contain the compound, or in the form of a syrup, a solution or a suspension. Suitable liquid pharmaceutical carriers include ethyl alcohol, glycerine, saline and water to which flavouring or colouring agents may be added to form syrups. The compounds may also be presented with a sterile liquid carrier for injection. The composition may also be formulated for topical application to the skin or eyes. For topical application to the skin, the compounds of the invention may be made up into a cream, lotion or ointment. These formulations may be conventional formulations well known in the art, for example, as described in standard books of pharmaceutics and cosmetics, such as Harry s Cosmeticology published byLeonard Hill Books and the British Pharmacopaeia. The composition for application to the eyes may be a conventional eye drop composition well known in the art. Preferably, the compositions of this invention are in unit dosage form or in some other form that the patient may administer to himself a single dose. A suitable dosage unit might contain from 50 mg to 1 g of active ingredient, for example 100 to 500 mg. Such doses may be administered 1 to 4 times a day or more usually 2 or 3 times a day. The effective dose of compound depends on the particular compound employed, but is in general in the range of from 1.0 to 20 mg kg of body weight per day or more usually 2.0 to 10 mg kg per day. In a further aspect of the invention there is provided a method of treating viral infections in human and non human animals, which comprises administering to the sufferer an effective amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof.

The cells were infected with Herpes simplex type 1 virus HFEM strain and overlaid with 0.5ml of 0.98 agarose w v in maintenance medium. Test compounds prepared in maintenance medium in concentrations ranging from 100 to 0.03pg ml in half log dilution steps, were added in 0.5ml volume. The virus infected cultures were then incubated at 37 for 4 days before fixing in 4 formaldehyde solution and staining with carbolfuchsin.The dishes were then examined to find what concentration of test compound caused a 50 reduction in the number of virus plaques formed PDD50 value and the minimum concentration of test compound which caused cytotoxicity MTD .
