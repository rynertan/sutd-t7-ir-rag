# Tiddly wink.

## Abstract
A tiddly wink configured to include a pair of planar members, each having an arcuate periphery which are interconnected by a thin flexible shaft at the center of each member. The device is preferably integrally molded from synthetic resinous material having a desired degree of resiliency. An outer surface of one of the planar members may have a roughened configuration to permit play on any type of surface. The tiddly wink is used by imparting force to one of the planar members causing the shaft upon bending to store potential energy which is released with the parting of contact by the player.

## Description
TIDDLY WINK BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates generally to the field of playing pieces for board games and the like, and more particularly to an improved tiddly wink offering superior performance and range to a skilled user. Traditionally, tiddly winks have been made as coin shaped pieces of wood or synthetic resinous materials, the annular edges of which are transversely curved to provide a camming surface so that when a similar piece is drawn over the edge of the first piece, the first piece is propelled in a desired general direction to impinge upon a target or collecting recess. Because of the downward pressure exerted upon the first piece during play, it normally moves with a vertically directed component of motion. Because of the rigidity of the material, the amount of potential energy which can be stored in the first piece is limited, and, as a consequence, only limited movement is therefore to be expected. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Briefly stated, the invention contemplates the provision of an improved playing piece of the type described in which the single planar member is replaced by a pair of generally similar planar circular members interconnected by an axially positioned slender shaft possessed of substantial flexibility. The piece is propelled by contact with the uppermost of the planar members while resting on the lowermost planar member which is in contact with a planar supporting surface. The other planar surface is recessed, providing an annular upstanding edge for engagement by the players finger. The flat recessed portion is preferably roughened to provide for better engagement with the player s finger. The dimensions of the piece form part of the invention. It has been found that the preferred ratio of the diameter of the planar members to their spacing is 2 to 1.The preferred diameter of the planar members is 1 inch 2.54 cm . The shaft is as thin as possible, preferably t 8th inch 0.32 cm . Other dimensions and tolerances also form part of the invention. Downward pressure will cause the shaft to bend and thus store potential energy which is released when the upper planar member is free of contact with the player. Depending upon the particular angle of the upper planar member with respect to the lower planar member, it is possible for a skilled player to control the planar motion of the moving piece by inducing both linear and rotational components destined to transport the moving piece to an intended target. If desired, one exposed planar surface of the piece may be textured or roughed for use on varying surfaces. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING In the drawing, to which reference will be made in the specification, similar reference characters have been employed to designate corresponding parts throughout the several views. Figure 1 is a side elevational view of a playing piece embodying the invention. Figure 2 is a longitudinal sectional view thereof. Figure 3 is a top plan view thereof. Figure 4 is a bottom plan view thereof. Figure 5 is a perspective view showing the playing of the piece. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSED EMBODIMENT In accordance with the invention, the device, generally indicated by reference character 10, comprises broadly a first or upper member 11, a second or lower member 12, and an interconnecting shaft 13. The member 11 is bounded by a relatively flat recessed surface 15, and a beaded edge 16 formed by a cam surface 17.An inner surface 18 has a corresponding surface 19 which merges with the surface 17 to form an edge 16. The second member 12 is generally similar, and includes a relatively textured outer surface 20, a beaded edge 21, a cam surface 22, an inner surface 23, and a cam surface 24. The members 11 and 12 preferably have a diameter of 1 inch plus or minus 1 8th inch 2.54 cm plus or minus 0.32 cm . Said members 11 and 12 are 1 32nd to 3 32nd inches .08 cm to 0.24 cm thick, preferably 0.15875 cm . The relative distance between members 11 and 12, separated by shaft 13, is i inch plus or minus 1 8th inch 1.27 cm plus or minus 0.32 cm . That is, the ratio of the diameter of member 11 and 12 to their spacing is preferably 2 to 1. The shaft 13 has a diameter of 1 16th to 3 16th inches 0.16 cm to 0.48 cm and preferably 1 8th inch o.3175 cm when the material of the unitary device is low durometer polyvinyl chloride the preferred material. It is desirable that the shaft be as thin as the material will allow. The piece has the overall following dimensions while the planar member 12 rests on a planar supporting surface Height 5 8 inches not less than inch 1.27 cm and not greater than 7 8 inches 2.22 cm . Preferably 5 8 inches 1.5875 cm . Figure 5 shows a device 10 in position for play in the traditional manner. Instead of using a second piece to impart motion, the finger of the player is used to apply pressure upoh one edge of the upper planar member 18, wherein the shaft 13 is bent about an axis perpendicular to its own principal axis. As the finger parts contact with the upper planar member, the shaft resiliently returns to its original straight condition, releasing stored potential energy and imparting a spin to the device which will include both rotational and translational components.Normally, the rotational component will be greater, although, by careful manipulation, it is possible to vary the proportions by the manner in which the device is released by the player. An upstanding annular bead 34 surrounds the surface 15 and aids the player s grip. The surface 15 is preferably mildly roughed or pebbled to aid the player s grip. The bottom surface 20 is preferably heavily textured to form a plurality of small area surfaces 36 forming its outer plane. These aid in operating the device on any surface. They are preferably spherical bumps as shown, but also may be formed by relatively heavy diamond knurling or coining. The bottom surface 20 is preferably surrounded by an annular bead 38, the outer surface of which lies in the outer plane of the surface 36.Bead 38 allows the piece to be used upside down. I wish it to be understood that I do not consider the invention limited to the precise details of structure shown and set forth in this specification, for obvious modifications will occur to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains.
