# Ultrasonic pulse Doppler blood flow meter.

## Abstract
In an ultrasonic pulse Doppler blood flow meter an amplitude equalizing circuit 20 is provided between a high pass filter 8,9 , which follows a Doppler detector 6 , and a Doppler analyzer 10 . The amplitude equalizing circuit 20 enables the dynamic input range of the analyzer 10 to be effectively utilized and provides automatic adjustment of the cut frequency of the high pass filter 8,9 in accordance with input signal conditions.
