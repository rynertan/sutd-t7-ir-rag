# POLYMERIZATION METHOD UTILIZING A THREE PHASE EMULSION SYSTEM

## Abstract
Polymerization method utilizing a three phase system water in oil in water or oil in water in oil comprising the steps a adding the monomer material to be polymerized into the innermost water or oil phase b adding, with mechanical agitation, the product of Step a to the middle oil or water phase, said phase containing appropriate surfac tant, whereby an emulsion is formed c adding, with me chanical agitation, the emulsion product of Step b to the outermost water or oil phase, said phase containing appro priate surfactant, wherein polymerization proceeds in the innermost water or oil phase until complete.
