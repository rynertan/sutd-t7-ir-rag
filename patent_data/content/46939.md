# VISIBLE LIGHT SOURCE APPARATUS FOR CURING PHOTO CURABLE COMPOSITIONS

## Abstract
There is provided a device for efficient production of light in the low visible range for photo curing materials, the device being particularly adapted for dental applications. The efficient light source comprises a tungsten halogen lamp 45 with a concentrating reflector which reflects visible light and passes middle and far infrared wavelengths. A filter system 50, 51 is provided comprising a dichroic heat reflecting filter 50 which efficiently passes light from 400 to 700 nm and reflects energy in the visible red and near infrared wavelengths back to the lamp envelope, thus enhancing lamp halogen cycle efficiency. The dichroic heat reflecting filter is followed by a dielectric filter 51 which provides a high efficiency bandpass at the desired visible range. A highly efficient fiber optic light guide 55 is positioned to receive the focused and filtered light and to transmit it to a reduced surface light applying tip 58 at the end of a handpiece 75. The fiber light guide 55 is encased in a specially designed sheathing which provides protection to the optical fibers and carriers two electrical conductors 64 which are connected between a control switch 78 on the handpiece 75 and the power supply for the lamp 45.
