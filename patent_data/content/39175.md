# Electrical connecting assembly for circuit cards.

## Abstract
The assembly comprises circuit cards 14, 26 and 26 between which are insulating modules 30 having rows of terminals 32 extending through internally metalically plated holes 46 and 46 in the cards 14, 26 and 26 . For the conser vation of space on the circuit boards 14, 26 and 26 the modules 30 are arranged in overlapping relationship, the terminals 32 of one row of terminals 32 of each module 30 extending into an opening 42 in the other module 30 . The modules 30 are spaced back from the edges 50 and 50 of the cards 14, 26 and 26 so that these edges 50 and 50 can be inserted into circuit card edge connectors not shown .
