## Description
Tricyclic chemical compounds and their production This invention relates to prostaglandin antagonists.Prostaglandin antagonists are useful in treating a variety of conditions, such as allergic asthma where excessive contractile activity of prostaglandins and prostaglandin biosynthetic intermediates occur. The prostaglandin antagonists of the present invention are 7 and 8 substituted dibenzo b,f thiepins having the structural formula EMI1.1 in which n is Q or an integer from 1 to 4 Z is thio, sulfinyl, or sulfonyly R is hydrogen, halogen including chlorine, bromine, fluorine and iodine, amino, C1 4 alkyl, C1 4 alkanoyl, kydroxyl, C34 alkoxy, mercapto, C1 4 alirylthio, C1 4 alkylsulfilryl, C1 4 alkylsulfonyl, trif uorotnethyl, trifluoromet,hyltbio, cyano, carbon nitro, C1 4 alkylamino or di C1 4alkyl amino A is 5 tetrazolel, 3 hydror 1,2,5 thiadiazol 4 yl, 4 hydrox 2,5 dioxo 83 pfrrolin S yi or EMI2.1 where R2 is hydroxy, C1 4 alkoxy , N,N 2i Cl Ealtyl amino Cl 4 alkoxy , C1 4 hydroxyalk Xrç carboxy Cl 4 alkoxy , amino, C1,4 alkylamino, ditCl 4 alkyl amino, C1 4 alkylsulfonylamino, carboxy Cl 4 alkyl amino, carbamoyl C1 4 alkyl amino or 2 imino3 methylthiazolioine and the dotted line indicates either an olefinic bond or saturation at the 10 , ll position and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. As used herein, the term, halogen or halo , means chlorine, bromine, iodine or fluorine. Unless otherwise specifically stated, the term lower alkyl and loweralkoxy means straight and branched chain alkyl and alkoxy groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl or alkoxy residue, for example, methyl, ethyl, n propyl, isopropyl, n butyl, methoxy, ethoxy, n propoxy and isobutoxy. The term loweralkanoyl includes straight or branched chain alkanoyl groups having 1 to 4 carbon atoms in the alkanoyl residue, for example, formyl, acetyl, propanoyl, isobutyryl and isotutyryl. These dibenzo b,fà thiepin desivatives antag onize the actions of contractile prostaglandins, such as PGG2 d and PGH2 and TXA,. The use of agents which act as prostaglandin antagonists offers new approaches to therapy in a a number of disease states. For example, certain prostaglandins, such as PGF2z, PGG2 and PGEI2, are potent contractants of bronchial muscle. Indeed human asthmatics have been shown to be especially sensitive to the bronchial constricting action of PGF2aS In addition to the involvement of contrac tile prostaglandins in chronoc obstructive lung disease or asthma , prostaglandins are know to play a role in other allergic conditions, as well as inflammation, diarrhea, hypertension, angina, platelet aggregation, cerebral spasm, premature abortion, and dismenonorrhea. In addition to the prostaglandin antagonist actions, the dibcnzotb,flthiepins of this invention are antagonists of sl reacting substance of anaphylaxis SRS A . This contractile substance is released in the lung tissue in allergic asthma, and antagoninm of its actions contributes to alleviation of this disease. The dibenzo b,f thiepins of this invention are prepared according to the follving general reaction scheme. An appropriately substituted mercaptobenzoic acid II is is reacted with sr dibromobenzene III R3 Br to obtain the 0 3 bromophenyl benzoic acid ZV. Or Alter natively, an approrriately substituted o bromobenzoic acid II R2 lNr is reacted with m bromobenzenethiol III to SH to give 1V, EMI3.1 where RÚ is hydrogen, nitro, amino, C14 alkanoyl, hydroxy C14 alkoxy, C14 alkyisulfinyl, C1 4 alkylsulfonyl, C1 4 alkyl, trifluoromethyl or trifluoromethyithic. R2 and 5 are different one of them is mercapto and the other ifi bromine. Generally, the sulfide forming reaction is carried out according to the methods described by Jilek et al., Mbnatsh. Chem. 96, 200 1965 , Protiva et al,Czech. Patent 121,337 C.A. 68 105, 247t, 1968 andU.S.P. 3,711,489, and by other procedures well known in the art. The resulting o 3 bromophenylthio benzoic acid IV is reduced to the alcohol, brominated, and the bromo replaced with cyano. The cyano derivative is then hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid V.EMI4.1 The carboxylic acid V is transformed into the 3 bromo Il oxo l0,11 dihydrodibenzoIb,flthiepin by first conversion to the acid halide with thionyl or phosphoryl halide followed by Friedel Crafts cyclization with a Lexis acid such as aluminum chloride to give VI. Reduction of the ketone VI with alkali metal borohydrides, followed by heating with catalytic amounts of a mineral acid, such as sulfuric acid or toluenesulfonic acid provides the 3 bromodibenzolS,flthiepin VII. EMI5.1 The 3 bromo derivative VII is then converted to the 3 nitrile YIII by reaction with cuprous cyanide in a high boiling polar solvent such as dimethylformamide, N methylpyrrolidone and the like.EMI5.2 The 3 cyano derivative YI1I may be hydrolyzed with agueous mineral acid or base to give the dibenzo b,f thiepin 3 carboxylic acid ZX. The 3 cyano compound VII1 may also be reacted with azide ion at reflux in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide, hexa methylphosphorictriamide and the like for 1 4 to8 hours to give the tetrazole derivative X. Alternatively, the cyano intermediate VIII may be oxidized with organic peroxides such as peroxy acids, for example, m chloroperbenzoic acid and the like, in a stepwise fashion to the corresponding sulfoxide XI and sulfone XII, controlling the molar ratio of oxidant to reductant. This determines the oxidation level of the sulfur. For example, a 1 1 molar ratio re sults largely in the production of sulfoxide XI. In contrast, a 2 to 3 molar excess of oxidant results in a yield predominantly comprising the sulfone XII.EMI6.1 Hydrolysis of XI and XII using aqueous mineral acid or alkali provides the corresponding carboxylic acids RII and XIV. EMI6.2 Reaction of XI and XII with azide ion as described above provides the tetrazoles XV and XVI, respectively.EMI7.1 Compounds of type I where the 10 11 double bond is saturated are prepared from intermediate V in which the 3 bromo is converted to a cyano derivative XVII, then hydrolyzed with mineral acid to the acid XVIII and esterified to the ester XIX, where R is loweralkyl.EMI7.2 The ester XIX is reduced by conventional methods, e.g., Wolff xishner, to compound XXII os better by reduction with N6E4 to XX followed by PBr3 reacton to XXI, then reduction with NaBH3 in solvent such as sulfolane to XXII.EMI8.1 Compound XXII may be hydrolyzed with aqueous mineral acid or base to give the l0, lI dihydro b,f thiepin 3 carboxylic acid XXIII. Compound XXII may also be oxidized with one equivalent of organic peroxides, such as peroxy acids, for example, m chloro perbenzoic acid and the like, to yield the sulfoxideXXIV, which can then be hydrolyzed with mineral acid or base to provide the carboxylic acid XXV. EMI9.1 The acid XXIII may be oxidized with excess organic peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide in acidic solvents such as acetic acid at temperatures ranging from 00 1000C. to yield compound XXVI. EMI9.2 Compound VI may be reacted with phosphorous tribromide followed by reduction with NaBH4 in solvents, such as sulfolane, and reaction with cuprous cyanide in high boiling polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide, N methylpyrrolidone and the like, to yield XXVII. EMI10.1 The 3 cyano derivative XXVII may be reacted with azide ion at reflux in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide or in THF with the addition of Lewis acid, such as Aid3, to yield the tetrazole derivative XXVIII. Compound XXVII can also be oxidized with excess peroxy acid, such as m chloroperbenzoic acid followed by the tetrazole forming reaction to yield XXIX.EMI10.2 Tetrazole XXVIII may be oxidized with perox id such as hydrogen peroxide in acidic medium, such as acetic acid, to yield compound XXX.EMI11.1 XVII may also be oxidized with one equivalent of organic peroxide, such as peroxy acids, for example, m chloroperbenzoic acid followed by mineral acid or base hydrolysis to yield XXXI.EMI11.2 XVII can also be reacted with azide ion at reflux in an inert solvent such as dimethylformamide or in THF with the addition of a Lewis acid such asAlp13 to yield the tetrazole XXXII. EMI12.1 Substituent R in I can also be introduced by modification of the nitro group in VIII R NO2 and XXVII R N02 by known procedures. For example,XXXIII can be reduced with stannous chloride in acidic medium, hydrochloric acid and the like, to yield XXXIV which can be hydrolyzed with mineral acids or bases to XXXV.EMI12.2 Alternatively, XXXIII may be oxidized with peroxides, for example, m chloroperbenzoic acid to yield XXXVI which can be reduced to XXXVII and then hydrolysed with mineral acids or bases to XXXVIII.EMI13.1 Intermediate XXXIV can be reacted with sodium nitrite in mineral acid to the diazonium salt XXXIX, where X is a mineral acid counter ion, for example, C1, HSO BF4 and the like1 which on reaction with CuCl and CuC12 yields intermediate XL which can be hydrolyzed to the acid XLI. Intermediate XL may also be oxidized to the sulfone derivative, then followed by a hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid XLII. EMI14.1 Derivative XXXIX can be hydrolyzed with a solution of sulfuric acid 10 to 508 in strength at temperatures ranging from 00 900C. to yield XLIII. XXXIX may also be reacted with potassium thioxanthate at temperatures from 400 700C. followed by basic hydrolysis to yield the thiol acid XLIV. EMI15.1 Compound XXXVII can be transformed in the usual manner to the diazonium salt XLV. XLV can be reacted as described above to yield compounds XLVIAND XLVII.EMI15.2 Compounds XLIII, XLIV, XLVI, XLVII can be reacted with alkyl halides RX in which R is a lower alkyl C1 to C4, benzyl, and X is a leaving group such as C1, Br, I,EMI16.1 in the presence of bases such as alkali carbonate, hydroxides, and the like, in solvents such as dimethylformamide, at temperatures ranging from 3O0 1600C. to yield XLVIII, XLIX, L and LI, respectively.EMI16.2 Compound XLIX can in a controlled oxidation with peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide or organic peroxy acids such as m chloroperbenzoic acid, yield compound LII. LI may be oxidized with one equivalent of organic peroxides such as m chloroperbenzoic acid or with hydrogen peroxide in hydroxylic solvents such as alcohols, organic acids such as acetic acid, at temperatures below 300C., to yield LIII. CompoundsXLIX, LI and LIII may also be oxidized with excess organic peroxides such as m chloroperbenzoic acid at room temperature, or with peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide in acidic medium such as acetic acid at temperatures between 800 and 1000 C. to yield LIV.EMI17.1 Specific introduction of substituents in position 8 inI can also be achieved. For example, XXVII can react with alkanoyl halide RCOX or alkanoic anhydride RCOOCOR in which R is a lower alkyl C1 to C4 and X is chloro or bromo, to yield the substituted acyl LV which upon acid or base hydrolysis affords acid LVI.EMI18.1 EMI18.2 LV can be oxidized with oxidizing agents such as inchloro perbenzoic acid stepwise to yield sulfoxideLVII and sulfone LVIII which are hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions to afford acids LIX andLX respectively. EMI19.1 Compound LVI can be reacted with hydroxylamine hydro chloride with presence of base to yield oxime LXI which on a Beckman rearrangement, yields the acylamino compound LXII which upon hydrolysis yields amino.acidLXIII.EMI19.2 compound LXII can be oxidizedwith hydrogen peroxide in acetic acid stepwise to yield the corresponding sulfoxide LXIV and sulfone LXV which upon hydrolysis afford the acids LXVI and LXVII.EMI20.1 Compounds LXIII, LXVI, LXYII can be treated in Various Sandmeyer reaction as described earlier to yield I sub stituted in the 8 Position. Compound LVI R CH3 when treated with sodium hypochlorite and base at temperatures from 00 700 for half an hour yield the diacid LXVIII. When the process is carried for 2 days under the same conditions LXIX is obtained. EMI21.1 Compounds LVI, LIX, LX can be reduced with sodium borohydrid to afford the corresponding alcohols, LXX, LXXI, LXXII.EMI21.2 It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the nitrile, XVII, can be substituted for the nitrile starting material, XXVII, in the foregoing reaction se quences in order to prepare correspondingly substituted 10,11 dihydro 11 oxodibenzo b,f thiepins. In addition to their therapeutic properties as noted above, the 3 carboxylic acid derivatives of this invention serve as valuable intermediates in the preparation of other variously substituted thiepins of formula I. Thus, for example, the 3carboxylic acid of formula XVIII R1 R as defined in formula I may be converted readily into the corresponding acid halide, preferably the acid chloride, by treating the carboxylic acid with a thionyl halide, preferably thionyl chloride. The resulting 3 halocarbonyl l0,11 dihydro ll oxodi benz b,f 1,43thiepin i.e., the 3 chlorocarbonyl compound of formula LXXII I then may be treated with various well known reagents to form desired ester and amide derivatives.These reactions are illustrated in the following reaction scheme whereinR is as previously defined, it being understood that they are equally applicable to the 3 carboxylic acids of formula IX or XXIII.EMI22.1 Thus, for example, the chlorocarbonyl compound of formula LXXI II may be treated a with a loweralkanol such as, for example, methanol, ethanol, 2 propanol, butanol and 2 butanol, to form the corresponding loweralkyl ester, LXXIV EMI23.1 b with ammonia to form the corresponding carboxamide, LXXV EMI23.2 c with an N loweralkylamine such as for example, methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, isopropylamine and butylamine, or an N,N diloweralkylamine such as, for example, dimethylamine, diethylamine, dipropylamine and dibutylamine, to form the corresponding N loweralkylcarboxamideLXXVI or N,N diloweralkylcarboxamide, LXXVZI EMI24.1 Cd with a loweralkylsulphonamide such as, for example, methane sulphonamide, ethane sulphonamide, propane sulphonamide and butane sulphonamide, to form the corresponding N loweralkylsulfonylcarboxamide, LXXVIII EMI24.2 e with 2 imino 3 methylthiazolidine to form the corresponding 3 methyl 2 thiazolidinylidene carboxamide, LXXIX EMI24.3 C with a lpweralkyldiol such as, for example ethylene glycol trimethylene glycol and 1,4 butanediol, to form the corresponding hydroxyloweralkylester, LXXX EMI25.1 g with an N,N diloweralkylaminoloweralkanol such as, for example, N,N dimethylethanolamine, N,N diethylethanolamine, 3 N,N dimethylaminopropan l ol and 4 N,N diethylaminobutanl ol, to form the corresponding N,N diloweralkylaminoloweralkyl ester, LXXXI EMI25.2 h with an amino acid such as, for example, glycine, alanine and valine, to form the corresponding N carboxyloweralkylcarboxamide,LXXXII EMI26.1 i with an alkali metal salt of a hydroxyloweralkanoic acid such as, for example, hydroxi acetic acid, 3 hydroxybutyric acid and hydroxypropionic acid, to form the corresponding carboxyloweralkyi ester, LXXXIII EMI26.2 Where the corresponding sulfinyl or sulfonyl derivatives are desired, the corresponding 11oxide or ll,ll dioxide 3 carboxylic acid may be sub etituted for starting material XVIII in the foregoing reaction sequence.Alternatively, it will be clear to those skilled in the art that the product esters and umides obtains in the foregoing reaction sequence may be oxidized by the techniques already to ced to obtain the corresponding sulfinyl or sulfonyl derivatives. Those thiepins of this invention wherein the substituent at the 3 position is 3 hydroxy 1,2,5thiadiazol 4 yl are prepared by refluxing a 3cyano intermediate a compound of formula XVII where R1 R as defined in formula I, for example in formic acid in the presence of Raney nickel alloy for 1 to 2 hours in order to obtain the corresponding l0,11 dihydro ll oxodibenzo b,f thiepin 3 carboxaldehyde. The aldehyde product then is converted into the corresponding 3 2 inoacetonitrile by treatment with sodium cyanide in an alcoholic solvent saturated with ammonia and in the presence of ammonium chloride and ammonium hydroxide. The reaction usually is conducted at room temperature and requires from 8 to 16 hours for completion.The aminoacetonitrile so produced is treated with concentrated hydrochloric acid at room temperature for 20 to 45 minutes in order to obtain the corresponding 3 2 aminoacetamide which then is treated with sulfur monochloride in dimethylformamide to obtain the desired l0,11 dihydro ll oxo dibenzotb,f thiepin 3 13 hydroxy 1,2,5 thiadiazol 4 yl of formula LXXXIV. This reaction sequence is illustrated in the following diagram. EMI28.1 The novel thiepinsof this invention wherein the substituent at the 3 position is 4 3 hydroxy A pyrroline 3 yl 2,5 dione are prepared from the appropriately substituted 3 carboxylic acid by reducing the acid to the correspondinq alcohol with borane in tetrahydrofuran. The reaction conveniently is carried out at room temperature under an inert atmosphere and usually requires 2 to 4 hours for completion. The alcohol then is brominated with phosphorous tribromide and the bromomethyl compound so produced is treated with sodium cyanide to form the corresponding 3 cyanomethyl derivative. These reactions may be carried out at room temperature and usually require from 1 to 3 hours for completion. The cyanomethyl intermediate then is hydrolyzed to the corresponding acetic acid which is treated with thionyl chloride followed by ammonia to form the corresponding 3acetamide derivative by techniques already described.The acetamide then is treated with diethyloxalate in dimethylformamide in the presence of potassium t butoxide to form the desired dibenzo b,f thiepin 3 4 hydroxy A3 pyrrolin 3 yl 2 , 5 dione , LXXXV.This reaction sequence is illustrated in the diagram below. EMI30.1 EMI31.1 Where corresponding sulfinyl or sulfonyl derivatives are desired, the products of the four reaction schemes described immediately above may be oxidized by the techniques already described. It will be noted that the reaction sequence described above affords not only thiepins of this invention wherein the substituent at the 3 position is 4 hydroxy A3 pyrroline 3 yl 2,5 dione, but, in Steps A D, leads also to the preparation of those thiepins of this invention wherein the substituent at the 3 position is a loweralkanoic acid i.e., compounds of formulaI wherein A isEMI32.1 n is an integer between 1 and 4 and R2 is hydroxy . Thus, Steps A D, as described above, starting with the appropriately substituted 3 carboxylic acid, through reduction, bromination, cyanization and oxidation, affords the corresponding 3 acetic acid derivative.Quite obviously, the described reduction, bromination, cyanization and oxidation sequence can be repeated, employing the 3 acetic acid derivative as starting material, in order to obtain the corresponding propionic acid derivative which, in turn, can be employed as starting material for preparing the corresponding butyric acid derivative. In this manner, any desired 3 loweralkanoic acid derivative of the instant invention readily is prepared. Corresponding sulfinyl or sulfonyl derivatives are prepared by the oxidation techniques previously described. The 3 cyanoloweralkyl intermediates obtained from Steps A C in the reaction sequence described above also serve as intermediates in the preparation of other therapeutically active thiepins of formula I. Thus, for example, an appropriately substituted 3 cyanomethyl lD,ll 3 oxodibenzotb,fZthiepin may be treated with sodium azide and ammonia by techniques prev ion sly described to form the corresponding 3 lH tetrazol S ylmethyll0,ll dihydro ll oxo dibenzo b,f thiepin and the product, if desired, can be oxidized to form the corresponding sulfinyl or sulfonyr derivative. As noted above, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the novel thiepins also are included within the scope of this invention. The term, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, is intended to include salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable non toxic acids and bases such as, for example, ammonium salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium and potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as magnesium and calcium salts, salts of organic bases such as amine salts derived from mono , di and tri loweralkyl or loweralkanoyl amines such as trimethylamine, dimethylamine and triethanolamine, salts derived from heterocyclic amines such as piperidine, pyridine, piperazine and morpholine, and salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, tartaric acid and propionic acid.

These conditions include asthma, inflammatory states such as arthritis, allergy, diarrhea, hypertension, angina, platelet aggregation, cerebral spasm, premature abortion and dismenorrhea. In particular, they are of value in reaginic mediated asthma extrinsic asthma . The magnitude of a prophylactic or therapeutic dose of compound of formula I will, of course, vary with the nature and the severity of the condition to be treated and with the particular compound of formula I and its route of administration. In general, the dose range lies within the range of 0.2 mg. to 100 mg. peXr kg.body weight of a mammal. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of formulaI as an active ingredient, and may also contain pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The compositions include compositions suitable for oral, rectal, opthalmic, pulmonary, nasal, dermal, topical or parenteral including subcutaneous, intramuscular and intravenous administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated and on the nature of the active ingredient. They may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. For use where a composition for intravenous administration is employed, 9 suitable dosage range is from 0.2 to 10 mg, preferably 1 to 5 mg. of a compound of formula I per kg. of body weight per day and in the case where an oral composition is employed a suitable dosage range is about, e.g., 1 to 50 mg. of a compound of formulaI per kg. of body weight per day, preferably from 10 to 40 mg. kg. Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for oral administration and by inhalation in the case of asthma therapy may be presented as discrete units such ag capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient as a powder or granules or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid, a non aqueous liquid, an oil inwater emulsion or a water in oil liquid emulsion.Such compositions may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy but all methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example, a tablet may be prepared by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients.Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine, the active ingredient in a free flowing form such as powder or granules, op tionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, lubricating, surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine, a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent.Desirably, each tablet contains from 50 mg. to 500 mg. of the active ingredient and each cachet or capsule contains from 50 mg. to 500 mg. of the active ingredient. Although the instant invention has been described in the foregoing specification in terms of the use of the novel thiepin disclosed herein in the treatment and control of human and warmblooded animal disease conditions characterized by excessive undesirable contractile activity of prostaglandins and prostaglandin biosynthetic intermediates, and particularly of asthma, it will be recognized by those skilled in the art that, in addition to the involvement of contractile prostaglandins in chronic obstructive lung disease e.g., asthma , prostaglandins play a role in other allergic conditions as well as in inflammation, diarrhea, hypertension, angina, cerebral spasm, premature abortion and dismenorrhea. Also, the thiepins of this invention are potent TXA2 biosynthesis inhibitors, inhibiting platelate aggregation, and can be useful in diseases such as atherosclerosis, variant anginal and myocardial infarction. Applicants consider application of the thiepins disclosed and claimed herein to the treatment and control of such disease conditions to be obvious equivalents to the invention as disclosed by applicants and to fall within the scope of the instant invention.
