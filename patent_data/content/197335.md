## Description
The present invention relates to the field of biotechnology and particularly to the application of recombinant DNA technology to microorganisms involved in the production of L lysine. More particularly, the invention relates to the molecular cloning of a gene encoding an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of L lysine and the expression of said gene in Improvement of the so called glutamic acid producing microorganisms such as microorganisms of the genera Large scale production of L lysine, however, still remains difficult and it is desirable to improve the L lysine productivity of the above bacteria by a more efficient utilization of recombinant DNA technology. Thus, in employing recombinant DNA technology, the The Fig. 1 is a flow sheet showing a process for preparing vector plasmid pFC18, wherein Spc Sm represents the resistance markers spectinomycin and streptomycin, Ap represents ampicillin, and Tc tetracycline. Any of the microorganisms known as the glutamic acid producing microorganisms belonging to the genus Wild type strains without lysine productivity can be used as hosts, but strains having lysine productibity can also be used. Lysine producing strains, such as e.g. amino acid requiring mutant strains, amino acid analog resistant mutant strains, etc. are applicable. The gene involved in the synthesis of DDPS, can be derived from eukaryotes, prokaryotes, viruses, bacteriophages or plasmids. The gene of a bacterial strain for example, of the genus As vectors for incorporating the DNA fragment containing the gene, pCG1, pCG2, pCG4, pCG11, pCE54, pCB101, etc. are preferably used. Processes for producing these vectors are described in Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application Nos. 134500 82, 183799 82, 35197 83 and 105999 83. The recombinant DNA comprising the DNA fragment containing the gene involved in the synthesis of DDPS and the vector DNA can be obtained by standard recombinant DNA techniques which comprises cleaving Instead of cloning the recombinant DNA directly in The present invention is explained in more detail below, with reference to a gene involved in the synthesis of DDPS of A DNA fragment containing dapA of Chromosomal DNA from Substrain TM103 of It was proved by complementation studies that the plasmid pCD1 contains the DDPS gene all ampicillin resistant transformants of the DDPS deficient pAC2 is prepared by the following steps pFC18 and pCD1 plasmid DNAs are cleaved with the restriction enzyme SalI, then mixed together and subjected to the action of T4 DNA ligase. Then the DDPS defective substrain TM103 of The SalI cleavage products of the plasmid DNA are separated by agarose gel electrophoresis to investigate the structure of the plasmid. It is confirmed that the SalI DNA fragment of 4.2 Kb derived from pCD1 is inserted in the SalI cleavage site of pFC18. Then, the DDPS defective mutant strain AT998 and the mutant strain AT997 which are substrains of The production of L lysine by pAC2 transformants can be carried out according to a culturing method used in the conventional process for producing L lysine by fermen tation. That is, when the transformant is cultured in a conventional medium containing a carbon source, a nitrogen source, inorganic matters, amino acids, vitamins, etc. under aerobic conditions, while controlling the temperature, pH, etc., lysine is formed and accumulates in the culture broth. Thus, L lysine can be recovered from the culture broth according to known methods for example, by active carbon treatment, ion exchange resin treatment, etc. Thus, L lysine can be produced in a higher yield by using a pAC2 containing strain of the genus The plasmid vector only provides for stable inheritance of the gene involved in the synthesis of DDPS. Thus, not only pFC18 exemplified in the present specification, but also other plasmids autonomously replicable in a microorganism of the genus In spite of many common microbiological proper ties, microorganisms with high glutamic acid productivity so called glutamic acid producing microorganisms are classified as comprising various species and even genera such as In the present specification, a case where a recombinant DNA is introduced into Certain specific embodiments of the present invention are illustrated by the following representative examples. 1 Construction of a substrain TM103 of To more readily clone a gene involved in the synthesis of DDPS of From a substrain WA802 of 2 Cloning of DDPS gene dapA of Cloning was carried out by using a host vector system of 12 units of the restriction enzyme salI product of Takara Shuzo Co., Japan were added to 120 µℓ of a reaction solution for the restriction enzyme SalI 10 mM Tris HCl, 7 mM MgCl₂, 100mM NaCl, pH 7.5 containing 4 µg of pBR322 DNA and 8 µg of chromosomal DNA of The ligation reaction mixture was used for the transformation of Plasmid DNA was isolated from the cultured cells of purified transformants according to the method of An pCD1 was used to transform the DDPS defective mutant strain AT998 and THPS the mutant strain AT997, which were substrains of The restriction deficient mutation of the strain TM103 which was used in the cloning step was utilized merely to increase the yield of transformants cloning, and strains without such a mutation can also be used as host microorganisms. 3 Preparation of plasmid pAC2 The 4.2 Kb SalI DNA fragment containing the dapA gene derived from pCG11 was isolated from a strain containing pCG11 ATCC 39022 according to the procedure previously disclosed by the present inventors Japanese Published Unexamined Patent application No. 134500 82, Example 1, Item 1 . pBR322 user for this purpose was a commercially available product of Takara Shuzo Co., Japan. 8 units of the restriction enzyme PstI product of Takara Shuzo Co., Japan were added, to 120 µℓ of a reaction solution 20 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 , 10 mM MgCl₂, 50 mM NH₄ ₂SO₄ and 0.01 bovine serum albumin containing 4 µg each of pCG11 and pBR322 plasmid DNAs. The mixture was incubated at 37 C for 60 minutes. The reaction was stopped by heating at 65 C for 10 minutes. Then, 30 µℓ of T₄ DNA ligase buffer solution, 30 µℓ of 5 mM ATP, 0.3 units of T₄ DNA ligase and 120 µℓ of H₂O were added thereto, and the mixture was incubated at 12 C for 16 hours. Substrain WA802 of A recombinant plasmid containing dapA derived from The ligation reaction product was used to transform the Transformation with pAC2 of said AT998 and AT997 confirmed that the spectinomycin resistant transformants were rendemed to be diaminopimelic acid independent at the same time. 4 Introduction of pAC2 into Transformation of 0.1 mℓ of a starting culture of strain RH6 was inoculated in 10 mℓ of SSM medium a medium containing 10 g of glucose, 4 g of NH₄Cl, 2 g of urea 1 g of yeast extract, 1 g of KH₂PO₄, 3 g of K₂HPO₄, 0.4 g of MgCl₂ 6H₂O, 10 mg of FeSO₄ 7H₂O, 0.2 mg of MmSO₄ 4 6H₂O, 0.9 mg of ZnSO₄ 7H₂O, 0.4 mg of CuSO₄ 5H₂O, 0.09 mg of Na₂B₄O₇ 10H₂O, 0.04 mg of NH₄ ₆ Mo₇O Then, 1 mℓ of the protoplast solution was centrifuged at 2,500 x g for 15 minutes to precipitate the protoplasts. The protoplasts were suspended in 1 mℓ of TSMC buffer solution containing 10 mM MgC1₂, 30 mM CaCl₂, 50 mM Tris HCl of pH 7.5 and 400 mM sucrose and washed following centrifugation. The protoplasts were resuspended in 0.1 mℓ of TSMC buffer solution.

After 3 minutes, 2 mℓ of RCGP medium was added to the mixture, and the protoplasts were precipitated by centrifugation at 2,500 x g for 5 minutes. The protoplasts were suspended in 1 mℓ of RCGP, and culturing was carried out with gentle shaking at 30 C for 2 hours. 0.1 mℓ of the protoplast suspension was spread on RCGP agar medium RCGP madium containing 1.4 agar containing 400 µg mℓ spectinomycin, and cultured at 30 C for 6 days. Plasmid DNA was extracted from one of the thus obtained spectinomycin resistant transformants according to the procedure previously disclosed by the present inventors Japanes Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 134500 82, Example 1, Item 1 . Restriction enzyme cleavage and subsequent agarose gel electrophoresis of the thus obtained fragments had all shown that the isolated plasmid had the same structure as pAC2. It was also shown by a transformation test analog out to that p the foregoing item that the plasmid restores the diaminopimelic acid independence of the strains AT998 and AT997 as pAC2 does. The strain which was thus confirmed to be transformed by pAC2 was named 5 Production of L lysine by pAC2 containing strain Production of L lysine by Strain RH6 pAC2 and strain RH6 were separately cultured with shaking in 3 mℓ of NB medium a medium containing 20 g of bouillon and 5 g of yeast extract in 1 ℓ of water and adjusted to pH 7.2 at 30 C for 16 hours.
