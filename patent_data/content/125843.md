# Apparatus for inserting a catheter.

## Abstract
The skin and a subjacent body vessel 68 is pierced with a needle 16 mounted on a fluid fillable chamber 12 at the opposite end of which is a plunger 14 movable into the chamber. In one embodiment, disposed within the needle and chamber is a closed ended flexible catheter 20 . A flexible stylet 22 is disposed in the catheter. The catheter is drawn through the needle and into the body vessel by pushing into the chamber the plunger which engages the distal portion 54 of the stylet. The closed ended pliable catheter is drawn into place in the body vessel by the pushing stylet while fluid is simultaneously infused into the body vessel to dilate it and thereby ease the advancement of the catheter with minimal damage to the vessel wall. The chamber 12 and needle 16 are removable from the catheter 20 , leaving it in place in the body for the infusion of fluid. The another embodiment a stiffer, open ended catheter is used and the plunger pushes directly against the catheter to push it into the body vessel.
