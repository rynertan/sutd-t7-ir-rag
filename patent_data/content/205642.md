# D.C. to D.C. converter.

## Abstract
DC converter with a switch mode power supply, in par ticular for continuously operating magnetrons of the type generally used in microwave ovens. By a special tuning of an oscillating circuit 16, 18 forming the control voltage for the switching transistor 9 it is achieved that the switching transistor off time as well as its duty cycle can be varied within large ranges.
