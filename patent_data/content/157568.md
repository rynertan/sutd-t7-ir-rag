# Printing apparatus.

## Abstract
A transfer printing medium comprising a substrate sup porting a thermal transfer dye and a radiation absorber posi tioned to provide thermal energy to the transfer dye when sub jected to radiation within a predetermined absorption wave band, has a radiation absorber which is an infra red absorbing poly substituted phthalocyanine compound in which each of at least five of the peripheral carbon atoms in the 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13 or 16 positions the 3,6 positions of the phthalo cyanine nucleus, as shown in Formula I, is linked by an atom from Group VB or Group VIB of the Periodic Table, other than oxygen, to a carbon atom of an organic radical. In preferred compounds each of the eight 3,6 positions is linked by an atom from Group VB or Group VIB, especially sulphur, selenium or nitrogen, to an organic radical.
