# Method and apparatus for the production of glass beads.

## Abstract
A vortex combustion furnace 1 for the production of glass beads is generally cylindrical and has an outlet flue 24 at its upper end. A burner 13 at the lower end burns a gas air mixture. Secondary air is introduced to the chamber through tangential air inlets 16 and creates a vortex within the cham ber. The vortex has a top hat temperature profile with a central heating region with a temperature in excess of 1000 C and a surrounding cooling region with a temperature not much above ambient. Glass cullet injected into the chamber follows a spiral path in the vortex, is heated, melts to form glass beads, is then cooled and finally is collected after striking the wall of the chamber.
