# A HEAT EXCHANGER FOR FIREPLACES WITH ZIG ZAG PATH OF THE FLAMES

## Abstract
A heat exchanger is provided for a fireplace which com prises a tabular grate, a double walled rectangular, vertical, flat panel located at the back of the fireplace at right angles with the grate tubes, two flat double walled vertical side panels set at about 45 deg with respect to the centerline of the fireplace, a zig zag double walled panel which extends upwards from the upper side of the back panel to nearly reach the inner surface of the fireplace hood and a double walled counter pannel with angled profile which is so positioned with respect to the zig zag panel that a progressively nar rower throat is formed therebetween for the flames and smoke which rise from the hearth. Due to such tortuous pas sage of decreasing cross section for the fire flame and smoke, the overall height of the exchanger can be reduced so that this can be readily removed from the fireplace masonry struc ture.
