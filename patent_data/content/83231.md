# Control circuit for stepping motor.

## Abstract
A control circuit for a stepping motor 13 comprises a voltage multiplier 14 which, in synchronism with the motor timing pulses OS from a pulse generator 11 multiples the supply voltage PW in such a manner as to obtain an energising voltage PA which, at commencement of the excitation of each motor winding, has a value which is a multiple of the value of the supply voltage PW, in order to reduce the rise time of the current in the windings, and to thus improve the dynamic torque availability. A voltage doubler and tripler are described as examples of the circuit 14 .
