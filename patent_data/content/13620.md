## Description
PROCESS FOR ThE PREPARATION OF 4 HYDROXYCYCLOPENT 2 ENO E AND DERIVATIVES This invention relates to a process for the synthetic preparation of 4 hydroxycyclopent 2 enone and derivatives of this compound in which the hydroxyl function is protected, particularly in the chiral 4 R and 4 S enantiomeric forms. These compounds are of importance, for example as intermediates in the synthesis of compounds of the prostaglandin group, including both naturally occurring members and various modified analogues, herein collectively termed prostanoids. The natural prostaglandins are structurally related lipids which are normally present at very low concentrations in human and animal tissues, or are elaborated by these tissues in response to certain stimuli. They are believed to be involved in the control of a wide variety of biological processes, including reproduction, muscle expansion and contraction, respiration, lipid metabolism, kidney function, central nervous system activity, gastric secretion, cardiovascular activity, immune response, and temperature control. Their chemistry and biology have been the subjects of extensive research and review. See for example, P. Crabby ed. , Prostaglandin Research ,Academic Press, New York, 1977 K.H. Gibson, Chem. Soc.Rev., 1977, 6, 489 N. Kharasch and J. Fried eds. , Biochemical Aspects of Prostaglandins and Thromboxanes ,Academic Press, New York, 1977 . A number of routes are available for the laboratory synthesis of both the natural prostaglandins themselves and also modified analogues of the natural prostaglandins. See for example, A. Mitra, The Synthesis of Prostaglandins , Wiley and Sons, Ncw York, 1977 J.S. Bindra andR. Bindra, Prostaglandin Synthesis , Academic Press, NewYork, 1977 P. Crabby ed. , Prostaglandin Research ,Academic Press, New York, 1977 D. Orth and JI. E. Radunz,Top. Curr. Chem.,1977, 72, 51 . Modif.3cd analogues in some cases offer improved stttbility towards met abolic inactivation in tho body, and or improved selectivity of biological action, relative to the natural prostaglandins. One important synthetic route to prostanoids involves the conjugate addition of organometallic reagents to derivatives of 4 hydroxycyclopent 2 enone in which the hydroxyl function is protected with a suitable protecting group see above references . This leads to S alkylated enolates, in which the alkyl substituent will ultimately provide the 6 chain of the prostanoid. Reaction of these enolates with electrophiles permits the introduction of the eventual a chain of the final prostanoids. Thus, for example1 the cumyl ether C. Stork and M. Isobe, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1975, 97, 6260 M.J. Loots and J. Schwartz, Tetrahedron Lett., 1978, 4381 , the t butyldimethylsilyl ether T. Tanaka,S. Kurozumi, T. Toru, M. Kobayashi, S. Miura, andS.

Abstr., 1975, 83, 131204f of racemic 4 hydroxycyclopent 2 enone, and the t butyldimethylsilyl ether of the 4R enantiomer of 4 hydroxycyclopent 2 enone T. Tanaka, S. Kurozumi,T. Toru, M. Kobayashi, S. Miura, and S. Ishimoto,Tetrahedron, 1977, 33, 1105 have been used in this way for the synthesis of various prostanoids, Significantly, the prostanoids resulting from this route possess the required trans, trans relative configuration of the three substituents on the cyclopentanone ring.Furthermore, use of the chiral 4R enantiomers of the 4 hydroxycyclopent 2 enone derivatives leads to prostanoids in which these three ring substituents have the same absolute configuration as in natural prostaglandins. Chiral 4 hydroycyclopent 2 enones have previously been prepared by a combination of chemical and microbiological processes, but the desired 4R enantiomers which result only in low overall yield are not fully optically pure, being present in up to 90E enantiomeric excess T. Tanaka, S. Kurozumi, T. Toru, S. Miura,M. Kobayashi, and S. Ishimoto, Tetrahedron, 1976, 32, 1713, see also S. Kurozumi et. al. U.S. Patent No. 4132726 . Alternatively, chiral 4 hydroxycyclopent 2enones have been prepared by chemical modification of chiral substrates such as 2R, 3R and 2S, 3S tartaric acid K. Ogura, M. Yamashita, and G. Tsuchihashi,Tetrahedron Lett., 1976, 759 see also G. Tsuchihashi, et. al. Japan Kokai 76 95042 and terrein L.A. Mitscher,G.W. Clark, and P.B. Hudson, Tetrahedron Lett., 1978, 2553 but these routes also have disadvantages. In the case of tartaric acid, the resulting chiral 4 hydroxycyclopent 2enones are again only 85 868 optically pure, and the desired 4R enantiomers are derived from the less common 2S, 3S or D tartaric acid.Terrein yields the acetate ester of the desired 4R 4 hydroxycyclopent 2enone optically pure, but is itself a complex metabolite available only from fermentation of certain fungi. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved process for the preparation of 4 hydroxycyclopent 2 enone and derivatives thereof in which the hydroxyl function is protected, particularly in the chiral 4R and 4S enantiomeric forms. According to the present invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of compounds of the general formula I EMI4.1 of which formulae Ia and Ib represent the enantiomeric forms thereof EMI4.2 wherein R represents hydrogen or a protecting group, which comprises the selective reduction of compounds of the general formula IIEMI4.3 of which formulae IIa and IIb represent the enantiomeric forms thereofEMI4.4 wherein is as defined above, and Hal represents halogen, particularly chlorine, bromine or iodine, and, if desired, total or partial inversion of the hydroxyl or protected hydroxyl substituent. As used throughout this specification, the term protecting group is used to denote a removable protective group for an alcoholic hydroxyl group.Such groups are well known. Examples of groups which protect as ethers include, for example, substituted alkyl groups such as alkoxyalkyl groups, tetrahydrofuran2 yl and tetrahydropyran 2 yl groups, and substituted silyl groups such as silyl groups trisubstituted with alkyl and or aryl residues, for example, the t butyldimethylsilyl group. Examples of groups which protect as esters include derivatives of alkyl or aryl carboxylic acids, for example, acetyl and benzyl groups. It will be appreciated that the compounds of the general formulae I and II referred to throughout this specification are chiral and the present invention relates both to the individual enantiomers and to any mixtures thereof, whether these mixtures be racemic or partially racemic. In accordance with accepted nomenclature, the dotted lines used in the formulae throughout this specification indicate that the attached group lies behind the general plane of the ring system, i.e., that the group is in an a configuration whilst the thickened lines indicate that the attached group lies in front of the general plane of the ring system, i.e., that the group is in a B configuration. The wavy lines used in the formulae throughout this specification indicate that the attached group is present in an a or 8 configuration or is present in both a and B configurations, thus including not only both individual enantiomers thereof but also all mixtures of such enantiomers. As noted above, various prostanoids have been prepared from compounds of the general formula I. If desired, the protecting group in these compounds may be removed or replaced by an alternative protecting group prior to conversion of the compound of general formula I into such prostanoids. In addition, a racemic mixture of a compound of the general formula I may, if desired, be totally or partially resolved. Such resolution may be effected by known methods. Formulae 1 to 8 referred to in the following detailed description of an example of the process of the present invention are set out on the following page. It will be appreciated from the above general description and from the further description which follows that the present invention offers advantages in the preparation of 4 hydroxycyclopent 2 enone 1 R H and its derivatives 1 R protecting group , particularly in either enantiomeric form 2 R H or protecting group or 3 R H or protecting group . These advantages include the use of a cheap, readily available starting material, and its conversion by efficient, convenient, non microbiological processes into the required optically pure enantiomers. The preparation of 4S 3 chloro 4 hydroxycyclopent2 enone 5 R H and its ethers 5 R protecting group exemplified by its t butyldimethylsilyl ether 5 R SiButMe2 from phenol or 2,4,6 trichlorophenol has been described in copending European Patent ApplicationNo. 79301822.7 see also M. Gill and R.W. Rickards,J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm., 1979, 121 . In this preparation, the benzenoid ring undergoes contraction to lR , 4R 3,5,5, trichloro 1,4 dihydroxycyclopent 2 ene l carboxylic acid, and chirality is introduced by resolution of this racemic acid into its 1R, 4R and 1S, 45 enantiomers 7 and 8 respectively.The 1R, 4R enantiomer 7 is then oxidatively decarbosy lated and partially dechlorinated to yield 4S 3 chloro EMI7.1 4 hydroxycyclopent 2 enone 5 R H , derivatisation then affording the 4S ethers 5 R protecting group . The preparation of the enantiomeric 4R 3 chloro 4 hydroxycyclopent 2 enone 6 R H and its ethers 6 R protecting group ,exemplified by its t butyldimethylsilyl ether 6 R SiButMe2 by a similar process from the IS, 4S enantiomer 8 of the 3,5,5 trichloro 1,4dihydroxycyclopent 2 ene l carboxylic acid has also been described in copending European Application No. 79301822.7. These 4S and 4R enantiomers of 3 chloro 4hydroxycyclopent 2 enone 5 and 6 R H can be selectively reduced by suitable reagents, for example bimetallic couples, to the corresponding 45 and 4R enantiomers of 4 hydroxycyclopent 2 enone 3 and 2 R H . Alternatively, the hydroxyl functions in the 45 and 4R enantiomers 5 and 6 R H can be protected as suitable derivatives 5 and 6 R protecting group , for example as the substituted alkyl or trisubstituted silyl ethers, before reduction to the corresponding derivatives 3 and 2 R protecting group of the 4S and 4R enantiomers of 4 hydroxycyclopent 2 enone. The protecting groups in the reduction products 3 and 2 R protecting group can then be removed if desired to yield the corresponding 4S and 4R enantiomers of 4 hydroxycyclopent 2 enone 3 and 2 R H . By these processes described, phenol can be converted via the 1R, 4R 3,5, 5 trichloro l, 4 dihydroxycyclopent 2 ene 1 carboxylic acid 7 into 4S 4 hydroxycyclopent2 enone 3 R H and its derivatives 3 R protecting group , or via the enantiomeric 1S, 4S acid 8 into 4R 4 hydroxycyclopent 2 enone 2 R H and its derivatives 2 R protecting group . However, 4S 4hydroxycyclopent 2 enone 3 R H and its derivatives 3 R protecting group can also be prepared from the 1S, 4S acid 8 by carrying out an inversion of configuration of the secondary hydroxyl or protected secondary hydroxyl centre.Similarly, 4R 4 hydroxycyclopent 2 enone 2 R H and its derivatives 2 R protecting group can also be prepared from the 1R, 4R acid 7 . It will be appreciated that such inversion may be effected at any appropriate stage of the synthetic sequence, either before or after the selective reduction of the compounds of the general formula II to compounds of the general formula I. Bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reactions are suitable for this inversion. Specific details of the reactions involved in the processes of this invention are illustrated by the following detailed examples. In these examples, all temperatures are in degrees Centigrade, and technical terms e.g. chromatography, etc., have the usual meaning in the art. Crude reaction products can be purified by the means described herein, or by other means known in the art.EXAMPLE 1 4R 4 t Butyldimethylsilyloxy cyclopent 2 enone 2 R SiButMe2 The 4R enone 6 R SiButMe2 125mg, 0.5 mmol in methanol 3 ml was added rapidly with vigorous stirring to zinc silver couple freshly prepared from zic 700mg R.D.
