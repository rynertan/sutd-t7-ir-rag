European Patent Application No 0004793 describes a process for preparing inter alia pyrimidone derivatives of general formula 1 EMI1.1 where Het is an optionally substituted 5 or 6 membered fully unsaturated nitrogen containing heterocyclic group in which the substituents which can be same or different are one or more C14 alkyl, trifluoromethyl, halogen, hydroxy, C1 4 alkoxy, or amino groups n is 2 or 3 Z is hydrogen, or C14 alkyl A is C15 alkylene optionally interrupted by oxygen or sulphur and B is hydrogen, methyl, C36 cycloalkyl, an optionally substituted heteroaryl group where the substituents which can be the same or different are one or more C14 alkoxy or hydroxy groups or B is a naphthyl, 5 or 6 2,3 dihydro 1,4benzodioxinyl or a 4 or 5 1,3 benzodioxolyl group or an optionally substituted phenyl group where the substituents which are the same of different are one or more C14 alkyl, C1 4 alkoxy, halogen, aryl Cl 4alkoxy , hydroxy C1 4alkoxy C 4alkoxy, trifluoromethyl, di Cl 4alkyl amino, phenoxy, halophenyl or C1 alkoxyphenyl groups where an amine of formula 2 , in which Het, and n are as defined for formula 1 , is reacted with a 2 nitroaminopyrimidone of formula 3 , in which Z, A and B areEMI1.2 Many of the compounds of formula 1 are described inGerman Offenlegungsschriften 2643670 and 2658267 as having histamine H1 and H2 antagonist activity and in GermanOffenlegungsschrift 2421548 as having histamine H2 antagonist activity. Histamine H2 antagonists and compounds which have histamine H1 and H2 antagonist activity are useful as inhibitors of gastric acid secretion, as antiinflammatory agents and as agents which inhibit the effects of histamine on blood pressure. According to the present invention, the compounds of formula 1 above and acid additions salts thereof, are prepared by a process which comprises reacting a compound of formula 4 Het CH L 4 or an acid addition salts thereof where Het is as defined with reference to formula 1 provided that any substituents which interfere with the reaction are protected with a compound of formula 5 EMI2.1 or an acid addition salt thereof where n, Z, A and B are as defined with reference to formula 1 provided that any phenolic hydroxy groups within B are optionally protected and thereafter removing any protecting groups, and optionally converting the product into an acid addition Sc The compounds of formulae 1 and 5 are shown and described as 4 pyrimidone deiratares but is is appreciated thai they can exist in equilibrium with other tautomeric forms as follows EMI3.1 Examples of the optionally substituted heterocyclic groups which Het represents are optionally substituted imidazolyl, pyridyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, triazolyl, and thiadiazolyl groups. Preferably the group Het is linked to the methylene group shown in formula 1 by a carbon atom of the heterocyclic group which is adjacent to a nitrogen atom. Examples of the group Het are 2 or 4 imidazolyl optionally substituted by C14 alkyl preferably methyl , halogen preferably chlorine or bromine , trifluoromethyl or hydroxymethyl, 2 pyridyl optionally substituted by one or more which can be the same or different C14 alkyl preferably methyl , C14 alkoxy preferably methoxy , halogen preferably chlorine or bromine , amino or hydroxy groups 2 thiazolyl, 3 isothiazolyl optionally substituted by chlorine or bromine, 3 1,2,5 thiadiazolyl optionally substituted by chlorine or bromine, or 2 5 amino 1,3,4 thiadiazolyl . Particular Het groups are 5 methyl 4 imidazolyl, 5 bromo 4 imidazolyl, 2 pyridyl, 3 methyl 2 pyridyl, 3 methoxy 2 pyridyl, 3 ethoxy 2 pyridyl, 3,4 dimethoxy 2 pyridyl, 3 fluoro 2 pyridyl, 3 chloro 2pyridyl, 3 bromo 2 pyridyl, 3 iodo 2 pyridyl, 3 bromo 4methyl 2 pyridyl and 2 thiazolyl. Examples of heteroaryl groups B are pyridyl, furanyl, thienyl, thiazolyl, oxazolyl, isothiazolyl, imidazolyl, pyrimidyl, pyrazinyl, pyridazyl, thiadiazolyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, 5,6,7,8 tetrahydroquinolyl, 1,3 dioxolopyridyl, benzimidazolyl and benzthiazolyl. Particular heteroaryl groups for B are 2 furanyl, 2 thienyl, 2 pyridyl, 3 pyridyl, 4 pyridyl, 2 thiazolyl, 2 imidazolyl, 2 pyrimidyl, 2 pyrazyinl, 3 pyridazyl, 3 uinolyl and l isoquinolyl optionally substituted by one or more C1 4 alkyl or C14 alkoxy groups. Specific heteroaryl groups for B are 2 furanyl, 3 pyridyl, 6 methyl 3 pyridyl, 5,6 dimethyl 3 pyridyl, 6 methoxy 3 pyridyl, 2 methoxy 4 pyridyl, 4 methoxy 2 pyridyl, 2 hydroxy 4 pyridyl 4 hydroxy 2 pyridyl and 6 hydroxy 3 pyridyl. Specific substituted phenyl groups B are 3 chlorophenyl, 3,4 dichlorophenyl, 3 methoxyphenyl, 4 methoxyphenyl, 3,4 dimethoxyphenyl and 3,4,5 trimethoxyphenyl. Specific meanings of A are methylene, l,l ethanediyl CHCH3 , l,2 ethanediyl CH2CH2 and 1,3 propanediyl CH2CH2C2 . Examples of groups displacable with thiol whichL represents are hydroxy, acyloxy, C14 alkoxy, chlorine, bromine and triarylphosphonium. When L is acyloxy preferably it is acetoxy, methane sulphonyloxy or p toluenesulphonyloxy. When L is C14 alkoxy preferably it is methoxy. When L is triarylphosphonium preferably it is triphenylphosphonium. Examples of phenolic hydroxy protecting groups are methoxymethil, methylthiomethyl, tetrahydropyranyl, benzyl, acyl particularly C14 alkanoyl and C14 alkyl. When L is hydroxy or C14 alkoxy the reaction is carried out under acidic conditions for example in acetic acid or in aqueous hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid. When L is acyloxy, chlorine, bromine or triarylphosphonium, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a base for example an alkali metal C14 alkoxide in particular sodium ethoxide. Preferably L is hydroxy or methoxy except where Het or B is an acid labile group when it is preferably chlorine or bromine. Examples of acid addition salts of compounds of formula 1 , 4 and 5 are those with hydrochloric and hydrobromic acids. The reaction can be carried out in the presence of a solvent, the choice of which is not critical to the success of the reaction provided that it is substantially inert to the reagents and product. Where the reaction is carried out under acidic conditions in one of the acids given above by way of example, the solvent can be the acid itself. Where the reaction is carried out under basic conditions using one of the bases given above by way of example, the solvent can be an excess of the corresponding C14 alkanol. The reaction can be carried out at moderate temperature for example up to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. Preferably approximately equimolar amounts of the reagents are used, although an excess, for example a slight excess of from 1.1 to 1.5 molar equivalents or a larger excess of from 1.5 to 4 molar equivalents, of either reagent can be used. An excess of either reagent can be present at the start of the reaction or can be added during the course of the reaction. The process of this invention is particularly useful for preparing compounds of formula 1 in which Het is a 2 thiazolyl, 5 methyl 4 imidazolyl, 5 bromo 4 imidazolyl, 3 bromo 2 pyridyl, 3 chloro 2 pyridyl, 3 methoxy 2 pyridyl or 3 hydroxy 2 pyridyl group, and in which n is 2. Specifically the process is useful for preparing a 2 2 5 methyl 4 imidazolylmethylthio ethylamino 5 3 methoxybenzyl 4 pyrimidone b 2 2 5 methyl 4 imidazolylmethylthio ethylamino 5 5 1,3 benzodioxolyl methyl 4 pyrimidone c 2 2 5 methyl 4 imidazolylmethylthio ethylaminol 5 3 pyridylmethyl 4 pyrimidone and d 2 2 5 methyl 4 imidazolylmethylthio ethylamino 5 6 methyl 3 pyridylmethyl 4 pyrimidone. Compounds of formula 5 above can be prepared by reacting a compound of formula 6 GS CH2 nNH2 6 where G is hydrogen or a thiol protecting group and n is as defined with reference to formula 1 with a compound of formula 7 EMI7.1 where Z, A and B are as defined with reference to formula 1 and Q is a group which is displacable with an amine and optionally converting the group G in the product when it is a thiol protecting group into hydrogen. The products of this latter process have generalEMI7.2 where A, B, Z and n are as defined with reference to formula 1 and G is as defined with reference to formula 6 Specific compounds of formula 5a are 2 2 Mercaptoethylamino 5 5 1,3 benzodioxolyl methyl 4 pyrimidone, 2 2 Mercaptoethylamino 5 3 pyridylmetayl 4 pyrimidone, 2 2 Tritylthioethylamino 5 5 1,3 benzodioxolyl methyl 4 pyrimidone, 2 2 Mercaptoethylamino 5 6 methyl 3 pyridylmethyl 4 pyrimidone and their acid addition salts. Examples of groups displacable by amine which Q represents are nitroamino NO2EE. , C1 4 alkylthio, benzylthio, chlorine and bromine. Preferably Q is nitroamino or C1 4 alkylthio parti cularly methylthio. Examples of thiol protecting groups which G represents are trityl, 4 methoxybenzyl, ethylcarbamoyl and S CX2 NH2 in this latter case the thiol is protected as the disulphide. The reaction can be carried out at an elevated temperature in the absence of a solvent, for example at 80 to 170 C, preferably 120 to 140 C, or in a solvent at an elevated temperature, for example at the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. The choice of solvent is affected by solubility characteristics of the reagent, Preferably the solvent is pyridine, a picoline or mixture of picolines, a C14 alkanol, preferably ethanol or l propanol, an aqueous mixture of a C14 alkanol, 1,2ethanediol, a ketone, for example acetone or 2 butanone, or a polar aprotic solvent, for example dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulphoxide, hexamethylphosphoramide, sulpholane, acetonitrile or nitromethane.Particularly preferably the reaction is carried out in refluxing ethanol, refluxing l propanol or refluxing pyridine. Where the thiol protecting group is acid labile for example trityl it is possible to carry out both the steps of removing the thiol protecting group and the subsequent reaction with the compound of formula 4 simultaneously in the acid media referred to previously. That is to say the compound of formula 5 is generated in situ from a compound of formula 5b EMI9.1 where G is an acid labile thiol protecting group and n,Z, A and B are as defined with reference to formula 1 . A particularly suitable acid medium for this purpose is acetic acid containing hydrogen chloride. When the thiol protecting group G is S CH2 nNE.2 the disulphide obtained can be converted into the corresponding compound of formula 5 by reduction for example with lithium aluminium hydride or by using a mercaptan for example dithiothreitol or using sodium sulphide. The pyrimidones of formula 7 can be made by known methods for example where Q is nitroamino the compounds can be prepared by reacting nitroguanidine with a compound of formula 8 EMI9.2 in which Z, A and B are as defined with reference to formula 1 and R is C14 alkyl or aryl Cl 4 alkyl , in the presence of a base. Preferably this reaction is carried out in a C14 alkanol with a sodium C14 alkoxide as the base, and preferably at the boiling point of the reaction mixture.
