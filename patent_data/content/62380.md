# Method of producing an anode for X ray tube and anode.

## Abstract
The invention relates to anodes for X ray tubes and a method of producing same. Several layers are deposited one after an other onto a substrate S by means of chemical vapour deposition. The proposed combination of layers results in a proper bond to the substrate. The combination comprises a first layer 1 of molybdenum or a molybdenum alloy a second layer 2 of a tungsten molybdenum alloy and a third layer 3 of tungsten or a tungsten alloy. The composition of the second layer 2 varies over its thickness.
