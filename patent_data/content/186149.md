# NON AGED INORGANIC OXIDE CONTAINING AEROGELS AND THEIR PREPARATION

## Abstract
The invention is directed to inorganic oxide containing aeorgels and the method of preparing such oxide containing aerogels which are characterized by high surface areas and high pore volume. The preparation comprises dissolving the inorganic alkoxide or metal salt in a solvent optionally containing a catalytic amount of an acid or base and hydrolyzing the metal compound which is then further treated with a fluid at or above its critical temperature and pressure to extract the solvent.
