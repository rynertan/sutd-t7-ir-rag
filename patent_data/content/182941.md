## Description
DUAL CURING, METHOD OF PREPARING SAME AND DIELECTRIC SOFT GEL COtlPOSITIONS THEREOF This invention relates to curable polyorganosiloxane silicone compositions particularly adapted for use in electronic potting applications. Because of their excellent thermal stability, low temperature flexibility and high dielectric strength, silicones have been used for potting and encapsulating electrical devices such as integrated circuits. They are typically used as elastomeric or gel like materials providing shock, vibrational and thermal stress protection oli fragile electronic components. References relating generally to silicone gel encapsulants include U.S. Patents 3,933,712 4,072,635 4,087,585 4,271,425 4,374,967 and D. Dickson, Jr., Proceedings Electric Electronic Intel. Conf. 12, 92 1975 . See also prior art description in U.S. Patent 4,374,967. The present commercially available potting silicones include one component compositions such as U.S.Patent 4,271 425 which are cured by moisture, requiring from several hours to days to complete the cure. Faster cures may be obtained from two component systems such as those inU.S. Patent 4,087,585 if elevated temperatures are provided.The two compollent systems which require a platinum catalyst, however, are inhibited by orgaiotin compounds, sulfur, amines, urethanes and unsaturated llydrocarboli plasticizers on the substrate surfaces. It is known that certain silicones containing meth acrylate or acrylate functional groups may be cured by ultraviolet light. U.S. Patents 4,201,808 and 4,348,454 andU.K. Patent Application GB 2039287A all describe Uv curing compositions of silicones containing methacrylates or acrylates for paper release coatings. The compositiolls do not produce jelly like or elastomeric materials. Accordingty, it is desirable to have a UV curable silicone composition which will produce an elastomeric or soft gel consistency upon curing. Furthermore, it is desirable that the composition be capable of curing by another mechanism in areas which are not readily accessable by W irradiation.Summary of The Invention The present invention is a silicone composition having the desired characteristics set forth above. The composition cures to a soft gel or elastomeric consistency in a matter of seconds or minutes upon irradiation with UV light.Furthermore, the composition will moisture cure in shadow areas. The moisture cure capability, however, does not result in loss of the gel or elastomeric properties. The compositions of the invention comprise a mixture, in parts by weight of a 30 100 parts of a reactive polyorganosiloxane terminated with acrylic functional dialkoxysilyl or diaryloxysilyl groups and containing 0.1 5 parts of a silicone moisture curing catalyst b 0 70 parts of a trimethylsilyl terminated silicone oil and c an effective amount of a photosensitizer. The novel reactive polyorganosiloxanes utilized in the inventive compositions and their method of preparation are also part of the present invention. Detailed Description of The Invention The principal ingredient in the formulations of tile invention are polyorganosiloxanes terminated with acrylic functional dialkoxysilyl or diaryloxysilyl groups. These silicones may be represented by formula 1 EMI3.1 wherein R1 and R2 are organo groups including alkyls, such as methyl, ethyl etc., halo alkyls such as 3,3,3 trifluoropropyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryls such as benzyl or phenyl, and others such as vinyl, methacryloxypropyl, methoxy, mercaptopropyl, hydrogen or benzoin groups R3 is the same or different alkyl or aryl R4 is lI or C15 alkyl R5 is alkylene and n is an integer greater than or equal to 80. Preferably, R1 and R2 are alkyl groups, most preferably methyl. Phenyl groups are also suitable but high phenyl content silicones may excessively absorb UV irradiation, thereby reducing the cure through volume of the initial UV cure. If RÚ and Rê include functional groups capable of crosslinking under the UV or moisture cure conditions, such as vinyl, methacryloxypropyl and methoxy, such groups should not be present in more than 2t by repeat unit. For optimum moisture curing characteristics, R3 will preferably be alkyls which have 3 or less carbon atoms. For optimum heat and hydrolytic stability of the R5 linkage, R is preferably between 3 and about 10 carbon atoms. The number of repeat units in the silicone of formula t must be about 80 or more in order to obtain the desired gel or elastomeric properties in the cured materials.Although n does not have a theoretical limit, it will preferably not exceed 1500. More than 1500 repeat units gives a polymer which is difficult to process, apply and cure. The moisture curing catalysts in the inventive formulation may be any methoxy silicone moisture cure catalyst which does not adversely affect the acrylic e.g. initiating or inhibiting cure of the acrylic group . Preferred moisture catalysts are organotitanate catalysts such as tetraisopropylorthotitanate. The higher the amount of the organotitanate catalyst, the faster the curing speed. Consequently, the moisture cure speed may be tailored as desired. Typically the moisture cure catalyst will be present at a level of 0.1 5 of the amount of reactive silicone of formula 1 . The silicone oils used in the formulations of the invention are trimethylsilyl terminated polydimethyl siloxanes having viscosity between about 100 and 5,000 cps.These oils are employed as plasticizers to control the texture and softness of the cured material and as diluents to adjust the final viscosity of the composition. For electronic potting compositions in which gel like materials are desired, the plasticizing silicone oil should be present in the range of about 30 70 by weight of the composition.Lower amounts of silicon oil produce compositions which yield soft rubbery materials. Amounts of silicone oil in excess of about 70 produce materials which will flow even after curing. The finai ingredient of the inventive compositions is a photosensitizer. Photosensitizers which will initiate curing of the acrylic functionalities are well known in the art. They include benzoin and substituted benzoins, benzophenone, Michler s ketone, dialkoxybenzophenone, diethoxyacetophenone, etc. Any known photosensitizer can be used as well as mixtures thereof, without departing from the invention hereof. Further examples of such photosensitizers may be found in the aforementioned prior patents and in S.P.Pappas, UV Curing Science and Technology , TechnologyMarketing Corp. 1978 . The amount of photosensitizer utilized in the inventive compositions will typically be in the range of .1 5 of the composition. Depending on the characteristics of the particular photosensitizer, however, amounts outside of this range may be employed without departing from the invention hereof so long as they perform the function of rapidly and efficiently initiating polymerization of the acrylic groups. The photosensitizer ingredient may also be polymer bound, e.g. as a portion of the RÚ or Rê groups of the reactive silicone of formula 1 . An example of polymer bound photoinitiators and techniques for producing same may be found in U.S. Patent 4,271,425. Appropriate modifications of such techniques to produce polymer bound silicones having the dialkoxyacrylic functional terminal groups are within the ordinary skill of persons in the silicone synthesis art. The inventive compositions may also contain other additives so long as they do not interfere with the UV and moisture curing mechanisms. These include adhesion promoters such as 2,3 epoxypropyltrimethoxy silane, triallyl S triazine 2,4,6 1H,3 l,5lI trione and others known to those skilled in the art fillers such as silica, microballoon glass, etc. Further examples of fillers usabie to modify the texture of the inventive compositions may be found in U.S. Patent 4,072,635 at Col. 4, line 40 Col. 5, line 7. If the application is for electronic devices, the additives should not include any ionic species. In electronic applications, ion trapping compounds such as crown ethers and cryptates may be useful for reducing ionic conductivity. Examples are 18 crown 6, 12 crown 4 and 15 corwm 5. See also U.S, Patent 4,271,425 where the use of crown ethers in conventional RTV silicone encapsulants is described. The reactive silicones of formula 1 are easily prepared from silanol terminated silicones of formula 2 EMI6.1 where R1 and R2 are defined as in formula 1 . Silanol terminated dimethylsiloxanes of viscosity between about 500cps and 50,000cps will produce reactive silicones within the desired molecular weight range previously specified.For producing soft gel potting compounds silanol terminated dimethylsiloxanes of between about 600cst and 20,000cst are preferred, more preferably between 600cst and 4000cst. Silanols of formula 2 are reacted with silane compositions of formula 3 EMI6.2 where R3, R4 and R5 are also as defined as in formula 1 in the presence of a condensation catalyst such as an organo titanate to produce the reactive silicones of formula 1 .Because of commercial availability and good reactivity of both the alkoxy and the acrylic groups, methacryloxytrimethoxysilane is the preferred compound of formula 3 . The mole ratio of silane to silanol terminated siloxane is between 2 and 6 1 3 moles of trialkoxysilane per equivalent of silanol hydroxyl . Ratios of moles silane 3 to moles silanol 2 which are less than 2 1 produce gelled or taffy like materials which cannot be usefully employed in the inventive compositions. As the molecular weights of the silanol increases, the minimum level of silane has been observed to increase slightly. Thus, a ratio of at least 2.2 1 is recorn rnded when a 28,000MW silanol terminated dimethylsilcxane is used, whereas a level of 2 1 is satisfactory for a 12,000MW silanol terminated dimethylsiloxane. The titanate catalyst is added in an amount of between 0.1 and 5 by weight. The preferred catalyst is tetraisopropanol titanate. The catalyst and reactants are reacted between 100C and 2000C, preferably 600C to 1200C. A vacuum is applied durring or after the reaction to remove substantially all of the theoretical amount of R OH which is liberated from the reaction of the silanol groups of silicone 2 with silane 3 . The silicone oil and photoillitiatcr ingredients of the inventive compositions may be added to the composition before or after the reaction of silicone 2 and silane 3 .After the reaction, the titanate catalyst level may be adjusted to alter the moisture cure characteristics of the composition. The compositions of the invention will typically produce slightly softer materials if moisture cured compared to UV cured samples of the same compositions. The moisture cure is usually complete within 24 72 hours. After UV cure, or completion of moisture cure, the samples do not become noticeably harder on prolonged aging. The actual physical characteristics of the cured products obtained from a given composition will depend on the molecular weight of the reactive silicone of formula 1 as well as on the method of cure employed and the amount of oil. In general, the higher the molecular weight of the reacted silicone the softer the cured product and the slower the cure. With silicones of formula 1 which have a molecular weight above about 35,000, the level of oil above which flowable cured products are produced may be somewhat less than 70 . The following examples are illustrative of the invention.Example 1 In a round bottomed flask 50.0g of a hydroxyl terminated polydiniethylsi loxane of 680cst viscosity 0.3t hydroxyl by weight , 2.629 methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane and 0.21g tetraisopropylorthotitanate were reacted on a rotary evaporator and 10mum Hg pressure and 80 C for two hours. The viscosity of the mixture increased for the first hour and then decreased during the second hour. A full vacuum approximately 0.5mm ling was applied for an additional 4 hours at 80 C. The flask was removed from the evaporator and flushed with nitrogen. The reactive silicone product was a yellow liquid. The product was then used to formulate mixtures with 100cst or 1,000cst trimethylsilyl terminated silicone oils.The mixtures ranged from 0 908 silicone oil. To each of these mixtures was added 2 by weight diethoxyacetophenone as photoinitiator. Samples of these compositions, about 1 4 thick, were then cured by 1 2 minute exposure to UV irradiation of about 70,000 microwattd cmê or by 24 hour moisture cure at ambient temperature and humidity. Above about 70 oil content, curing was very difficult and nonflowable products were not achieved by the moisture cure mechanism. Samples containing between 0 and 70 oil ranged, respectively, from a soft rubbery material Shore A 10 15 to a very soft sticky gel Shore A unmeasurable which showed some tendency to creep but would not flow.Example 2 The synthetic procedure of Example 1 was repeated using 50.0g of a 3500cst hydroxyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane 28,000M.W , 1.05g methacryloxypropyl trimethoxysilane and 0.2or tetraisopropylort iotitanate. The product was a viscous liquid. A sample of the product was mixed with 2 diethoxyacetophenone and cured with UV irradiation of 70,000 microwatts cm2 to a stretchable soft rubber. Another sample of the same composition cured te a slightly softer rubber after 2 1 2 days exposure to ambient temperature and humidity. Example 3 A methacryloxypropyldimethoxysilyl terminated dimethylsiloxane was prepared from 101.7g of a 20,000cst silanol terminated dimethylsiloxane, 2.6g methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane and 0.3g tetraisopropylorthotitanate in a manner similar to that of Exannples 1 and 2 except that 100.9g of a 100cst trimetbylsilyl terminated silicone oil was added to the mixture prior to heating. The resulting product had a viscosity of 21,200cps. 3.05g of the 21,200cps product were then mixed with 0.6g cf the same 100cst silicone oil and 0.07g dimet cxace tophenone. This composition, containing 58 oil, cured to a soft gel 1 16 deep upon exposure to UV of about 70,000 microwatts cm2 for 60 seconds. 193.8g of the 21,200cps product were mixed with 45g of the 100cst silicone oil and 5g dimethoxyacetophenone. The mixture was cast into 1 8 thick open top molds and cured byUV light of the same intensity for six intervals of 20 seconds each, with a cooling period between each interval. The samples were then allowed to moisture cure overnight after which they were removed from the molds in 4 x 4 square pieces, turned over, and the bottom surfaces subjected to three 20 second intervals of UV exposure to reduce tackiness. 4 x 4 pieces were then subjected to electrical testing, the results of which are given in Table I below Table ITest Performed Individual Values Average ValueASTM D 149, Dielectric Strength, volts mil 340 230 210 250 260 260ASTM D 256, VolumeResistivity, 1014 ohm cm 3.8 3.9 4.8 3.5 3.5 3.9ASTM D 150, Dielectric Constant, 10ê Hz 2.87 4.28 3.58 Test Performed Individual Values Average ValueASTM D 150, Dielectric Constant, 105 Hz 2.59 2.83 2.71ASTM D 150, bissipation Factor, 1o2 liz 0.0018 0.0017 0.0018ASTM D 150, Dissipation Factor, 105 Hz 0.0012 0.0012 0.0012
