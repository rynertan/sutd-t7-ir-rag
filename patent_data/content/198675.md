## Description
SELF REGULATING VALVE The present invention relates to an improved valve. More particularly, this invention relates to a valve that opens and closes in response to a change in the physical environment of the valve, and that is especially useful as a relief valve. Furthermore, this invention pertains to a lidded vessel including this improved valve, and to uses of this valve. As exemplified by A. Abu Samra et al., AnalyticalChemistry, 47, 1475 1975 , and P. Barrett et al,,Analytical Chemistry, 7, 1021 1978 , a microwave ovenbased, digestion technique using an acid digesting agent in an open vessel, is known. Barrett et al. report that this procedure decreases digestion time, compared to a hot plate heat source. Also known, as illustrated by Nadkarni, AnalyticalChemistry, 56, 2233 1984 , and S. A. Matthews et al, Bureau of Mines Technical Progress Report 120 April 1983 is a microwave oven based, digestion technique using an acid digesting agent in a closed system. In Nadkarni s procedure, a covered Teflon or polycarbonate beaker was placed in a partially evacuated, closed, glass desiccator so that acid fumes leaking from the covered beaker were trapped within the glass desiccator. A polycarbonate bottle with a polypropylene screw cap was used as a closed digestion vessel by Matthews et al., who cautioned against explosion caused by pressure build up within a closed vessel and observed leaking of some acid fumes around the bottle caps during pressure dissolution.Matthews et al. report that, compared to open vessel digestion, closed vessel digestion prevents the introduction of contaminating elements and the loss of volatile elements and compounds. Accordingly, although closed system digestion has been found to have advantages over open vessel digestion, the containing vessel in a closed system could explode under pressure build up, with spewing of acid. The explosion hazard is enhanced, for example, if, as in tissue digestion, gas is generated by the digestion process. As a result, open vessel digestion is commonly utilized, particularly if the digestion process generates gas. A lidded digestion vessel suitable for use in a microwave system based digestion that employs a corrosive digesting agent, is available from Savillex Corporation either with or without an outlet port in the lid. This lidded vessel is formed of a deformable, resilient, highly chemically inert, thermoplastic material. This material is a fluorocarbon copolymer in which the carbon fluorine backbone in the main chain is connected with perfluoroalkoxy side chains through oxygen links. This fluorocarbon copolymer is marketed by Dupont Corp. under the trademarkTeflon PFA. Prior art valves are exemplified by U.S. Patents 4,474,211 to Lucas, 4,493,444 to Del Bon et al, and 4,400,401 to Beauvais et al. The Del Bon et al patent is directed to a self closing valve and lid assembly. TheLucas patent pertains to a valve that includes a disc like member through which apertures extend, and an aperture closing device having a pressure responsive flex web with openings offset from the apertures The Beauvais et al patent relates to a method using microwave energy for sterilizing and canning food products within a nonmetallic enclosure cover having an aperture controlled by a check valve regulated by a weight. Within the enclosure cover, a non metallic jar with a nonmetallic lid having a vent hole closed by a vent closure, contains the food product. Also known in the prior art is a manually operated, dispensing valve formed by an opening in a metallic can lid top, a resilient rubber insert located inside the lid top and having an outlet port portion that extends through the lid top, and a plastic pin element. The plastic pin element has a disc like part with a raised portion that seats against the rubber insert to close the valve, and has a pin like part that extends through the outlet port portion of the rubber insert for engagement with a nozzle. The valve is opened by finger pressure exerted against the nozzle. Prior work known to us is a beryllium copper spring, needle check valve of Lois B. Jassie and H. M.Kingston. This valve attaches to an outlet port of a closed digestion vessel, as a pressure relief valve for explosion prevention. Because the beryllium copper spring does not absorb microwave radiation, this valve is usable in a microwave system based digestion procedure. However, a drawback is that beryllium is oxidizable, especially in an acid fume environment, to beryllium oxide, which results in the valve no longer being acceptable for use in a microwave system. Moreover, beryllium oxide is carcinogenic. Therefore, there is a need for an improved valve that could be used as a pressure relief valve for explosion prevention in a microwave system based, closed vessel digestion procedure. Such an improved valve would be of enhanced utility if it had a broad range of applications According to the present invention, there is provided a valve responsive to a predetermined internal fluid pressure. The valve includes a dome shaped, pressuredeformable wall member having an outlet port, and an abutment integral with a support member.The abutment has a contact providing, seating surface adapted to surround the outlet port and engaged with an inside surface of the wall member in a tight sealing relationship that mechanically causes the wall member to be dome shaped, and that blocks outflow through the outlet port when internal fluid pressure impinging on the wall member is insufficient to cause an additional outward deformation thereof that overcomes the tight sealing relationship. The wall member is sufficiently pressuredeformable that the force of the predetermined internal fluid pressure acting thereon, causes the additional outward deformation, thereby opening the valve to permit pressure relief through the outlet port. The fluid pressuredeformed, wall member is sufficiently resilient that the wall member re engages in the tight sealing relationship when internal fluid pressure impinging on the wall member becomes less than the predetermined internal fluid pressure, thereby closing the valve. In a preferred embodiment, this valve is sensitive not only to internal fluid pressure but also to temperature. Also according to the present invention, there is a lidded vessel provided with a self opening and selfclosing valve. The valve includes a pressure deformable, resilient wall member having an outlet port, and an obstructing member engaged in a tight sealing relationship with an inside surface of the wall member or with an inner surface of the outlet port. As a result, outflow through the outlet port is blocked when internal fluid pressure impinging on the wall member is insufficient to cause a deformation thereof 20 that overcomes the tight sealing relationship. In addition, there is provided an apparatus that includes a microwave system and the lidded vessel valve combination of the present invention. In a preferred embodiment, the microwave system includes a corrosion resistant chamber, a corrosion resistant exhaust system capable of providing high volume air flow through the chamber, an element for absorbing excess reflected radiation, and a computer controlled variable power source.The lidded vessel is microwave transparent. Also provided is a closed vessel digestion method using the lidded vessel valve combination of the present invention. A sample to be digested is introduced into a container with an amount of a digesting agent suitable for effecting digestion. Afterwards, a self opening and selfclosing valve adapted for functioning as a pressure relief valve at a predetermined internal pressure, is placed over the mouth of the container. The valve includes a pressuredeformable, resilient wall member having an outlet port, and an obstructing element engaged in a tight sealing relationship with an inside surface of the wall member or with an inner surface of the outlet port. Then, the container is tightly closed, and sufficient microwave energy to digest the sample is applied to the contents of the closed container.Afterwards, the application of microwave energy is discontinued, and the digested sample is recovered. In addition, other methods using the lidded vessel valve combination of the present invention are provided. These methods include use in canning, sterilization and fluid dispensing. Reference is now made to the accompanying drawing, which forms a part of the specification of the present invention, and which depicts preferred embodiments of an improved valve in accordance with the present invention and uses of the improved valve.

As explained earlier, the present invention is directed to an improved valve. More particularly, this invention relates to a self regulating valve that opens and closes in response to a change in the physical environment of the valve, in particular to a change in internal fluid pressure. In a preferred embodiment, this improved valve is also temperature sensitive, and therefore able to respond not only to internal fluid pressure but also to temperature change. In this embodiment, the components of the valve can amazingly be made of the same material. Also in this embodiment, the valve is microwave radiation transparent and is therefore useful as a relief valve in a microwave systembased, closed vessel digestion technique, even when the digestion generates gas. In a very preferred embodiment, the improved valve is highly chemically inert and accordingly corrosion resistant.Also in a preferred embodiment, the improved valve of this invention can be manually opened. Also as explained earlier, our invention is directed to a lidded vessel employing this improved valve, to an apparatus including a microwave system and this lidded vessel, and to methods using the improved valve. The term fluid as used in our description of the present invention and in the claims, means a liquid, gas or vapor, and the terms upper , lower , above , below , upward and downward are intended to designate relative orientation of the valve as shown in the Figures. Figures 1, 3 and 4 depict a lidded vessel 10 utilizing a very highly preferred embodiment of a valve 12 in accordance with the present invention. Valve 12 is formed by a disc shaped member 14, and a deformable, resilient top wall 16 of a lid 18 of a hollow receptacle or container 20. Centrally located in the lid is a fluid outlet port 22. Preferably, disc shaped member 14 and the entirety of lidded vessel 10 are formed of a deformable, resilient, thermoplastic material, that is very preferably the same for each of member 14, the lid and the container. Even more preferably, this material is the fluorocarbon copolymer described earlier. Preferably, the cross sectional thickness of disc 14 imparts semi rigidity to the disc. Disc 14 has a peripheral wall surface 24 that conforms to an upper inside wall surface 26 of the lid, and enables the disc to be locked in place between the lid and an upper rim 28 of container 20. Encircling, and spaced apart from, a center 30 of the disc is a raised abutment ring 32 having a peak 34, which provides point contact between the disc and an inner surface 36 of lid top 16. As can best be seen in Figure 1, located between ring 32 and peripheral wall surface 24 are apertures 38, each having a flow area A , defined by a diameter a . With reference to Figure 3, which shows valve 12 in closed position, the abutment ring peak of semi rigid disc 14 pushes against flexibly deformable, lid top 16 so as to cause the lid top to bulge outwardly. Outward bulging of the lid top is seen by comparison to the undistorted lid shown in Figure 2. The point contact provided by the abutment ring peak produces a tight sealing relationship between ring 32 and inner lid top surface 36. Peak 34 is appropriately spaced apart from center 30 of the disc such that it surrounds outlet port 22 of the lid, thereby obstructing flow through the outlet port. The outlet port and abutment ring could be offset from the central assembly axis, provided that they are so located relative to one another in the assembled valve, that the abutment ring peak surrounds the outlet port. As shown in Figures 3 and 4, disc 14 divides lidded vessel 10 into compartments 40 and 42. Apertures 38 permit internal fluid pressure to be equally exerted against lid top 16 and other walls of the lidded vessel. The number of apertures, whether one or many, is not critical rather, the sum of areas A of the apertures should not restrict flow to the cap. So long as the force of the internal fluid pressure acting on lid top 16 is less than or only equal to the pressure of abutment ring 32 against the lid top, valve 12 remains closed. Internal fluid pressure pushing against a central area 43 of a lower disc surface 44, assists the mechanical pressure exerted by the abutment ring to strengthen the tight sealing relationship between peak 34 and inner top surface 36. Hence, the force of internal fluid pressure is utilized to enhance closure of the valve. Central area 43 is defined by a diameter f of the abutment ring peak. A donut shaped area 45, which consists of the area of inner lid top surface 36 outside the abutment ring peak, is conveniently greater than central area 43. Since the lid top is more flexible than the disc, central area 43 could be greater than area 45. If, as illustrated in Figure 4, the force of the internal fluid pressure impinging on lid top 16 should exceed the pressure of abutment ring 32 against the lip top, the lid top is lifted away from sealing contact with abutment ring peak 34, and valve 12 is opened. A gap 46 is created between peak 34 and inner lid top surface 36, through which pressure is released from the lidded vessel, via fluid outlet port 22. When a sufficient reduction in the force of the internal fluid pressure acting on the lid top has occurred, the resiliency of deformable, resilient top wall 16 causes disc 14 and inner lid top surface 36 to reseat in a tight sealing relationship, thereby closing the valve. Should the force of the internal fluid pressure impinging on the lid top again exceed the pressure of the abutment ring against the lip top, valve 12 will reopen, until the fluid pressure within the lidded vessel drops sufficiently for the valve to reclose. Thus, opening and closing of the valve in response to the internal fluid pressure within the lidded vessel, recurs as required. The internal fluid pressure required to open valve 12 is controlled by factors including the height and the diameter of abutment ring peak 34, and the flexibility of the lid top. For example, the greater the height of peak 34, the relatively greater the pressure needed the greater the diameter of the ring peak, the relatively greater the pressure required and the more flexible the lid top, the relatively less pressure needed. Accordingly, by selection for example of an appropriate peak height or ring peak diameter, the valve can be made to open at a predetermined internal pressure. Attention is invited to our later description, which illustrates the relationship between diameter of the ring peak and the internal pressure needed to open valve 12.As described later, valve 12 is responsive not only to internal fluid pressure but also to temperature change. If disc 14 were flexible, rather than semi rigid, the disc would be seen bowed downwardly in Figure 3 and lid top 16 would show less outward bulging. For a constant height of peak 34 and diameter of ring 32, a relatively higher internal pressure would be needed to open valve 12, if the disc were flexible, rather than semi rigid. If, on the other hand, the disc were rigid rather than semi rigid, internal pressure pushing against central area 43 of the lower disc surface would not strengthen the tight sealing relationship between peak 34 and inner top surface 36. When the disc is flexible, the internal pressure required for valve opening is less predictable than when the disc is rigid or semi rigid When used with a lidded vessel, valve 12 is operable regardless whether a small volume of liquid is used, or the lidded vessel is filled to capacity. Advantageously, valve 12 can be manually opened by exerting finger pressure against an outer wall 47 of the outlet port in a direction generally perpendicular to the central assembly axis of the valve. This type of finger pressure will move inner lid top surface 36 out of the tight sealing relationship with the abutment ring peak. Valve 12 can be maintained open by pressure exerted through the outlet port on an upper disc surface 48. Figures 3 and 4 depict lidded vessel 10 containing in phantom, solids 49 and a liquid 50, to which microwave energy is applied by means of a microwave 51, also shown in phantom. Microwave 51 could be the microwave system illustrated in Figure 11. Solids 49 may be, for example, a sample to be digested such as a gas generating tissue sample. In this case, liquid 50 would be a digesting agent such as an acid digesting agent. Solids 49 may also be a food product to be canned using microwave energy, in which case liquid 50 would contain water or solids 49 maybe objects to be sterilized using microwave energy, in which case liquid 50 would include water. To take advantage of the manual release feature of valve 12, lidded vessel 10 could contain a fluid as shown inFigure 11, to which microwave energy is applied to heat the fluid and build up internal pressure for manual release of the warm or hot fluid. Exemplary fluids include, but are not limited to, a gas, a foam, a semi fluid mixture such as a slurry, or a liquid such as a semi solid or an emulsion.Illustrative semi solids include gels and pastes. For example, container 20 could be filled with a suitable shaving cream composition, and the lidded vessel assembled with disc shaped member 14 in place. The contents of the assembled vessel could then be heated by microwave radiation for a desired period of time. The lidded vessel could then be inverted, and valve 12 manually opened to release a warm or hot shaving cream composition. It will be appreciated that the lidded vessel is refillable, as the lid could be removed and additional material could be added to the container for dispensing or discharge. Figures 5 7 show a second preferred embodiment of a valve in accordance with the present invention. Valve 52 is formed by a spider member 54, and a deformable, resilient top wall 56 of a lid 58. Preferably, spider member 54 and the entirety of lid 58 are formed of a deformable, resilient, thermoplastic material, that is very preferably the same formember54 and lid 58. Even more preferably, this material is the fluorocarbon copolymer described earlier. Spider member 54, which is preferably semi rigid, includes a pin part 60 and preferably leg parts 62. Pin part 60 has a stem portion 64 that preferably terminates in an inwardly tapered tip portion 66. Suitably, approximately the last 2.5 mm of the stem portion are tapered. A fluid outlet port 68 is conveniently centrally located in lid 58. An inner surface 70 of the outlet port conforms to a peripheral wall surface 72 of stem portion 64.Preferably, the stem portion is cylindrically shaped.Peripheral wall surface 72 of the stem portion fits snugly against the inner surface of the outlet port to provide a tight sealing relationship. Preferably, the tip portion of the pin part has an inward taper of about 2 3 . This angle of taper provides for slow, controlled pressure release through the valve, and furthermore assists reseating of the pin part in the outlet port, during valve closing. When valve 52 is used with, for example, a receptacle 74, the receptacle is advantageously provided with an inner lip 76 that preferably is continuous. The inner lip provides support to the spider member that is particularly beneficial when the valve is open, as shown inFigure 6. When the valve is open, inner lip 76 allows the free floating spider member to be self centering, as the stem portion is able to seek a tight sealing relationship with the inner surface of the outlet port. So long as the force of the internal fluid pressure acting on lid top 56 is insufficient to overcome the tight sealing relationship provided by the friction fit between the stem portion and the outlet port, valve 52 remains closed, as illustrated in Figure 5. If, as shown inFigure 6, the force of the internal pressure impinging on the lid top should be sufficient to overcome the tight sealing relationship, the valve is opened. Fluid pressure is released through a gap 78 and then from the lidded vessel via the outlet port. Leg parts 62 of the spider member prevent expulsion of pin part 60 through the outlet port. The release of fluid pressure through port 68 reduces the pressure within the lidded vessel. After sufficient pressure has been released, the resiliency of deformable, resilient top wall 56 of the lid assists reseating of the spider member and the outlet port in a tight sealing relationship, thereby closing the valve. The valve will reopen and reclose as necessary in response to internal fluid pressure within the lidded vessel. The internal pressure required to open valve 52 may be controlled by the height of stem portion 64. More specifically, the greater the height of the stem portion, the relatively greater the internal pressure needed, whereas a shorter stem portion requires relatively less internal pressure. Accordingly, the valve can be made to open at a predetermined internal pressure by selecting an appropriate height for the stem portion. Similar to valve 12, valve 52 is operable in conjunction with a lidded vessel, regardless whether a small volume of liquid is used or the lidded vessel is filled to capacity. It will be noted that the fluid pressure opening valve 12 is in the same upward direction as the mechanical pressure being exerted on deformable lid top 16. Figures 8 10 show a third embodiment of a valve in accordance with the present invention. Valve 132 is formed by a disc with integral pin member 134, and a deformable, resilient wall 136 of a cap 138. Preferably, member 134 and the entirety of cap 138 are formed of a deformable, resilient, thermoplastic material, that is very preferably the same for member 134 and cap 138. Even more preferably, this material is the fluorocarbon copolymer described earlier. Member 134, which is preferably semi rigid, includes a pin part 140 and preferably a disc part 142. The pin part has a stem portion 144 that preferably terminates in an inwardly tapered tip portion 146. Suitably, the last approximately 2.5 mm are tapered. Preferably, the angle of inward taper is about 2 3 . This angle of taper provides for slow, controlled pressure release through the valve. A fluid outlet port 148 is conveniently centrally located in cap 138. An inner surface 150 of the outlet port conforms to a peripheral wall surface 152 of the stem portion of the pin part. Preferably, stem portion 144 is cylindrically shaped. The peripheral wall surface of the stem portion fits snugly against the inner surface of the outlet port to provide a tight sealing relationship. Disc part 142 preferably has a peripheral wall surface 154 that conforms to an upper inside wall surface 156 of the cap, and thereby enables the disc part to be retained between the cap and a rim 158 of a hose or conduit 160. The conduit may be flexible, semi rigid or rigid. As shown in Figure 10, located between pin part 140 and the disc peripheral wall surface are apertures 162, each having a flow area B , defined by a diameter b . The four apertures enable the internal fluid pressure to be exerted against pressure deformable wall 136 of the cap.The number of apertures to achieve this end is not critical rather, the sum of areas B of the apertures should not restrict flow through the cap. So long as the force of internal fluid pressure acting on cap wall 136 is insufficient to overcome the tight sealing relationship provided by the friction fit between the pin part and the outlet port, valve 132 remains closed, as illustrated in Figure 8. If, as shown in Figure 9, the force of the internal fluid pressure on cap wall 136 should be sufficient to overcome the tight sealing relationship, the valve is opened. A gap 164 is created through which pressure is released via the outlet port. Pressure release continues as long as the internal fluid pressure being exerted against cap wall 136 is sufficient to keep the valve open. However, once fluid pressure decreases sufficiently, the resiliency of deformable, resilient wall 136 of the cap effects reseating of pin part 140 and the outlet port in the tight sealing relationship, thereby closing valve 132. The valve reopens and recloses in response to the internal fluid pressure acting on cap wall 136. The internal pressure required to open valve 132 may be controlled by the height of stem portion 144. More specifically, the greater the height of the stem portion, the relatively greater the internal pressure needed, whereas a shorter stem portion requires relatively less internal pressure. Accordingly, the valve can be made to open at a predetermined internal pressure by selecting an appropriate height for the stem portion. In the embodiment just described, use of a valve in accordance with the present invention other than in a lidded vessel, has been illustrated. In this embodiment, a fluid may be passed through the conduit from a remote or relatively close storage source, and discharged, ejected, or dispensed through the valve as needed or desired. It will be appreciated that member 134 of valve 132 could be interchanged with disc member 14 of valve 12, and that therefore either of these valves could be used with a lidded vessel or a conduit. Preferably, the same material is used to form all components of our improved valve. As a result, one valve component will not become hotter than another valve component. The containers of the lidded vessels of Figures 1 and 3 6 are preferably formed of the same material as the pressure deformable wall member, which results in a vesselprotecting effect. However, in some applications, a valve in accordance with the present invention is used with a container formed of a different material. For example, the valve could be formed of thermoplastic components, but the container could be formed of glass. For use in a microwave system, the improved valve of the present invention should be microwave radiation transparent. This characteristic is achieved if the valve is made of a microwave transparent, thermoplastic material.Preferably, the same material is used to form all valve components. Exemplary microwave transparent, thermoplastic materials include, but are not limited to, polypropylene, polyethylene, polypropylene polyethylene copolymers, and the fluorocarbon copolymer described earlier. The fluorodarbon copolymer advantageously provides a high temperature, corrosion resistant valve. As later described in more detail, a valve in accordance with the present invention is temperature sensitive when the pressure deformable wall member thereof is made of a thermoplastic material. Illustrative thermoplastic materials for providing a temperature sensitive valve include those just described.Advantageously, a useful thermoplastic material is moldable and precision machinable. An eminently useful microwave system for digestion procedures is characterized by a corrosion resistant interior chamber, a corrosion resistant exhaust system capable of providing high volume air flow through the chamber, means for absorbing excess reflected radiation, and a computer controlled variable power source. A microwave system of this type is commercially available under the trademark MDS 81 from CEM Corporation, Matthews, NorthCarolina. The MDS 81 microwave system is later described in more detail. Further details of the present invention are now provided based on trials carried out in an MDS 81 microwave system, using a valve in accordance with the present invention as a relief valve for a lidded digestion vessel obtained from Savillex Corporation. Water is added to the vessel, the lid of which is provided with a vent port, and the lidded vessel is assembled with semi rigid, disc shaped member 14 in place, to form valve 12. Member 14, which is made of the thermoplastic fluorocarbon copolymer described earlier, has an abutment ring peak that is 1.57 mm high, and four apertures equally spaced around the abutment ring, each with a diameter of 3 mm. The lower disc surface has a diameter of 39 mm. When the diameter of the abutment ring peak is 13 mm, this valve opens at about 410 kPa internal pressure.In comparison, if the diameter across the ring peak is 16 mm, the valve opens at approximately 550 kPa internal pressure, and if the ring peak diameter is 19 mm, the valve opens at about 650 kPa internal pressure. A valve in accordance with the present invention in which the pressure deformable, resilient wall member is made of a thermoplastic material, is not only pressure sensitive but also temperature sensitive as the temperature of the pressure deformable wall member increases, elasticity of the material thereof increases, and the valve opens at a relatively lower pressure. For example, as just described, when the disc of valve 12 has a ring peak diameter of 13 mm, the valve opens at about 410 kPa for water. In this instance, vapors within the lidded vessel, result in top wall 16 of the lid being at a temperature ofapproximately 1500 C. In contrast, if a liquid were used having a boiling point appropriate for producing a lid top temperature of about 60 C, the valve would open at approximately 760 kPa internal pressure. When using valve 12 for closed vessel digestions, the manual opening feature of the valve makes it possible to check for high pressure within the closed vessel, prior to opening the closed vessel to remove a digested sample. In carrying out a closed vessel digestion, it will generally be undesirable for the relief valve to open, as digesting agent fumes may escape. However, when the digestion generates a gas, opening and reclosing of the valve will be beneficial. A trial of valve 52 as a relief valve for theSavillex lidded digestion vessel, is now described. Water is added to the vessel, and the lidded vessel is assembled with semi rigid, spider member 54, made of the thermoplastic, fluorocarbon copolymer described earlier, in place. The stem portion of the integral pin part of member 54, has a height of 6 mm, and the tip portion of the pin part tapers inwardly at an angle of 2 and is 3 mm high. The lidded vessel is placed within an MDS 81 microwave system, and application of microwave energy is begun. When top wall 56 of the lid is at a temperature of approximately 1500 C, the valve opens at about 550 kPa internal pressure. As can be seen, a valve in accordance with the present invention, is capable of containing a high pressure, that is, a pressure of more than 340 kPa. Accordingly, the improved valve makes possible a closed vessel digestion at high pressure, with the strength of the lidded vessel walls being an important limitation on the internal pressure. For example, we experienced a blowout of a bottom wall of a Savillex lidded digestion vessel at about 1000 kPa.In contrast, the prior art, closed vessel digestion procedures described earlier, experienced leakage at considerably lower pressures. High pressure digestions should further reduce digestion time. A thermoplastic lidded vessel such as vessel 10 may be heat treated to reduce deformability of the walls thereof. Heat treating or annealing is carried out at an appropriate temperature for a suitable period of time to obtain walls having the desired reduced deformability. For example, lidded vessel 10 could be heated at about 200 C for about 72 hours. Figure 11 illustrates an MDS 81 microwave system in detail, and shows the use of this microwave system with lidded vessel 10, which contains a fluid 178 for manual dispensing. Microwave system 180 includes an internal chamber 182 formed by a floor 184, sidewalls 186, a ceiling not shown , and a door 188. The inner surface of each of these internal chamber forming components is corrosion resistant, for example, coated with a fluorocarbon resin such as Teflon A conventional magnetron 190 is conveniently located outside of the internal chamber, and a wave guide 192 is employed to direct the microwave radiation into the internal chamber. The magnetron is controllable within the limits of 0 to 100 percent power input, suitably in one percentage point increments.A radiation mixer 194 for mixing and dispersing the radiation, is advantageously positioned between the magnetron and the internal chamber, to reduce the production of hot spots, which could decompose or destroy part of a sample in the internal chamber. Between the magnetron and the internal chamber, a radiation isolator 196 is advantageously located in the wave guide, for absorbing excess reflected radiation to prevent damaging reflection back to the magnetron. Isolator 196 includes magnetic shapes coupled with heat sinks. The isolator permits originating microwaves emitted from the magnetron to pass through unaffected, but absorbs reflected waves. In fact, the isolator has a propensity for attracting reflected radiation and thus will tend to draw reflected radiation out of the internal chamber. The isolator converts the reflected radiation to heat, which is dissipated through an isolator heat exchanger 198. A heat exchanger duct 200 communicates with the heat exchanger and a fan 202, which draws off the produced heat.Fan 202 and the isolator are able to absorb the full capacity of reflected energy for a zero load, i.e., an empty internal chamber, for prolonged, indefinite operation. Zero load operation enables microwave energy to be rapidly and effectively concentrated on any given sample size, even a sample having a small mass of polar material present. Total drying can be effected without damage to the magnetron and without a competing radiation absorber being present in the internal chamber. As an alternative to isolator 196, a competing radiation absorbing material such as water, could be circulated through the internal chamber in radiation transparent tubing For example, a loop of radiation transparent tubing could be conveyed through the internal chamber flooring or sidewalls from a reservoir. The temperature rise created by the absorption of radiation would effect circulation of the water through the tubing from the reservoir. A drawback of this approach is that a radiation absorber competes for radiation energy in the chamber, which can defeat heating of a small sample to near total dryness due to preferential absorption of the radiation by the larger mass of the radiation absorber. A corrosion resistant, exhaust fan 204 is provided for removal of vapors from the internal chamber. An air intake panel 206 provides for flow of air into the chamber.As the volume of air flow through the internal chamber is important in certain applications of microwave system 180, the exhaust fan is advantageously a variable speed fan. The fan is capable of providing high volume air flow through the chamber. By high volume air flow is meant on the order of 100 scfm or higher. The magnetron power input, duration of power input, and exhaust fan are advantageously computercontrolled, as selectively programmed prior to operation.For this purpose, microwave system 180 has a control panel 208, a numerical input panel 210 and a digital readout panel 212. Additional details concerning the MDS 81 microwave system are set forth in an MDS 81 users manual, revisedMarch 1985, available from CEM Corporation. As described earlier with reference to Figures 3 and 4, the self regulating valve of the present invention can be used with a microwave system, not only for digesting a sample but also for home canning and sterilizing an object. A preferred method of use of an improved valve in accordance with the present invention, for closed vessel digestion is now described with reference to Figures 3 and 4. Lidded vessel 10 is used with, for example, disc shaped member 14. Lid 18 is advantageously formed of a thermoplastic material, as a result of which valve 12 is responsive to pressure and temperature. The diameter of the abutment ring peak of member 14 is of appropriate size to cause the valve to open as a pressure relief valve, at a predetermined internal pressure and temperature suitable for the particular closed vessel digestion to be carried out. A tissue sample 49 such as oyster tissue, and a suitable amount of a liquid digesting agent 50 such as a 50 1 mixture of concentrated nitric acid and hydrofluoric acid, are introduced into container 20. Member 14 is positioned on the mouth of the container, and the container is tightly closed using lid 18. The amount of the liquid digesting agent depends on the sample size. The tightly closed jar is placed into internal chamber 182 of the MDS 81 microwave system, and microwave energy is applied thereto. Digestion of the tissue sample generates gas. At the predetermined internal pressure and temperature, valve 12 opens to release the gas generated, acid fumes and vapors. After sufficient internal pressure has been relieved, the valve closes. The valve then reopens and recloses as necessary, in response to the internal pressure and temperature. When the digestion is complete, microwave energy is no longer applied, and the digested sample containing lidded vessel is removed from the internal chamber. A preferred method of use of an improved valve in accordance with the present invention, in home canning, is now described. In this method, a conventional glass canning jar could be utilized with lid 18 and, for example, discshaped member 14, which are appropriately dimensioned for use with the glass jar. The lid is advantageously formed of a thermoplastic material, as a result of which valve 12 is responsive to pressure and temperature. The diameter of the abutment ring peak of member 14 is of appropriate size to cause valve 12 to open at a predetermined pressure and temperature suitable for home canning. A food product to be canned and a small amount of a liquid such as water, are introduced into the glass jar, member 14 is positioned on the mouth of the jar, and the jar is tightly closed using lid 18. The liquid could be an aqueous solution or juices from the food product. The tightly closed jar is placed into an internal chamber of a conventional microwave appliance or of the MDS81 microwave system, and microwave energy is applied thereto. A portion of the water is vaporized into steam, which passes up through the food product to assist in sterilization of the food product, and builds up pressure within the closed jar. At the predetermined pressure and temperature, valve 12 opens and the steam escapes through the valve, expelling air from within the closed jar. The liquid contains sufficient water, upon being converted to steam, to assist in the sterilization and to expel the air. After steam has escaped through the valve for a suitable period of time, microwave energy is no longer applied, and the jar is removed from the internal chamber for cooling. At an appropriate internal pressure and temperature, valve 12 closes, without inflow of air into the jar. Further cooling occurs to form a vacuum within the lidded jar. When it is desired to eat the canned food product, valve 12 is manually opened to break the vacuum, the lid is unscrewed and removed, and member 14 is removed. The lid, member 14, and the glass jar may then be reused. An improved valve in accordance with the present invention, is similarly used for sterilizing an object.Following the procedure just described for home canning, tweezers to be sterilized are put into the glass canning jar, with a small quantity of a water containing liquid.The diameter of the abutment ring peak of member 14 is of appropriate size to cause valve 12 to open at a predetermined internal pressure and temperature suitable for sterilization. The tightly closed jar is placed into internal chamber 182 of the MDS 81 microwave system, which is unaffected by the introduction of a metal object into the internal chamber thereof. The liquid contains sufficient water, upon being converted to steam, to assist in the sterilization and to expel the air. After sterilization is completed, sterile air may be drawn into the jar through manually opened valve 12 if it is desired to break the vacuum prior to use of the tweezers. The self regulating valve of the present invention can be also used with a microwave system for enabling chemical starting materials to be reacted at a desired pressure and temperature, and dispensing or discharging the reaction product at a desired temperature or for simply dispensing or discharging a fluid at a desired temperature.Exemplary fluids include, but are not limited to, a gas, a foam, a semi fluid mixture such as a slurry, or a liquid such as a semi solid or an emulsion. Illustrative semisolids include gels and pastes. Use of the valve for dispensing or discharging a fluid at a desired temperature avoids the need for temperature sensing devices and related temperature actuated devices. Figure 12 schematically illustrates the use of a valve in accordance with the present invention, for enabling fluids 228 and 230 to be reacted or combined at a desired pressure and temperature, and discharging the resulting product at a desired temperature. The fluids are depicted in the Figure with a dotted line representing the interface of the two fluids. Fluids 228 and 230 could be, for example, two liquid chemical starting materials or two immiscible liquids. In Figure 12, receptacle 20 and lid 58 are employed with, for example, spider member 54 not shown .The lid is formed of a thermoplastic material, as a result of which valve 52 not shown is responsive to pressure and temperature. The height of stem portion 64 not shown is appropriate to cause the internal pressure to increase to the desired pressure for reaction or combination to occur, and to cause the valve to discharge the resulting product at the desired temperature. For purposes of illustration, Figure 12 is further described for two liquid chemical starting materials 228 and 230, unreactive at atmospheric pressure but reactive at a certain pressure in excess of atmospheric pressure. These liquids are added to receptacle 20, and a lidded vessel 232 is assembled with the spider member in place. A hose 234 is attached to the outlet port not shown of the lid, and the assembled apparatus is inverted and placed onto a holder 236 located in an internal chamber 238 of a microwave system 240. The hose is passed through an opening in an exterior wall 244 of the microwave system, and fed into a reaction flask 246 containing a liquid chemical 248 for reaction with the reaction product. Microwave energy is applied to the starting materials, and vaporization occurs to produce a sufficient pressure for the starting materials to react. At a predetermined temperature, valve 52 opens to discharge the reaction product from the lidded vessel into the reaction flask for reaction with liquid chemical 248 at the desired temperature Alternativeiy, two immiscible liquids 228 and 230 that form an emulsion at a pressure in excess of atmospheric pressure, could be introduced into lidded vessel 232, to be discharged at a predetermined temperature as an emulsion. In this instance, the stem portion of the spider member would have an appropriate height for allowing sufficient pressure build up to effect emulsification, prior to the valve discharging the emulsion. Also, fluids 228 and 230 could represent water and air, for providing instant steam. This is achieved by placing water into lidded vessel 232, and using the valve to discharge superheated water, which would convert to steam at atmospheric pressure. In this example, the stem portion would be an appropriate height for allowing sufficient pressure and temperature build up for discharge of superheated water. If it were desired to discharge or dispense a gas or a vapor at a desired temperature using lidded vessel 232, inversion of the lidded vessel would not be necessary. The manual release feature of, for example, valve 12 may also be used for discharging, for purposes of illustration, a pressurized fluid such as grease, from a hose or conduit, on one end of which disc shaped member 14 and a closure element are in place.
