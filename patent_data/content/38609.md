# Preparation of 2 hydroxytetrahydrofuran.

## Abstract
The invention concerns an improved process for the con version of allyl alcohol with hydrogen and carbon monoxide to form a reaction mixture containing 2 hydroxytetrahydrofuran and or 4 hydroxybutyraldehyde. Allyl alcohol, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide are passed continuously in a gaseous phase, into contact with a catalyst comprised of a solid porous carrier material containing within its pores a solution of a catalytically active metallorganic complex dissolved in at least one ligand forming compound, which solution has a vapor pressure of less than 1.3 mbar under the reaction conditions applied.
