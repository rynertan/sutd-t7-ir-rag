# Signal processing for optical image sensor.

## Abstract
A circuit and method for converting signals from a photoelectric image sensor into digital signals containing information as to a characteristic of the sensor signals. The photoelectric image sensor provides output pulses having characteristic determined by the manner in which light is incident thereon and this, in turn, is determined by a light influencing medium in an optical path between a light source and the image sensor. In particular, the peak amplitude of each signal from the sensor is determined and then con verted into a digital signal containing information as to the peak amplitude. This is accomplished by detecting the rise of each sensor signal to a peak amplitude and then holding a signal level corresponding to the peak level of the sensor signal as the sensor signal falls in amplitude for a time at least equal to the time for acquiring or converting into the digital signal. In particular, there is provided a peak detector circuit operatively connected to the photoelectric image sensor for detecting the peak amplitudes of signals obtained from the sensor and an analog to digital converter con nected to the peak detector circuit for providing digital signals containing information as to peak amplitudes of the sensor signals. The peak detector circuit comprises a portion responsive to the rise of each sensor signal to a peak amplitude and a portion for holding a signal level corres ponding to the peak level of each sensor signal as the sensor signal falls in amplitude for a time at least equal to the acquisition time or conversion time of the analog to digital converter.
