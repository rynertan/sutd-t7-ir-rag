## Description
ACTIVE PIN CONTACT This invention relates to electrical contacts and more particularly to active pin contacts for electrical connection with socket contacts. Electrical connectors using matable pins and sockets have been extensively used. These electrical connectors are typically high density whereby a large number of matable pins and sockets are mounted in connector housings of the electrical connectors and electrical connection is effected by matable engagement between the pins and sockets and their respective housings. In this connection, the integrity of the electrical connection between the respective matable pins and sockets and the forces of insertion of the pins within the sockets during mating engagement are important factors to assure effective electrical connections. Use of active pin contacts can assure such effective electrical connections when matably connected with respective socket contacts. In French Publication No. 2 518 829 published June 24, 1983, it is known to provide a hollow active pin contact with a spring member therewithin, a bowed contact section of which extends outwardly from a forward pin contact section through a longitudinal slot, to engage an inside Contact surface of a mating socket barrel, which spring biases the spring member inward against the inside surface of the hollow forward pin contact section to establish normal contact force between the pin contact and the socket contact. In the known active pin, a front arcuate section of the spring member moves frictionally forwardly under spring bias into the nose portion of the hollow contact.The rearward linear section of the spring member is said to be anchored against the inside surface of the hollow pin contact section by a dimple. According to the pr sent invention, an active electrical pin contact comprises a hollow contact having a pin contact section at one end having a longitudinal gap therein, a conductor carrying section at the other end and a spring engagement section therebetween. A spring member is disposed in the hollow contact and it includes a rear section, a bowed section, a short front section, and a long flexing section intermediate the rear section and the bowed section. The rear section and the short front section both extend along inside surfaces of the hollow contact, and the bowed section is disposed in the pin contact section and includes a contact engaging section extending outwardly through the longitudinal gap beyond an outside surface of the hollow pin contact section.The hollow contact also includes an enlarged relief section intermediate the pin contact section and the rearward conductor carrying section and associated with the long flexing section of the spring member such that the spring member may flex within the relief section when an inward force is exerted on the contact engaging section when the active pin contact has been assembled into a contact carrying housing assembly and is being interconnected with a socket contact in a socket contact housing assembly. According to another aspect of the present invention, the rear section of the spring member is anchored against the inside surface of the spring engagement section of the hollow contact intermediate the relief section and the conductor carrying section. Figure 1 is a perspective view of blanks of an active pin contact prior to being formed into active pin contacts. Figure 2 is a perspective view of a formed active pin contact with a spring member exploded therefrom. Figure 3 is a cross sectional view showing a completely formed active pin contact with a spring member secured in place therein. Figure 4 is a cross sectional view of mated electrical connector housings, terminated pin and socket contacts therein, and metal shells therearound. Figure 1 illustrates blanks 12 on carrier strip 14 which have been stamped from a suitable metal strip such as brass or the like. Blanks 12 outline the pin contact prior to being formed as illustrated in Figure 2 wherein the hollow contact 15 includes a pin contact section 16, a relief section 18, a stop section 22 within relief section 18, a spring engagement section 24 and a conductor connector section 26. Edges 28 of hollow contact 15 are spaced from each other as illustrated in Figure 2 thereby forming a longitudinal gap 36 extending from the rounded nose portion 30, along pin contact section 16, along relief section 18 and stop section 22, and along spring engagement section 24. Stop section 22 has a forward stop surface 21 and a rearward stop surface 23. After blanks 12 have been formed into hollow pin contacts 15 as shown in Figure 2 and with the formed hollow contacts 15 still connected to carrier strip 14, they are preferably nickel underplated and then gold plated. A spring member 40 is formed from beryllium copper wire or like metal and includes a rear section 42, a long flexing section 44, a bowed section 46, and a short front section 48. Rear section 42 is preferably linear. As shown in Figure 2, hollow contact 15 is formed with edges 28 spaced from each other to form a longitudinal gap 36 slightly wider than spring member 40 to enable spring member 40 either to be inserted therethrough along the length of hollow contact 15 or, more preferably for efficiency in manufacturing to be inserted axially from rearward the hollow contact 15 such that short front section 48 of the spring member 40 may slide along the inside surface of hollow contact 15 towards and into the nose portion 30, and bowed section 46 follows partially extending outwardly beyond the outer surface of the hollow contact 15 through the longitudinal gap 36.It is preferred that a pinch crimp 38 be formed along spring engagement section 24 and toward the rear thereof as shown in Figures 3 and 4 by pinching together the two sides of spring engagement section 24 above rear section 42 of spring member 40 and firmly therearound thereby anchoring rear section 42 of spring member 40 against the inside surface 32 of spring engagement section 24. This anchoring assists during and after manufacturing by preventing spring member 40 from inadvertently becoming dislodged from hollow contact 15. With spring member 40 anchored in position in spring engagement section 24, bowed section 46 of spring member 40 is disposed within longitudinal gap 36 near the front thereof and a part of bowed section 46 extends outwardly beyond the outer surface of pin contact section 16 thereby defining a contact engaging section. After inserting and anchoring spring member 40 into hollow contact 15 creating active pin contact 10 as illustrated in Figure 3, conductor 50 of insulated electrical conductor 52 is terminated in conductor connecting section 26 the particular open barrel configuration of conductor carrying section 26 of active pin contact 10 as illustrated allows for a conventional F l crimp, which is described more particularly in U.S. Patent No. 2,600,012 After termination, the active pin contact 10 will be assembled in a pin terminal housing assembly 100. This pin terminal housing assembly 100 will then be mated or interconnected with a corresponding socket terminal housing assembly 200 to form a mated connection, all as is described more completely hereinbelow. During this mating process an inside surface of a corresponding socket contact 210 will slide over, and exert an inward force onto, the contact engaging section of bowed section 46 of spring member 40, which will flex the long flexing section 44 of spring member 40. It is preferred that the contact engaging section of bowed section 46 of spring member 40 be substantially forward in pin contact section 76, so that electrical contact with socket contact 210 occurs early in the mating process. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, relief section 18 of active pin contact 10 is circumferential around active pin contact 10 except at longitudinal gap 361 and has a general outer diameter greater than the outer diameter of pin contact section 16 and of spring engagement section 24 thereby defining a general inside surface including that portion of the inside surface of the contact 10 towards which the spring member s long flexing section 44 flexes which is farther from the central axis of the active pin contact 10 than inside surface 32 of spring engagement section 24. Stop section 22, located within relief section 18, has an outer diameter still greater than the general outer diameter of relief section 18.A relief engagement surface 20 may be located within relief section 18 approximately one third the distance from the forward end of spring engagement section 24 of active pin contact 10 to the bowed section 46 of the spring member 40. This relief engagement surface 20 may be closer to the axis of active pin contact 10 than the general inside surface of the relief section 18 but to prevent interference with the flexing of spring member 40, should be farther from the axis than the inner surface of pin contact section 16 and especially farther than inside surface 32 of spring contact section 24 on the side of active pin contact 10 towards which long flexing section 44 of spring member 40 flexes opposite longitudinal gap 36 .Thus relief engagement surface 20 would be the first surface, if any, contacted by the long flexing section 44 of spring member 40 when it is flexed by reason of the inward force applied to bowed section 46 by socket contact 210 in socket terminal housing assembly 200 when pin terminal housing assembly 100 is interconnected therewith as hereinbelow described. Between relief engagement surface 20 and pin contact section 16 a portion of relief section 18 would allow additional flexing of spring member 40 forward of that location where contacting would first occur between relief engagement surface 20 and long flexing section 44 of spring member 40. It is also preferred that short front section 48 of spring member 40 be curved in a direction reverse to that of bowed section 46 it assists in insertion of spring member 40 into the formed hollow contact 15 by allowing ease of sliding along the inside surface of the contact it allows a smoother fit of the front of spring member 40 in the nose portion 30 of pin contact 16 after insertion which is of value when the terminated active pin contact 10 has been assembled into pin terminal housing assembly 100 and is being interconnected with socket terminal housing assembly 200 as hereinbelow described. As shown in Figure 4, a pin contact assembly 100 is formed when a plurality of active pin contacts 10 are inserted into housing members 54, 68. Each active pin contact 10, already terminated to a conductor 50 of an insulated electrical conductor 52, is inserted into a corresponding cavity 78 from the rear surface of a rear housing member 68 which has already been secured to a contact carrying member 54 such as by means of forward and rear metal shell portions 82 and 84, and which assembly already contains a metal spring clip 62 disposed within an enlarged section 58 of contact receiving cavity 56.When forward stop surface 21 of active pin contact 10 engages stop surface 60 at the forward end of enlarged section 58 of cavity 56, forward ends 66 of barbs 64 of metal spring clip 62 will have attained their normal bias towards the axis of cavity 56 and be ready to stoppingly engage rearward stop surface 23 of active pin contact 10 should rearward movement of active pin contact 10 be urged. Pin contact section 16 of active pin contact 10 is now fully disposed within that portion of cavity 56 contained within a plug portion 96 of contact carrying member 54. In the particular contact carrying assembly hereinabove described, no adhesive material or potting compound was needed. A socket contact 210 stamped and formed similarly to hollow contact 15 and from similar materials has already been terminated to a conductor 250 of an insulated electrical conductor 252 and inserted into a socket terminal housing assembly 200.Socket contact 210 preferably has a barrel shaped section 216 at the front thereof which is circumferentially continuous at least at the top thereof if a seam exists in socket contact 210, it should be closed to prevent a gap at the point of contact with contact engaging section of active pin contact 10. A dielectric socket carrying member 254 has a cavity 256 into which terminated socket contact 210 is inserted and is retained therein similarly to active pin contact 10 in housing members 54, 68.Barrel shaped section 216 of socket contact 210 has a configuration selected such that it is insertable in cavity 56 of contact carrying member 54 and just over pin contact section 16 of active pin contact 10 but has a length dimension such that it does not extend to relief section 18 or stop surface 21 of active pin contact 10 when fully mated. As illustrated in Figure 4, the interconnection of pin contact section 16 with barrel shaped section 216 of a socket contact 210 causes the contact engaging section of bowed section 46 of spring member 40 to be engaged by an inside surface of barrel shaped section 216 of socket contact 210 which causes pin contact section 16 to wipingly move along socket contact 210 by virtue of the spring force exerted by spring member 40. The corresponding inward force applied to bowed section 46 by socket contact 210 causes long flexing section 44 of spring member 40 to flex downward toward and into the relief area provided by relief section 18 of the hollow contact.Since the inner surface of this portion of the active pin contact 10 is farther from the central axis of the contact than inside surface 32 of spring engagement section 24 which is engaged by rear section 42 of spring member 40, substantial flexing is permitted.Rear section 42 is secured against inside surface 32 by pinch crimp 38 and is further secured by being terminated with electrical conductor 50 and then crimped in conductor connecting section 26 of active pin contact 10. It is believed that, while preferred, such securing need not absolutely prevent axial movement of rear section 42 of spring member 40 for the operation of the present invention. Similarly, some axial movement may allowably occur by short front section 48 of spring member 40 along the inside surface of pin contact section 16 until short front section 48 becomes snugly lodged inside nose portion 30, and thus it is preferable that the short front section 48 be shaped to conform to the inside surface of the pin contact section 16 at nose portion 30. The insertion forces can be rather significant as the density of the active pin contacts 10 and socket contacts 210 increase in a connector. The configuration of spring members 40 and the operational characteristics thereof enable pin contact sections 16 to electrically engage socket contacts 210 in an effective manner and the insertion forces are reduced when interconnection takes place. Particularly, the long flexing section 44 of spring member 40 reduces localized stress of spring member 40 and thereby enhances the long term effective life of active pin contact 10.
