# Photographic copier image contrast control.

## Abstract
A thermally developed photographic copier is provided having two controls, one for adjusting the contrast, or blackness, of an image, and another for adjusting background contrast. A microprocessor samples and processes the settings of these controls to produce a video pedestal determined by the background contrast control, and a gain control signal adjusted for effects of the background contrast setting to keep amplified video signas within the dynamic range necessary for the image contrast setting. Video signals used to expose light sensitive paper or film are amplified in accordance with the gain control signal and combined with the video pedestal for desired background contrast. The system can automatically modify the gain and video pedestal levels for different lots of paper or film by recording a calibrated grey scale, scanning the recorded grey scale image, comparing the scanned image with previously stored information on the desired image, and modifying the gain and pedestal values as necessary to reproduce images of the desired appearance.
