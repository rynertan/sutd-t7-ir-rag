# Industrial robot.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an industrial robot of the kind comprising a body 3 and an arm system 6, 8 pivotally journalled thereon. In order to achieve an improved and ex tended working range in a vertical space underneath or above the robot, the arm system is supported in the body via a substantially fork shaped bearing bracket 5 , the linear drive means 12, 13 intended for the operation of the arms being pivotally journalled in the bearing bracket 5 so that, when the arm system 6, 8 assumes a neutral position, said drive means will be oriented primarily transversely to the longitudinal axis of the body 3 and substantially parallel with the first arm 6 pivotally journalled in the bearing bracket.
