# Explosives.

## Abstract
Cap sensitive explosives are disclosed which include, as a density reducing agent, small, hollow, dispersed spheres, for example of glass, having a strength such that a maximum of about 10 by volume collapse under a pressure of 500 psi 35 kg cmÂ² . The explosive may be an aqueous slurry explo sive, but preferably the explosive is a water in oil emulsion explosive comprising a water immiscible liquid organic fuel as a continuous phase, an emulsified aqueous inorganic oxid izer salt solution as a discontinuous phase, an emulsifier, and as a density reducing agent, the above mentioned small, hol low, dispersed spheres. Such explosives are resistant to dead pressing.
