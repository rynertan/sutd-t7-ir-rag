## Description
EMBRYOGENIC CALLUS AND CFTT SUSPENSION OF INBRED CORN Field of the Invention The invention relates to enbryogenic callus of corn inbred B73 a major commercial inbred corn variety. The invention also relates to cell suspensions derived from embryogenic callus of corn inbred B73. The cell suspensions may be characterized as uniform mixtures of embryogenic and other cells. Unexpectedly, the cell suspensions according to the invention give rise to embryos of corn inbred B73 under certain culture conditions described hereinbelow. The invention furthermore relates to viable seed producing plants of corn inbred B73 regenerated from the embryogenic callus or embryogenic cell suspensions according to the invention.Lastly, the invention concerns mutant and or recombinant progeny of embryogenic callus or embryogenic cell suspension and corn plants regenerated therefrom. Specific examples of the embryogenic callus of corn inbred B73, fran which embryogenic cell suspensions may be derived, have been deposited in the American Type Culture Collection under ATCC accession number 40116 on April 14, 1984 Relevant Art Zea mays L. or corn is a major worldwide cereal crop. In the continental United States alone, an estimated 82 million acres of corn is planted yearly. A survey of the U.S. corn germ plasn base conducted in 1979 accounting for 1.3 billion pounds of seed corn, determined that corn inbred B73 was used in the production of approximately 178.5 million pounds of corn hybrid seed. This amount reflects approximately 14 of the total corn seed required for the 1980 planting of 82 million acres of corn in the United States. B73 was used to produce more hybrid vXLZi seed .hen. any other corn inbred line in the 1979 survey. As the major inbred corn line used in hybrid corn seed production, B73 is a oommercially important corn inbred. Successful efforts to improve B73 are likely to have a major impact on the commercial corn seed business. Current methods for improving inbred corn lines are time consuming, labor intensive, and risky. Thus, methods that reduce any of these problems would represent an advance in the cereal breeding arts.One method for inducing changes in an inbred corn seed line is accomplished by exposing inbred seed corn to a mutagen, which may be ionizing radiation or a mutagenic chemical, growing the seed out, and screening the corn plants for a desired characteristic such as decreased height or pathogen resistance. Seed from plants displaying the desired characteristics are then replanted, rescreened and the seed fran plants passing the screen are retained. After several years and many grow outs of the seed, a sufficient seed stock of the inbred displaying the desired characteristic is accumulated for commercial breeding. Several problems attend the method of obtaining a modified inbred corn seed line as described above. Inbred corn lines are highly homozygous, or pure bred. Such inbred lines frequently display low vigor, and as a result frequently produce few seed. If seed production is too low, successful large scale production of seed derived from a single plant of a modified inbred line may not be possible at all. Even if the modified inbred is vigorous and produces adequate numbers of fertile seed, several years and many acres of land are required to produce enough seeds to make commercial breeding possible. Other approaches to the propagation of desirable modified inbreds have also been suggested and rely upon plant tissue culture techniques.In sane of these approaches, cell cultures are subjected to mutagenic ionizing radiation. The desirable characteristic is selected or screened in cell culture. Cells having the desirable characteristic are propagated in culture and ultimately regenerated to form seed bearing plants see e.g., Bottino P. J., The Potential of Genetic Manipulation of Plant CellCultures for Plant Breeding, Radiation Botany, 15 1 16 1975 . The feasibility of using selection techniques on callus cultures of certain non commercial corn inbreds and the regeneration of plants producing seed that carry the characterstic selected in tissue culture has been demonstrated by Hibbert et al. see, Selection and Characterization of a Feedback Insensitive Tissue Culture of Maize, Planta, 148 183 187 1980 . Prior to the developnent of the embryogenic callus line of corn inbred B73 of the instant invention, no friable embryoqenic callus culture or embryogenic cell suspension culture of a commercially significant inbred corn line has been described. With respect to embryogenic callus lines of noncommercial corn inbreds, C.E.Green has described a friable callus of corn inbred A188 capable of regenerating plants by scmatic embryogenesis see, Green, C.E., Somatic Embryogenesis and Plant Regeneration Fran the Firable Calus of Zea inlays L. in Proc. 5th Int l. Cong.Plant Tissues and Cells, F3cio Fujiwara ed., Japanese Association of PlantTissue Culture, pub. Tokyo, Japan, 1982 . Embyrogenic, friable A188 callus according to Green can be derived from spontaneous sectors of organogenic callus. Organogenic callus according to Green can be obtained as follows. Immature zygotic embryos from the seed of sibling pollinatedA188 are removed from the seed and placed in a Murashige and Skoog MS, see Murashige and Skoog, Physiolosia Plantarium, 15 426 1962 medium, with 0.5 mg l 2,4 D, 1 mM t asparagine, and 0.7 bactoagar.The immature zygotic embryos are incubated at 28 C with 16 hours light per day. SeeSpringer, W.D. et al., 1979, A Histological Examination of Tissue CultureInitiation From Immature Embryos of Maize , Protoplasma, 101, 269 281. The scutellum of the primary zygotic embryo proliferates rapidly and forms an organogenic callus culture. The epithelium of the scutellum becomes highly meristematic. Apical meristems form at the surface of the culture which is characterized by an extended cambial zone. Because no root primordia are associated with the shoot primordia, the callus is considered organogenic. Green s embryogenic callus arises spontaneously as sectors growing from the established organogenic callus or can be induced fran primary cultures with proline. Proline, however, does not appear to induce embryogenic callus in B73. Green s embryogenic callus appears undifferentiated, highly friable, has little organization on visual inspection and is fast growing, requiring sub culturing at least every two weeks. The embryogenic callus culture described by Green develops to the coleoptilar stage on MS or N6 medium with 2 sucrose and 0.5 to 1.0 mg l 2,4 D.Normal development to the mature embryo stage is possible if the embryos are transferred to N6 medium with 6 sucrose and no 2,4 D. The mature embryos can then be induced to germinate on MS or N6 medium containing 2 sucrose without hormones. Green also describes suspension cultures of the embryogenic line of A188 and discloses that such suspension cultures can be maintained inMS medium containing 1 mg i 2,40 with 2 sucrose. When aliquots of the suspension cultures are plated onto solidified MS medium containing 2 sucrose, a callus forms from the plated suspension and embryos form on the callus surface. These embryos are transferred to MS or N6 medium with 6 sucrose for further development. After 2 weeks on medium with 6 sucrose these are transferred to low sucrose, hormone free medium for embryo generation. A188 plants may be routinely regenerated from these embryos. A non regenerating cell line of corn inbred B73 is known seePotrykus et al, Theoretical Applied Genetics, 54 209, 1979 . This cell line in suspension culture was established from a primary culture of protoplasts from plant tissues of the B73 inbred. The cells are characterized as growing well in suspension culture and easily maintainable on agar medium. Furthermore, the.cells can be enzymatically turned into protoplasts, which in tum regenerate walls and become proliferating cells again. Significantly, the cells of this line have never been induced to regenerate plants and moreover display ploidy abnormalities, a characteristic well known in other non regenerating diploid plant cell lines. SeeM. G.Meadows, Characterization of Cells and Protoplasts of the 373 MaizeCell Line Plant Science Letters, 28 337 348 1982 83 . Other attempts to achieve plant regeneration from established B73 callus have been similarly unsuccessful. See Bartkowiak, E., Tissue Culture of Maize PlantletRegeneration From Scutella Callus, Genetica Polonica, Vol. 23 93 101 1982 . The ability to culture somatic cells of inbred plants in vitro enables the plant breeder to apply the techniques of microbial genetics to specific breeding problems in crop plants. Included in the genetical approaches that have application to plant breeding are selection of mutations in cell cultures, studying host pathogen interrelationships, transfer of genetic information into cells through uptake of exogenous heterologus see Szoka et al., U. S. Patent 4,394,448 or homologous see IPRI European Patent Application No. 90033A DNA. Furthermore, somatic cell culture enables the plant breeder to develop, select and propagate somaclonal variants having novel or useful agronomic characteristics. The major obstacle to the application of these techniques to commercial corn inbred B73 and some other camnercial inbreds has, until now, been the inability to provide a tissue culture or cell suspension that can regenerate whole plants. The embryogenic corn callus line and corn cell line derived therefrom provided by the instant invention makes it possible to apply somatic cell genetic techniques to a major commercial corn line for the first time. The particular uses to which a cereal, and particularly a corn cell line such as the one described herein, can be put are outlined in numerous articles see e.g., Bottino, P.J. Potential ofGenetic Manipulation in Plant Cell Culture, Radiation Botany, Vol 15 1 16 1975 and Vasil, I.E., Plant Cell Culture and Somatic Cell Genetics of Cereals and Grasses, Plant Imovement and Somatic Cell Genetics,Vasil, Ed., Academic Press, N.Y., 1st Ed., 1983 and Tissue Culture in the Production of Novel Disease Resistant Crop Plants, Biol. Rev., 54 329 345 1979 . These uses include selection at the cellular level of mutations for resistance to toxic substances, such as herbicides and substances produced by plant pathogens. Since the selections are carried out at the cellular level, it is likely that whole plants regenerated from the cells will show the selected characteristic. It is significant that such a system would allow plant breeders to select or screen for the desired characteristic from among thousands of cells in a single culture dish or flask, whereas a large field plot would be required to select or screen a corresponding number of seed grown plants according to traditional plant breeding methods. It has, for example, been demonstrated that corn plants derived from Black Mexican Sweet corn, a non ccmmercial cultivar, can be regen erated from tissue cultures that have been selected for resistance to lysine and threonine and that tissues of the regenerated plant likewise produce corn plant tissue that is resistant to lysine and threonine. See Hibbert, K.A et al., Selection and Characterization of a Feedback Insensitive Tissue Culture of Maize, Planta, 148 183 187 1980 . The utility of such selections carried out in callus cultures has also been demonstrated by the regeneration from callus culture of corn plants resistant to southern corn leaf blight, a plant disease caused by a pathotoxin produced by the plant pathogen Heleenthosporium maydis race T.By exposing corn callus to the pathotoxin produced by the plant pathogen, resistant callus was selected. Significantly, the progeny of certain resistant plants were also resistant to the toxin and plant pathogen.Thus callus culture of a corn cell line is demonstrably effective in the development of pathogen resistant corn seed.

Sumnary of the Invention The present invention canprises tissue cultures pf corn inbred line B73. These tissue cultures are characterized as embryogenic callus cultures of corn inbred B73 and cell suspension cultures derived from the embryogenic callus culture of corn inbred B73 As used herein, the term embryogenic callus is defined as a friable callus having no visible organization on maintenance medium but on regeneration medium organizes into discrete globular structures, a portion of which germinate to form plants. As used herein the term variation is defined as phenotypic changes that are stable, i.e., they persist in the absence of the event that induced the change and heritable, i.e., the new phenotype is transmitted to daughter cells then they divide. Changes in phenotype that persist only so long as the cells or tissues are maintained in a new environment are referred to as physiological responses. Genetic variation is used herein to describe heritable variation that is sexually transmitted to progeny of plants regenerated from cultured cells or tissues. The term mutant is reserved for the special case of genetic variation in which a trait is transmitted meiotically according to well established laws of inheritance. When the nature of the heritable change is not known, the term nvariant is used. As used herein the term regenerated , referring to plants, means plants derived from cell and tissue culture. The term progeny means plants obtained by self fertilization, sibling fertilization, backcrossing or out crossing of the regenerated plants. As used herein the term clone refers to callus or cell suspensions propagated from an established cell suspension or callus line. The embryogenic callus culture of corn inbred B73 characteristically is a collection of substantially isodiametric cells which grow in clumps or aggregates of cells on solid maintenance medium such as Ms medium or N6 medi that has been supplemented with 0.25 to 1.0 mg l 2,4 D and 2 wt vol sucrose. On maintenance medium the embryogenic callus is friable, i.e., easily broken into smaller clumps of cells and single cells. Under the light microscope, no continuous epidermal layer is visible in the embryogenic callus. In general, the embryogenic callus is yellow brown in color.Growth of the embryogenic callus is rapid, as measured in fresh weight accumulation the embryogenic callus grows about 3 times faster than the organogenic callus culture from which it arose. As a consequence of its growth rate, the embryogenic callus needs to be transferred to new medium every 1 2 weeks. The embryogenic callus is further characterized by the absence of differentiated plant structure such as small shoots or their primordia, rcots or their primordia, and meristems. A characteristic of cell suspensions derived from the callus is the production of a mucilagenous polysaccharide in media containing sucrose and 2,4 D. This polysaccharide has been identified as a glactose mannose polymer. The most notable characteristic of the embryogenic callus is its formation of embryo like structures. The embryo like structures are com pact and globular. By transferring the globular structures to a hormonefree medium such as MS or N6 medium, some of these globular structures can be induced to form plants. The plants can be transferred to soil and fertile B73 corn plants are obtained. The progeny of these regenerated plants are substantially identical in form to seed grown B73 plants.Thus, the invention encompasses corn plants regenerated from an embryogenic callus of corn inbred B73 and the progeny of the regenerated corn plants. The invention further comprises embryogenic cell suspension cultures of embryogenic callus culture of corn inbred B73. Unexpectedly, these cell cultures retain the ability to regenerate viable B73 corn plants. B73 cell suspensions capable of regenerating whole plants are initiated from friable B73 callus maintained on MS medium. The friable callus is transferred into a medium suitable for maintaining suspension culture, e.g. MS medium with 2 mg l 2,4 D, and is placed on a gyrotary shaker at 130 rpm at 28at. Cell suspensions are induced to form globular embryos by plating on solidified Ms or N6 medium containing no hormones and 2 6 sucrose.Globular embryos are transferred to solidified MS or N6 medium containing no hormones, 2 sucrose and optionally charcoal added to adsorb residual hormones, if any, and plantlets form on this medium. Thus the invention encompasses corn plants regenerated from an embyrogenic cell suspension of corn inbred B73 and the progeny of the regenerated corn plants. r, The invention will be better understood from the following exams ples which are intended by the inventor to be exemplary only and nonlimiting. EXAMPLE 1 Initiation of Organogenic Culture Plants from maize inbred line B73 were grown to maturity in a greenhouse supplemented with metal halide lights 15 hours day and maintained at 30 C during the day and 21 C at night. These plants were selfor sibling pollinated. Immature zygotic embryos 1.0 2.0 millimeters mm in length 12 14 days post pollination were aseptically removed from surface sterilized kernels and placed flat side down on the initiation medium which contained Ms salts and MS vitamins, 150 mg l asparagine, 0.6 agar, 0.5 mg l 2,4 D and 12 sucrose. All culture medium had been adjusted to a pH of 5.8 prior to autoclaving.Cultures were incubated in the dark at 28 C for 2 3 weeks, when a compact white tissue proliferated from the coleorhizal end of the scutellum. The zygotic embryonic shoot axis was not part of the proliferating tissues. The white compact tissue which was composed of small parenchyma like cells with meristematic regions was covered by an epidermal layer. Numerous root meristems, occasional shoots and starch grains were seen in this tissue. White compact tissue was removed from the embryos, transferred to a maintenance medium, which was the same as the initiation medium but included 0.5 1.0 mg l 2,4 D and 2 sucrose, and cultured under Agrolites 1500 lux at 280C. Cultures were transferred to fresh medium every 10 20 days. The compact tissue produced on the initiation medium became extremely heterogeneous when transferred to the maintenance medium. Numerous shoots, roots, as well as friable and compact green tissues became visible. Leafy and rooty tissues were carefully removed and discarded from the compact organogenic tissue at each transfer. After one year of continuous selection against non regenerating regions and roots, the resulting organogenic tissue was dark green, comr pact, convoluted and covered by a well defined epidermis. This epidermal layer remained continuous even in zones that produced shoot meristems.Meristematic centers were common beneath the epidermal layer. This tissue was characterized by an extremely slow growth rate which could be increased by the addition of 9 mg l zeatin. The addition of zeatin also reduced the quantity of tissues normally selected against. EXAMPLE 2 Initiation and Selection of Embryogenic Callus A friable, fast growing callus was selected from the organogenic tissue after over one year in culture in the following manner. The organogenic callus from which the embryogenic callus was isolated was transferred to maintenance medium contining MS salts and MS vitamins, 150 mg l asparagine, 1 mg l 2, 4D, 1 mg l 3,5 dichlorophenxy acetic acid 3,5 D , 2 sucrose and 0.68 washed agar. The organogenic callus was transferred after 3 weeks to fresh medium having the same oomponents. After a total of 5 weeks on the medium, the embryogenic callus appeared as small isodiametric cells having dense cytoplasm and large nuclei on microscopic examination. The sectors were embedded in a mucilagenous matrix. The sectors and mucilagenous matrix were removed from the surrounding compact organogenic callus with sterile tweezers or were removed by scraping with a sterile scapel. The sectors and mucilagenous matrix were placed on maintenance medium as described above but lacking 3,5 D. Friable embryogenic callus grew approximately 3 times faster than the organogenic tissue on the maintenance medium with 3,5 D.Although the embryogenic callus was initially isolated from an organogenic callus that had been grown on maintanence medium including 3,5 D, embryogenic sectors have been subsequently isolated from organogenic callus that has been maintained without 3, SD. These isolates, however, tend to rapidly organize and cannot be maintained. EXAMPLE 3 Initiation of Suspension Cultures One and seventy seven one hundredths gram 1.77 g of friable callus tissue from corn inbred B73 was inoculated into 25 ml of MS medium having the following components magnesium sulfate seven hydrate MgS04t7H20 , calcium chloride dihydrate CaCl2 2H20 potassium nitrate KNO3 , ammonium nitrate NH4NO3 , potassium phosphate KH2P04 , manganese sulfatefour hydrate MnSO4.4H2O , zinc sulfate.seven hydrate ZnSO4.7H2O , cupric sulfate.five hydrate CuS04 5 H2O , cobalt chloride six hydrate CoC12 6H20 potassium iodide KI , boric acid H3sO3 , sodium molybdinum oxide.dihydrate Na2MoO4.2H2O , ferrous sulfate.seven hydrate FeSO4.7H2O , and sodium ethylenediaminotetracetic acid Na2EDTA .In general, as used in the invention, the exact concentration of the salts can be varied within limits without departing from the invention. To standardize the making of the media, however, the concentrations of the above listed minimal salts are as follows MgSO4.7H2O 370 milligrams liter mg l CaCl2.2H2O 440 mg I KNO3 1900 mg lNH4NO3 1650 mg lKH2P04 170 mg lMnSO4.4H2O 22.3 mg l ZnS04 7H20 8.6 mg l COS04 5H20 0.025 mg lCoCl2.6H2O 0.025 ms l KI 0.83 mg lH3BO3 6.2 mg lNa2MoO4.2H2O 0.25 mg lFeSO4.7H2O 28.75 mg l Na2EDrA 37.25 mg i The mediun further contains the following vitamins, hormones and carbohydrate sources Thiamine HCl 0.2 mg lPyroxin.HCl 0.25 mg lNicotinic acid 1.3 mg lCalcium pantothenate 0.25 mg lL asparagine 132.0 mg l 2,4 D 2.0 mg i sucrose 2 weight volume pH 6.0 The friable embryogenic callus and medium are placed in a 100 mlDelong flask and are incubated at 27 C on a gyratory shaker at 130 rpm with indirect lighting from Agrolites for 16 hours a day for 7 days. Cultures were transferred every 7 days in a 2 to 5 culture to medium transfer into 50 ml of the same media in 250 ml Delong flasks. Embryos are generated fran the suspension cultures by removing a one ml aliquot from a 7 day old transfer and placing it on a solid plant growth medium such as MS medium or N6 medium containing no hormones or 0.01 mg l 2,4 D and from 2 to 6 sucrose. The plates are maintained under the conditions described in Example 4 for approximately one week. Plants may be regenerated from the embryos by transferring the embryos to MS orN6 media containing no hormones and 2 to 6 sucrose as described inExample 6 below. EXAMPLE 4 Formation of Embyros and Plantlets A 15 day old suspension culture having a volume of approximately 25 ml was placed in a sterile centrifuge tube and the cells were spun down at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the cells were resuspended in 25 ml of hormone free N6 medium containing 6 sucrose.One ml of the resuspended cells was dispensed onto solid N6 medium containing 6 sucrose, no hormones, and 0.6 washed agar K.C. Biologicals,Renex, Kansas . The plates were covered and maintained at 27 C underAgrolites at 1000 to 3000 lux for 16 hours a day. After 23 days, numerous globular structures grew on the hormone free N6 medium containing 6 sucrose. These globular structures were removed and transferred to hormone free MS medium with 2 sucrose and 0.1 charcoal. After 6 days four plantlets approximately 1 to 2 centimeters cm in length having shoots and roots were obser ed. EXAMPLE 5 Regeneration of B73 Plantlets from Suspension Cultures A B73 suspension maintained as a suspension for approximately 4 months was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 minutes to pellet its cells.These cells were then weighed and dilutes with hormone free M.S. medium to a concentration of 100 mg suspended cells ml hormone free medium. One ml of medium 100 mg cells was plated onto no hormone N6 medium with 2 sucrose, 0.1t charcoal, pH 5.8. These plates were incubated at 280C in the dark. After one month, globular structures formed which were then transferred to fresh medium and placed under Agrolites. After approximately 3 weeks, many of these structures had developed into plantlets. EXAMPLE 6 Regeneration of B73 Plants from Embryogenic Callus Culture One hundred mg of friable B73 callus petri plate was placed onN6 medium with 4 sucrose and no hormones. These plates were incubated at 28 C in the dark. After 27 days numerous plantlets were removed and transferred to plastic tissue culture boxes about 3 indhes x 3 inches x 4 inches containing 50 ml of hormone free M.S. medium with 2 sucrose.After approximately one month, six of these plants were transferred to pots in the greenhouse. All of these plants were grown to maturity. EXAMPLE 7 Isozyme Comparison of EmbryDgenic B73 Callus Culture and Non Embryogenic B73 tissue Between 0.5 and 5 grams of the corn inbred B73 tissue indicated below were placed in an equal weight of homogenization buffer containing 16.7 w v sucrose, 8.3 w v asorbic acid at pH 7.4, and was homogenized using a Porter tissue homogenizer. The e homogenate was prepared for starch gel electrophoresis and the resulting gels were stained for esterase Figure 1 , alcohol dehydrogenase Figure 2 glutamate dehydrogenase Figure 3 and glucosidase Figure 4 as described by Goodnan et al. in Genetics, 96 697 70. In Figures 1 4 below, the tissues were grown as follows Leaves taken directly from 6 week old greenhouse maintained B73 plants.Coleoptile taken from shoots six days after germination from seed.Shoots taken from mature B73 seeds one day after soaking in distilled water.Scutellum taken from mature B73 embryo one day after soaking in dis tilled water. Zyaotic Embryo taken 19 days after pollination. Imnature Zygotic Embryo Rescued taken 12 days after pollination and then transferred to the medium of Example 3 for 7 days. Embrycgenic 2,4 D friable embrogenic callus tissues of B73 that were maintained on the medium of Example 3 without 2, 4D for 19 days. Embryogenic 2,4 D friable embryogenic tissues of B73 that were main tained on the medium of Example 3.Organogenic organogenic tissue of B73 that were maintained on the medium of Example 3. Figures 1 4 are representations of starch gels run for the indicated enzymes. The gels patterns show the following results Esterase Figure 1 Embryogenic cultures gave the same isozyme patterns as rescued zygotic embryos and organogenic cultures gave the same isozyme pattern as mature leaves. Alcohol dehydrogenase Figure 2 organogenic cultures and embryogenic cultures on medium without 2,4 D gave the same isozyme pattern as zygotic embryos, but embryogenic cultures on the same medium containing 2,4 D did not. Glutamate dehydrogenase Figure 3 embryogenic cultures on medium without 2,4D gave the same pattern as zygotic embryos, but embryo genic cultures on maintenance medium with 2, 4 D did not. ss Glucosidase Figure 4 embryogenic and organogenic culture gave the same pattern as coleoptiles but a different pattern than zygotic embryos. These results support the characterization that regeneration from embryogenic cultures proceeds by a type of somatic embryogenesis.The presence of isozymes usually associated with coleoptiles suggests that the timing of embryogenic developnental events may be different than that of of zygotic embryos. EXAMPLE 8 Characterization of Polysaccharide Secretion Product of Embryogenic B73 Tissues Ten ml of a 7 day old embryogenic cell suspension of corn inbredB73 was transferred into a fresh 50 ml aliquot of the medium of Example 3.The cultures were grown in the light at 27 C in a shaker at 130 rpm. After 7 days, cells and debris were removed from the medium by centrifuge tion or filtration. The remaining clear culture medium was then diluted with 3 volumes of ethanol 95 v v at room temperature with stirring. A white fibrous precipitate formed, was collected on a glass rcd, washed in absolute ethanol and dried in a vacuum dessicator oven. The dried precipit ate was hydrolyzed in 1 normal hydrochloric acid for 6 hours at 100 C and the component sugars were analyzed by 13C natural abundance nuclear magnetic resonance 13C NMR on a Varian XL 200 NMR spectrometer. The polysaccharide was identified as a polymer comprising galactose and mannose in about a 4 1 glactose mannose ratio. The polymer has a oooposition different from maize root slime, which contains a glucose rich polymer abundant in fucose and galacturonic acid, and corn hull gum, which contains xylose, arabinose and galatose in a 7 5 1 ratio see Smith, F. et al., The Chemistry of Plant Gums and Mucilages and Some RelatedPolysaccharides, Reinhold Publishing Corp., New York . ExAMPLE 9 Carbon Source Utilization Embryogenic suspension cultures of worn inbred B73 were washed in carbohydrate free medium and plated onto the medium of Example 3 that had been solidified with 0.6 washed agar and contained 1 w v of the filtersterilized test compounds listed in Table I below. Colony growth was assessed visually after 2 weeks and 9 weeks growth in the dark at 27 C. The toxicity of galactose in the presence of sucrose was tested on embryogenic suspension cultures of corn inbred B73 by incorporating galactose 0.1 to 6 w v into the medium of Example 3 containing 2 w v sucrose. Growth was measured by packed cell volume PCV after 7 days incubation on a shaker at 27 C in the light.

Most of the carbon sources did not support growth of the cells and the best growth was obtained with sucrose and glucose. Soluble starch supported good growth of the cell line after an initial lag period. The cell line showed limited growth on sorbitol but no growth on proline and lactose. The embryogenic corn cell line of B73 showed limited growth response to galactose. The embryogenic callus of corn inbred B73 which grew on starchcontaining plates appeared to lack the galactomannan secretion present in the plates containing sucrose or glucose. Suspension cultures of the same tissue growing on starch produced no detectable amounts of galactomannan. ExAMPLE 10 Plants obtained in Example 6 were grown in the greenhouse and were either self pollinated, backcrossed to the parent B73 line, or sibling pollinated with sister regenerated plants designated R1S1 for self pollinated, R1BC1 for backcrossed and R1Sib1 for sibling. pollinated .The corn progenies were produced from four regenerated plants. Two of the regenerated plants were self pollinated using the main stem ear and a tiller tassel. Because of asynchronous emergence of tassels and silks and frequent occurence of tassel ears, the remaining regenerated corn plants could often not be self pollinated, but instead were used as female parents in crosses to seed grown B73. The seeds produced were grown out in the field between December, 1983 and March 1984. Plants were evaluated in early February, which was approximately two weeks post pollination for the corn. A total of ten rows of regenerant progeny were planted out ear to row. In addition, two seed grown plants used as male parents in crosses with the regenerants were also self pollinated and used as check rows. Traits examined included plant height, ear height, stem diameter, leaf number and any evidence of single gene mutations affecting plant Qnpearance. While some rows showed evidence of salt stress, no differences could be seen between the R1S1, R1BC1, and R1Sibl progeny and the seed grcwn check rows. Frcm the foregoing it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that embryogenic tissues and cell suspensions of corn inbred B73 will enable plant breeders, practitioners of methods of plant tissue and cell culture, and plant molecular biologists to carry out major improvements in this valuable and widely used corn inbred. The embryogenic cultures of corn inbred B73 provided by the instant invention make it possible, for example, to subject these cultures to in vitro mutagenesis to induce variation in corn plants regenerated therefrom.Methods for chemical and physical mutagenesis as well as cell culture techniques for the recovery of desirable mutants are well known to those skilled in the art see for example Popova, J., Possibilities of Inducing Economically Useful Mhta tions in Maize Seed by Treatment with Ethyl Methanesulphonate, GeneticPlant Breeding, 8 282 290 1975 Balint et al., Examination of WF9Mutants Suolines for Lodging and Fusarim Resistance, Induced MutationsAgainst Plant Diseases, pp. 489 494 IAEA, Vienna Weber and Lark, AnEfficient Plating System for Rapid Isolation of Mutants from Plant CellSuspensions, Theor. Appl.Genetics, 55 81 86 1979 and Thomas, J.A. et al., Improvement of Crop Plants via Single Cells in Vitro An Assessment, Z. Planzenzucht, 82 1 3 1979 . Thus, the invention is considered to encanpass mutagenized B73 tissue cultures and cell suspensions and corn plants regenerated therefrom and the mutant or variant progeny of the regenerated corn plants. The ability to regenerate whole plants from the embryogenic tissue and cell suspension cultures of corn inbred B73 provided by the instant invention also enables those skilled in the art to carry out in vitro selections for desirable traits or against undesirable traits. SeeHibbert et al. and Bengenbach et al., both mentioned hereinabove. Thus, using the embryogenic tissue or cell suspensions cultures of corn inbredB73 of the instant invention, it is now possible to expose cultures of corn inbred B73 to selective agents for example herbicides and pathotoxins, to select tissues and cells resistant to the selective agents and to regenerate plants resistant to such selective agents.Thus, considered within the scope of the instant invention are embryogenic tissues and cells of corn inbred B73 selected in vitro, the corn plants and seed thereof regenerated therefrom and the progeny of the regenerated corn plants. It will also be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that embrycgenic tissue and cell suspension culture of corn inbred B73 provides the opportunity for the generation of sonaclonal variants in corn inbred B73 by regenerating plants from embryogenic tissue culture and cell suspension cultures of corn inbred B73 provided by the instant invention.Such stable sanaclonal variants are well known to those skilled in the art as exemplified in Edallo et al., Chromosomal Variation and Frequency ofSpontaneous Mutation Associated with the in vitro Culture and Plant Regeneration in Maize, Maydica 26, pp. 39 56 1981 Beckert et al., Etude de la Variabilite Genetique Obtenue Chez le Mais Apres Callogenese et Regeneration de Plants in vitro, Agronomie 3, pp. 9 18 1983 andLarkin et al., Somaclonal Variation A Novel Source of Variability fromCell Cultures for Plant Improvement, Theor. Appl. Genet. 60, pp. 197214 1981 . A large body of literature in fact suggests that plants regerr erated from culture are characterized by an unexpectedly high rate of stable propagatable phenotypic variation. See Rice, Tissue CultureInbred Genetic Variation in Regenerated Maize Inbred, 37th Ann. Corn BR Sorghum Research Conference 1983 . Thus it is now possible to provide progeny with genetic variations arising from somaclonal variants regenerated from corn inbred B73. Such characteristics may be stably maintained in the second generation progeny of the regenerated plants and will generally exhibit either Mendelian segregation e.g., 3 1 ratio for single gene traits or uniform expression since somaclonal variation arises in diploid cells and may generate hanozygous variants. Thus, the invention is considered to encompass scmaclonal variants of the embryogenic callus and cell suspension of corn inbred B73, corn plants and the seed thereof regenerated therefrom and the progeny of the regenerated corn plants.
