# FLUSHING CISTERNS

## Abstract
A flushing cistern to produce an energetic flush with a reduce volume of water, some 5 or 6 l for low level use. The cistern has a housing supporting a rotatable water holder having a large flow aperture in a curved surface and other wise closly conforming to the inside of the housing. The flush outlet is a large tapering outlet of hydraulically efficient form to which the aperture matches when the holder is rotated to produce a flush. The filling of the water holder can be arrang ed to occur only when the holder is in the correct position. Fault conditions are indicated by a warning flow of water from an overflow or elsewhere.
