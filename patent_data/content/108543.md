# Assembly of connecting rod and crankshaft.

## Abstract
A one piece connecting rod 11 for coupling a piston and crankshaft 23 to convert between reciprocating and rotary motion as might be used in an internal combustion engine is formed of a lightweight material such as alumi nium, which material is of an inadequate hardness to form a roller bearing race. The rod includes an elongate arm portion having enlarged annular portions at opposite ends thereof and with one of those annular portions having an opening 13 for receiving, in a press fit manner, a hardened steel liner 17 to provide an outer bearing race. Rollers 27 are then interposed between this outer race and an eccentric portion 25 of a crankshaft 23 while the other enlarged annular portion receives a bearing 19 for connection to a piston wrist pin.
