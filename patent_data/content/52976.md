# Roll operator for glass sheet conveyor of bending system.

## Abstract
A glass sheet bending system 10 disclosed includes a horizontal roller conveyor 16 having a roll operator for operating a plurality of conveyor rolls 18 adjacent an associated bending apparatus 22 to control conveyance thereon independent of conveyance on the other rolls of the conveyor. In one embodiment, the roll operator comprises a roll shifter 24 for shifting the rolls 18 along the direction of conveyance during continued rotational driving. In another embodiment, the roll operator comprises a positioning drive 140 that drives the conveyor rolls 18 adjacent the bending apparatus 22 independently of the other rolls of the conveyor. Both embodiments, reduce the rate of glass sheet conveyance as the holder 60 receives each glass sheet 6 to reduce sliding at a surface 62 of the holder 60 . Also, repositioning of leading and trailing glass sheets 6 can be initially per formed along the direction of conveyance to provide accu rate location of the sheets 6 on the holder 60 with respect to each other in preparation for bending on associated molds 68 .
