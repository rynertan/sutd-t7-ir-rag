# A cylinder lock.

## Abstract
A cylinder lock 1 has a normal locking mode 12 o clock position and a service locking mode 10 o clock position . When the cylinder plug 3 is left in the service mode of the lock, with the aid of standard key, the lock can be turned with the aid of a service key 9 . The service key is latched against withdrawal in the normal mode of the lock, by means of an intermediate pin 7 of larger diameter than a corresponding upper pin 4 in the normal mode of the lock. The intermedi ate pin can be received in a widened part 3b of a corresponding pin channel 3a in the cylinder plug, but is unable to enter the pin channel 2a of the cylinder housing of smaller diameter, hence latching the service key 9 . Subsequent to using the service key 9 , the cylinder is returned to the normal locking mode 12 o clock position with the aid of the standard key, whereafter the lock can only be opened with the aid of the standard key. Each of the two modes can be defined by a spring biased ball disposed in a suitable pin channel and arranged to snap in a correspond ing empty pin channel in the plug.
