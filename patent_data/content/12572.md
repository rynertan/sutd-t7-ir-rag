## Description
IMPROVED METHOD OF PREPARING CRYSTALLINE ZEOLITE ZSM 20 This invention relates generally to an improved method of preparing a crystalline zeolite material and particularly to an improved method of making substantially pure zeolite ZSM 20. Zeolitic materials, both natural and synthetic, have been demonstrated in the past to have catalytic properties for various types of hydrocarbon conversions. Certain zeolitic materials are ordered, porous crystalline aluminosilicate having a definite crystalline structure within which there are a large number of channels. These cavities and channels are precisely uniform in size. Since the dimensions of these pores are such as to accept for adsorption molecules of certain dimensions while rejecting those of larger dimensions, these materials have come to be known as molecular sieves and are utilized in a variety of ways to take advantage of these properties. Such molecular sieves, both natural and synthetic, include a wide variety of positive ion containing crystalline aluminosilicates. These aluminosilicates can be described as a rigid three dimensional framework of SiO4 and A104 in which the tetrahedra are cross linked by the sharing of oxygen atoms whereby the ratio of the total aluminum and silicon atoms to oxygen is 1 2. The electrovalence of the tetrahedra containing aluminum is balanced by the inclusion in the crystal of a cation, for example, an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal cation. This can be expressed wherein the ratio of aluminum to the number of various cations, such as Ca 2, Sr 2, Na, K orLi is equal to unity. One type of cation may be exchanged either entirely or partially by another type of cation utilizing ion exchange techniques in a conventional manner.By means of such cation exchange, it has been possible to vary the properties of a given aluminosilicate by suitable selection of the cation.The spaces between the tetrahedra are occupied by molecules of water prior to dehydration. Prior art techniques have resulted in the formation of a great variety of synthetic aluminosilicates. These aluminosilicates have come to be designated by letter or other convenient symbols, as illustrated by zeolite A U.S. Patent 2,882,243 , zeolite X U.S. Patent 2,882,244 , zeolite Y U.S.Patent 3,130,007 , zeolite ZK 5 U.S. Patent 3,247,195 , zeolite ZK 4 U.S. Patent 3,314,752 zeolite ZSM 5 U.S.Patent 3,702,886 , zeolite ZSM 11 U.S. Patent 3,709,979 , zeolite ZSM 12 U.S. Patent 3,832,449 and zeolite ZSM 20 U.S. Patent 3,972,983 , merely to name a few. A crystalline aluminosilicate zeolite well known in the art is faujasite. The ZSM 20 zeolite made by the present invention resembles faujasite in certain aspects of structure, but has a notably higher silica alumina ratio than faujasite. The present invention relates to an improved method of preparing synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate, designated as zeolite ZSM 20 or simply ZSM 20 . The ZSM 20 composition has a characteristic X ray diffraction pattern, the values of which are set forth in Table 1, of U.S. Patent 3,972,983. In the as synthesized form, the zeolite has a formula, in terms of mole ratios of oxides and in the anhydrous state, as follows 0.3 0.6 R20 C.4 0.7 M20 Al203 7 10 SiO2 wherein R is a tetraethylammonium cation and M is an alkali metal cation, especially sodium. Also, the zeolite ZSM 20 crystal structure is comprised of relatively uniform rigid three dimensional pore networks characterized by uniform pores of between 7 and 8 Angstrom units in diameter. Mile synthetic ZSM 20 zeolites or the thermally treated products thereof may be used in a wide variety of hydrocarbon conversion reactions, they are notably useful in the processes of polymerization, aromatization, cracking and hydrocracking. Other hydrocarbon conversion processes for which ZSM 20 or the thermally treated product thereof may be utilized in one or more of its active forms include, for example, alkylation and converting light aliphatics to aromatics such as in U.S. Patent 3,760,024. Zeolite ZSM 20 in accord with the invention is prepared from a solution containing sources of an alkali metal oxide, preferably sodium oxide, an oxide of tetraethylammonium, an oxide of aluminum, an oxide of silicon, wherein tetraalkylorthosilicates, e.g. ethyl, propyl etc., are the source of silica and water under controlled concentration of the hydroxyl, alkali metal, and tetraethylammonium ions, and having a composition, in terms of mole ratios of oxides., falling within the following ranges BROAD PREFERRED M R M 2 14 6 10 H20 Si02 7 20 8 10 H2O 0H 5 40 7 11 Si02 A1203 10 31 29 31 wherein R is a tetraethylammonium cation and M is an alkali metal cation, and maintaining the mixture until crystals of the zeolite are formed. Thereafter, the crystals are separated from the liquid and recovered.Typical reaction conditions consist of heating the foregoing reaction mixture to a temperature of from about 900C for a period of time of from about 2 weeks to about 6 weeks. A more preferred temperature range is from about 1000C to about 1200C with the amount of time at a temperature in such range being from about 1 week to about 1 month. The digestion of the gel particles is carried out until crystals form. The solid product is separated from the reaction medium, as by cooling the whole to room temperature, filtering and water washing. The crystalline product is dried, e.g. at 2300F, for from about 8 to 24 hours. Of course, milder conditions may be employed. if desired, e.g. room temperature under vacuum. The composition for the synthesis of syntheticZSM 20 can be prepared utilizing materials which can supply the appropriate oxide. Such compositions include aluminates, alumina, silicates as specified above, and hydroxides. Crystal size and crystallization time of theZSM 20 composition will vary with the nature of the reaction mixture employed. ZSM 20, another TEA zeolite, crystallIzes in competition with zeolite Beta and dense phases such as zeolite P. Water, sodium, and hydroxide levels control that competition. Tetraethylorthosilicate Et4SiO4 is a superior silica source for the rapid and efficient synthesis of ZSM 20 compared with the use of other soluble forms of silica such as 9 brand sodium silicate, silica sol, or the previously employed tetramethylorthosilicate sXIe4SiO4 . U.S. Patents 3,972,983 and 4,021,331 describe the preparations of ZSM 20 with Me4SiO4 over a relatively narrow SiO2 Al203 range at 1000C, static, in 1Q 42 days. It has now been found that ZSM 20 can be more reproducibly crystallized in shorter times at optimum OH levels and similar SiO2 Al203 range and temperature, if Et4SiO4 is used as the silica source.Further, the ethanol by product is also less toxic than methanol from Me4SiO4. Higher tetraalkylorthosilicates i.e. propyl, butyl, etc would be expected to be as effective, if not superior, silica sources. Not only must the Ma content of the reaction mixture be minimized, as with zeolite Beta synthesis, but also inZSM 20 synthesis the water level must be minimized for the rapid and efficient crystallization of ZSM 20. It has also been found that a low temperature aging period is not required prior to crystallization, but time is an important variable, for, as the reaction mixture becomes more siliceous during crystallization, Beta phase begins to form. In order to more fully illustrate the nature of the invention and the manner of practicing same, the following examples are presented. These examples are not to be considered limiting, as would be realized by one of ordinary skill in the art. EXAMPLES 1 11 and 12 18 The following examples whose reaction mixtures and results are tabulated in Tables I Example 1 11 andTable II Examples 12 21 below demonstrate the critical importance of the variables stated above. The products were prepared in the general manner as described inExample 19.
