The preferred sources of carbon in the nutrient medium are carbohydrates such as glucose, fructose, glycerin, starch and the like. Other sources which may be included are lactose, arabinose, xyldse, dextrin, molasses and the like. The preferred sources of nitrogen are yeast extract, peptone, gluten meal, cottonseed meal, soybean meal, corn steep liquor, dried yeast, wheat germ, etc., as well as inorganic and organic nitrogen compounds such as ammonium salts e.g. ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulphate, ammonium phosphate, etc. , urez, amino acid and the like. The carbon and nitrogen sources, though advantageously employed in combination, need not be used in their pure form because less pure materials, which contain traces of growth factors and considerable quantities of mineral nutrients, are also suitable for use. When desired, there may be added to the medium mineral salts such as calcium carbonate, sodium or potassium phosphate, sodium or potassium. chloride, magnesium salts, copper slats and the like. If necessary, especially when the culture medium foams seriously a defoaming agent, such as liquid paraffin, fatty oil, plant oil, mineral oil or silicone may be added. As in the case of the preferred methods used for the production of other antibiotics in massive amounts, submerged aerobic cultural conditions are preferred for the production of the FR 900156 substance in massive amounts. For the production in small amounts, a shaking or surface culture in a flask or bottle is employed. Furthermore, when the growth is carried out in large tanks, it is preferable to use the vegetative form of the organism for inoculation in the production tanks in order to avoid growth lag in the process of production of theFR 900156 substance. Accordingly, it is desirable first to produce a vegetative inoculum of the organism by inoculating a relatively small quantity of culture medium with spores or mycelia of the organism and culture them and then to transfer the cultured vegetative inoculum aseptically to large tanks.The medium, in which the vegerative inoculum is.produced, is substantially the same as or different from the medium utilized for the production of the FR 900156 substance. Agitation and aeration of the culture mixture may be accomplished in a variety cf ways. Agitation may be provided by a propeller or similar mechanical agitation equipment, by revolving or shaking the fermentor, by various pumping equipment or by the passage of sterile air through the medium. Aeration may be effected by passing sterile air through the fermentation mixture. The fermentation is usually conducted at a temperature between about 20 C and 40 C, preferably 300 C, for a period of about 50 hours to 100 hours. The FR 900156 substance can be recovered from the culture medium by conventional means which are commonly used for the recovery of other known antibiotics. In general, most of the FR 900156 substance produced are found in the cultured broth, and accordingly the FR 900156 substance can be separated from the filtrate, which is obtained by filtering of centrifuging the culture broth, by a conventional method such as concentration under reduced pressure, lyophilization, pH adjustment, treatment with a resin e.g. anion or cation exchange resin, non ionic adsorption resin, etc. , treatment with an adsorbent e.g. activated charcoal, silicic acid, silica gel, cellulose, alumina, etc. , crystallization, recrystallization and the like. The FR 900156 substance thus produced in the culture broth can be isolated in the free form, i.e.,FR 900156 substance per se and when the solution or its concentrate containing the FR 900156 substance is treated with a base, i.e. with an inorganic base such as an alkali metal compound e.g. sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium hydroxide, etc. , an alkaline earth metal compound e.g. calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, etc.j, ammonia and the like, with an organic base e.g.ethanolamine, triethylamine, dicyclohexylamine, etc. or with an acid i.e. with an inorganic acid e.g.hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, etc. or with an organic acid e.g. formic acid, acetic acid, p toluenesulfonic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid etc. during operation of the processes, e.g. extraction, isolation or purification processes, the FR 900156 substance may be transformed into and isolated in the form of the corresponding salts thereof. Alternatively, thus prepared salts of theFR 900156 substance can easily be converted to the free form, i.e. FR 900156 substance per se in a conventional manner. Further, the FR 900156 substance obtained in the free form may be converted to the corresponding salts thereof with a base or an acid as mentioned above in a conventional manner. Accordingly, it is to be understood that this invention includes within the scope thereof theFR 900156 substance as well as salts thereof as mentioned above.

PROTECTIVE EFFICACY IN EXPERIMENTAL INFECTION IN MICE 1 In determining the protective efficacy against experimental infections in mice, the FR 900156 substance was dissolved and diluted in sterile water to provide three fold concentrations of drug for testing. Male DDY strain mice, aged 6 weeks and averaging 24 26 g in weight, were used in groups of four mice each. Overnight cultures of Escherichia coli No.22 inDifco Nutrient Broth was diluted to 1 100 in fresh medium and incubated at 30 C with shaking. When the cell density of 1 x 108 ml was obtained, 0.2 my of the culture was injected intraperitoneally. All the animals receiving the challenge and not treated with the drug died within 48 hours of the infection. One fifth ml of the FR 900156 substance solution was injected subcutaneously, 1,4,5, and 6 days before the infection. Two days after infection, the test was considered complete and survival records of that day were made.The test results are shown in Table 3.

E. coli 22 was cultivated overnight at 370C on Trypticase soy agar and then were suspended in a sterile saline to obtain microbial cell concentration of 1.6 x 108 CFU ml. Mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 0.2 ml of the suspension.Each of the test drugs was given intraperitoneally in various doses to a group of ten mice 24 hours before challenge.

Procedure Mice DDY male 5 6 W ere injected via the tail vein with a dose of 0.01 ml g body weight of carbon. Blood samples were taken by means of a pointed capillary pippet calibrated to hold a 50 ul and previously washed in heparin. This was plunged into the retroorbital venous sinus at the nasal angle of the eye. The samples were removed at 3 and 6 min. The blood was immediately discharged into 3.0 ml of the sodium carbonate solution. This hemolyzed the blood and allowed the quantita tion of carbon. The samples were then read in a spectrophotometer at 660 nm, the log concentration being obtained from a previously determined standard curve. The clearance value K may be determined by plotting log carbon concentration against time according to the following relationship EMI48.1 in which T1 and T2 represent the time in min when the sample were withdrawn and C1 and C2 represent the concentrations of carbon in the blood at the time T1 and T2, respectively.
