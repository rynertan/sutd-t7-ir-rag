# Iron catalyst for ammonia synthesis.

## Abstract
A pelleted iron oxide catalyst precursor wherein the iron oxide has an O Fe atomic ratio in the range 1.2 to 1.4, a high surface area and a density of at least 2.6 g.cm Â³. The precursor may be made by de oxidising, by heating in the presence of a steam hydrogen mixture, an iron oxide composition made by precipitation and calcination, followed by pelleting after de oxidation.
