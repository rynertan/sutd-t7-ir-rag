# Apparatus for cooling a shelter containing a heat source.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for passively cooling a shelter containing a heat source utilising an accumulator 18 containing a thermal liquid 20 a first heat transfer loop 22 for transferring heat from the interior 16 of the shelter to the liquid in the accumulator when the liquid is cooler than the interior of the shelter and a second heat transfer loop 24 for transferring heat from the liquid in the accumulator to the environment when the latter is cooler than the thermal liquid in the accumulator.
