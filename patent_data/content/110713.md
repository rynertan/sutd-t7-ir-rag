# Spraying equipment.

## Abstract
Spraying equipment, for example for applying herbicide, comprises a spraying head 6 mounted on one end of a support tube 2 , the other end of which is adapted to be held by an ope rator. The spraying head 2 comprises a body 48 which ac commodates an electric motor 50 and an atomising disc 54 which, in operation, is driven by the motor 50 . Liquid is sup plied to the disc 54 through a supply tube 38 and power is supplied to the motor 50 through a lead 36 . The tube 38 and the lead 36 are accommodated within the support tube 2 . Upon rotation of the disc 54 , fluid is ejected by centrifugal force from the periphery of the disc 54 after being subjected to a wiping action as it passes through a narrow gap 68 be tween the disc 54 and the body 48 . This wiping action spreads the fluid evenly around the disc 54 .
