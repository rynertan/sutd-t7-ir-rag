# Cover assembly for optical recording medium.

## Abstract
A cover assembly 10 for use with disk shaped optical recording medium 14 , having two substantially identical halves 20, 22 , each having an inner surface adapted to provide upon assembly with the medium an air gap adjacent an optical recordable coating on the medium. Each cover half is transparent and has substantially no birefringent charac teristics on the region overlying the air gap, thus allowing light to pass unimpeded therethrough. The cover assembly is adapted to be coupled to the central hub of the optical re cording medium and to have a raised annulus 46, 48 adjacent thereto to support the assembly and minimize contact with the transparent portion.
