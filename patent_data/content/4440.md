# Improvements in or relating to gear assemblies.

## Abstract
A variable ratio gear assembly and transmission system. A rotor 10 carried by a piston and cylinder device 13, 15 engages a drive face 9 on a rotatable input shaft 3 and also engages a drive face 27 on a rotatable disc 28 . Rotation of the shaft 3 imparts traction or fluid film drive to the rotor 10 which latter imparts traction or fluid film drive to the disc 28 . Variation in the ratio of the gear is effected by actuation of the piston and cylinder device 13, 15 to displace the rotor 10 over the drive faces 9 and 27 whilst maintaining engagement therewith. A further rotor 33 carried by a piston and cylinder device 36, 38 drivingly engages by traction or fluid film drive with opposed drive faces 32 and 43 respectively carried by the disc 28 and an output shaft 45 . Displacement of the rotor 33 by actuation of the device 36, 38 varies or further varies the gear ratio. The drive face 9 is urged into engagement with the rotor 10 by a pin and slot device 7 which is responsive to the rotation of shaft 3 . The piston and cylinder device 13, 15 and possibly 36, 38 is pivotally mounted at 26 to the housing 1 so that it can be pivoted and urged into closer engagement with the drive face 27 upon axial displacement of the drive face 9 towards the face 27 . Mounted in the drive face 9 is a freely rotatable rotor 50 having a non driving region 49 which when engaged by the rotor 10 does not transmit drive from the shaft 3 to the rotor 10 . Rods 25 and 42 permit manual adjustment of the piston and cylinder devices. The output shaft 45 may be displaceable axially to move its drive face 43 into or out of engagement with the rotor 33 .
