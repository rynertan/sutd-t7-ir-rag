## Description
An apparatus for forming a Axture of air and gaseous fuel, and for checking and regulating the air fuel ratio of the said fixtureAs is known, for the air fuel mixture in engines that em ploy gaseous fuels for example, gaseous fuels produced by vaporizing liquefied petroleun gases the use is envisaged of a suitable nixing device at which the duct supplying the air and the pipe supplying the gaseous fuel teriinate, and from which the channel that carries the mixture towards the cylinders extends. The carburettor is placed in series with the said channel in cases when the engine can be powered either by petrol or by liquefied petroleum gas. ith internal combustion engines that utilize the above mentioned gaseous fuels, optimal operation as regards the powder and torquf delivered and the specific consumption, is achieved b raintaining constant a predetermined value of the mixing ratio the ratio in weight between the gas eous fuel and the air present in the mixture as the speed of the driving shaft varies.Known nixing devices do not maintain the said mixing ratio constant because of the fact that the flow of air is dependent, in accordance with a certain coefficient, on the vacuum value created in a constriction known as a Venturi tube with which the said mixing devices are provided, while the flow of vaporized fuel is dependent on the said vacuum in accordance with a different coefficient.In consequence of the foregoing, the nixing ratio does not remain constant as the said vacuun which depends directly on the vacuum that is created in the region of the throttle valve of the carburettor or, in other words, on the number of revolutions of the driving shaft varies, nA thus an optimal mixing ratio can only be obtained en the driving shaft is revolving at a certain speed, with all the problens this entrails. The regulating means, provided in knov.n mixing devices, can only operate . .hen the vesicle is at a standstill and they allow solely an adjustment to be made to the opti mization of the said razing ratio at a speed preset to suit the performance, at the said speed, it is wished to get the engine in question to yield. mhe main object of the invention is to make available an apraratus for forning a mixture of air and gaseous fuel, the structure of which differs distinctly from the methods of construction adopted for the mixing devices knove, and also for supplying the said mixture at a mixing ratio cor responding to the theoretical value required by the engine in every one of its operating conditions.The aforementioned object is, according to the invention, achieved with an apparatus Yor forming a mixture of air and gaseous fuel, and for checking and regulating the air fuel ratio of the said mixture, of the type that is connected to a source of supply of the said gaseous fuel and to an internal combustion engine supplied with the said mixture via a channel in which is created a vacuum consequential to the operation of means for regulatIng the speed of the driving shaft of the said engine, the said apparatus comprising at least one pipe that links the aforementioned source to the said channel an electrovalve placed along the said pipe and able to adopt, betrreen the linit closing and opening configurations, a plurality of working configurations first electrical devices for measuring the flow rate of the gaseous fuel passing through the said pipe, positioned along the latter donvlstream with respect to the said electrovalve at least one air supply duct that terminates at the said channel second electrical devices for measuring the flow rate of the air passing through the duct and an electronic logic group, connected electrically to the said first and second electrical devices, suitable for mesas urin the flow rate of the air and of the gaseous fuel and of processing the said readings in a functional relationship with values programed for the air fuel mixing ratio, the said group being destined to energize the said solenoid by means of variable frequency unidirectional impulses in order to obtain uniformity between the true mixing ratio of the mixture passing through the said channel and the mixing ratio progrnmed with the said group.It can be seen fron the foregoing that vihen the said mix ing ratio is optimal whereby complete and perfect combustion of the gaseous fuel be possible , the performance of the engine is, irrespective of variations in the tolerance of the mechanical components of the apparatus and of variations, as time goes by, in the physical chemical characteristics of the fuel and air, correspondingly op timal. Lh said ratio can be established without taking consump tion minimization into consideration, compatibly with the particular performance it is wished the engine to yield. If a higher performance is required, use is made for meas uring the speed at which the driving shaft of the said internal combustion engine rotates, of third electrical devices connected electrically to the said electronic logic group, the latter energizing the said solenoid, by means of variable frequency unidirectional impulses, in order to obtain a pre established functional relationship between the mixing ratio and the number of revolutions of the driving shaft of the said internal combustion engine.The characteristics of the invention are made apparent in th2 description that follows, with reference to the accompanying table of draiings, in which figure 1 shows, in a possible block diagram, the ap paratus according to the invention figure 2 shows, in an enlarged scale, the detail 5 in Figure 1, with the electrovalve in certain working configurations. Urith reference to the above listed figures, at 1 has been shosm a tank for liquefied gas for example, liquefied petroleum gas connected, via a pipe 3, to a pressure reducing valve vaporizer 2 of a kno e type. Dhe outgoing vaporized fuel from the pressure reducing valve 2 is sent, via a pipe 4, into a channel 20 which, in the case illustrated, terminates at a carburettor 12 of a known type suitable for both liquefied petroleum gas and petrol operation of the non illustrated internal combustion engine to which the apparatus forming the sub ect of the invention is connected .Following on after the pressure reducing valve 2, in series with the pipe A, there is first of all an electrovalve 5 and ten t 7o electrical sensors 6a and 6b whose output terminals 7 are destined to supply electrical sig nals proportional to the rate and to the temperature, respectively, of the flow V of gaseous fuel passing through the said pipe 4.The presence is justified of the sensor 6b since the sensor 6a is utilized in this particular form of embodiment to measure the flow rate in an indirect vjay, that is to say, on the basis of the quantity of heat that the flow V renoves fron an electrical sensor of a above type, the temperature of which is maintained constant.Because the temperature of the flow V is not constant, it is necessary for the sensor 6b to take this into account so that it can correct the reading taken by the sensor 6a. Between the limit close ing configuration C and the linit opening configuration A, the valve 5 adopts a plurality of working configurat ions L figure 2 such s to vary the value of the flow of gaseous fuel passing there trough and along the pipe 4.At r has been shown a duct, one extremity of which is provided with an air purifier 8 of a knoni type, while the other terninates at the channel 20. Provided in series with the duct 9 there are two electrical sensors 10a and 1Ob whose output terminals 11 are destined to supply electrical signals roportional to the rate and to the temperature, respectively, of the flow 7 of air passing through the said duct 9. The function of the sensor 1Cb is the same as that of the previously mentioned sensor 6b. E electronic logic group has been shonul at 15 and this is constituted by various sections numbered 15a, 15b, 15c, 15d, 15e, 15f and 15g. The section 15b has the task of sulying the other sections. The function of the section 15a, to which are wired the electrical terminals 7 and 11, is to effect the neasurenents through corresponding analogue signals of the mass rate of the aforementioned flows V and .4. The said analogue signals are converted into corresponding digital signals by the analogue digital conversion section 15c, and are then passed on to the digital logic analysis section 15d.The section 15d processes, in accordance with the program mes inserted therein, in which are pre established the values of the mixing ratio it is wished to obtain at the tine the engine is started up and when it is running at various different speeds, the digital signals coming from the section 15c and, on the basis of the said processing operation, supplies information signals to the negative feedback section 15f. 3ased on the information received, the section 15f oterates the power section 15g whose final actuator is constituted by a solenoid 5a. 2he section 15c works in conjunction with the section 15e that is destined to decode data intended, for example, to be set out on a display device 14 of a known type. The solenoid 5a is fed with unidirectional signals, not necessarily constant in amplitude, at variable resuen cies in other words, the solenoid 5a is energized with impulses, the amplitude of which can vary as a consequence of external causes for example a variation in the battery supply voltage but the frequency of which is regulated by the section 15f in accordance with what has been outlined above.As is kno n, by varying the supply voltage frequency of a solenoid a resulting variation is made in the flow rele vant thereto, and this involves a regulation o ,2 the force with which the armature Sb is attracted by the solenoid 5a. A description will no.r be given of how the apparatus forning the subject of the invention operates. As stated above, the nixing ratio it is wished to obtain at the various speeds of the engine, particularly at the time it is being started up, is pre established in the programme inserted in the section 15d. In the present context, the term started upt is meant to imply a pre determined period of time that follows the ignition phase. lhe ignition of the engine with the simultaneous oFerat ion of the section 15b is accompanied by the formation of 2 vacuum in the channel 2C which, as is kno n, is dependent on the opening degree of the throttle valve of the carburettor 12 and this induces a flow 2 of air and a flow V of gaseous fuel since imnediately the engine fires, the armature 5b moves away, though only slightly, fron the closing configuration C .The task of the apparatus in question consists, as already stated several tines, in obtaining a pre established air fuel mixing ratio for the mixture present in the chant nel 20. Since, in this particular case, no control exists as regards the delivery of air flow P , steps are taken to regulate the delivery of fuel flow V . this is achieved by controlling the passage area defined by the valve 5 which, between the two limit configurationsC and A, namely the closing and maximum opening configur ation, adopts a plurality of working configurations L in respect of the passage area S of the flow V.In each configuration L, the armature 5b is kept in balance since it is subjected to the force T1 influenced b external electrical factors but adjustable through variations in the supply voltage frequency of the solenoid via , and to a force 22 identical but in the opposite direction to 21 due to the thrust that the flow V exerts on the said valve as the said flow transits across the passage area S.Should there be a dissimilarity between the true ratio of the mixture flow M and that programmed, consequential information is supplied to the section 15f by the section 15d. In this way, the frequency of the solenoid 5a is varied so that the armature 5b be carried into a fresh configuration of balance L such that the delivery of fuel flow V can return the mixing ratio to the programmed value. t rom the foregoing it thus ensues that, except for anom nlous conditions of operation for example starting up, acceleration and deceleration etcetera it is possible with the apparatus in question to maintain the mixing ratio constant independently both of the number of revolutions and of any external disturbing cause of a pingsical chemical nature, as regards the air and the fuel OT 2 mecnaiiical nature, as regards the components of the apparatus and of an electrical nature, as regards, or example, the supplying of the electronic logic group 15.The choice of the said ratio is either a function of con sump tion minimization or of the particular performance of a sports nature it is wished the engine to yield.For the purpose of achieving a higher performance, it is possible to provide the section 15d with a programme that defines a pre established functional relationship between the ixing ratio and the number of revolutions of the engine this involves the provision of a transducer 13 de picked in dashes and connected to the section 15a destined to supply an electrical signal for neasuring the speed of the said engine.the display device 14 illustrated in Figure 1 for example of the seven segment type is destined to show a reading of the consumption of fuel, a reading of the fuel level in the tank 1, a reading of the battery charging voltage, a reading of the speed of the driving shaft, and indications pertaining to consunptions and the distance covered etcetera, or singly any one of the foregoing.The apparatus in question, in addition to the prior listed advantages, allows the construction of the pressure reduc . ing valve vaporizer 2 to be simplified and, furthermore, is suitable for the full range of motor vehicles and stat ior engines marketed at the resent time. A further advantage of the apparatus is that no calibration is needed should one or more component parts have to be replaced.It is understood that the above description has been given purely as an unlinited example and thus that all possible constructional detail variations for example the meas urement of the delivery rate of the flows V and F can be effected with one single sensor instead of with a pair of sensors fall within the technical solution as described above and clained hereinafter.
