# N N 1 LOBED ROTARY FLUID PUMPS

## Abstract
In an N, N 1 lobe type pump, dirt clearances are provided at the bases of the interlobe roots 22 of the annulus 14 and the shaping and dimensioning of the inner rotor and annulus are such that elsewhere there is a normal running clearance at the zones of drive contact between the two rotors. To prevent the creation of excessive clearances in the positions of full mesh especially at position D, the inner rotor 10 and annulus 14 are conjugate as defined such that at positions B and D normal running clearances are maintained.
