# Apparatus for detecting containers having a deviating property.

## Abstract
The invention to an apparatus for detecting containers having at least one property deviating from a previously set standard, said containers comprising a convex, circular symmetrical reflecting upper rim, said apparatus comprising an illumination station and a video camera for forming a video signal corresponding with the video picture of the upper rim of a container to be checked, a video signal processing unit for comparing the video picture with the picture corresponding with the standard previously set, and generating in dependency of the result of said comparison an approval or rejection signal, respectively. The invention has for its purpose to engineer such an apparatus in such a way that it operates very reliably, can be used for substantially all classes of containers and is adapted to assess the properties of the upper rim of the containers and furthermore the degree of crookedness of these containers, and provides thereto an apparatus of the type set forth above, which is characterized in that said video signal processing unit is adapted for separating the video picture in two mirror symmetrical parts with respect to a line extending perpendicularly to the picture lines, further characterized in that means are present for counting the number of representative picture information elements per picture line in each of said both parts and for mutually comparing them, and in that means are present for comparing the result of said comparison with the video picture corresponding with the standard previously set and generating in dependency of the result of said comparison, an approval or rejection signal, respectively.
