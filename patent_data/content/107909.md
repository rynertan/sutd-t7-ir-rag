# Low emission valve.

## Abstract
A low emission valve assembly 10 for use with volatile fluids and incorporating a pair of independent inner 117 and outer 131 metal bellows mechanical seal assemblies with means to compensate for thermal expansion of a liquid between the seals and which means transmits product pressure within the valve to the seals, so that the inner seal 117 floats with a near zero pressure differential from outside to inside. The compensating means can be a pressure responsive bellows 136 arrangement or a press ure response diaphragm arrangement 200 .
