## Description
DUAL WHEEL CASTER ASSEMBLY The invention concerns a dual wheel caster assembly. Dual wheel casters have found considerable acceptance in recent years for supporting such items as office equipment and furniture. Their success is a result of a combination of factors including the increased load capacity of the dual wheel construction, which permits the caster to be made from less expensive materials. An additional advantage in the dual wheel caster design is that they swivel more readily than single wheel casters because the wheels have the capacity to rotate in opposite directions as the caster pivots. In many cases it has been found desirable to provide brakes for dual wheel caster assemblies, particularly in casters used for supporting office equipment that is normally stationary. Many types of brakes have been devised in the past for locking caster wheels to brake horns or bases, but most of these have been specifically designed for single wheel casters. In one type of single wheel caster brake, a plate is mounted on the main wheel axle for pivotal movement and it has a cam surface that axially engages and binds against and locks the wheel of the caster.Another type of single wheel caster brake includes a pivotally mounted number on the horn that wedges against the outer tread surface of the wheel and frictionally locks the wheel to the horn. These, and other brake assemblies, are adequate for single wheel caster assemblies but they are not parti cularly suitable for dual wheel caster assemblies because the wheels in dual wheel caster constructions are spaced quite far apart and adapting a single wheel type of braking mechanism for both wheels would result in not only a complicated brake construction, but also one which would detract from the aesthetic appearance of the caster which is important in today s modern office environment. There has not been one dual wheel caster assembly that has been modified to accommodate a brake that frictionally engages and locks, or attempts to lock, both wheels of the caster. This prior construction utilizes a bracket carrying brake shoes that extend axially over the outer surface of the wheels. The brake is actuated by a camming lever mounted centrally in the horn and deactuated by a return spring in the horn. This brake assembly has the primary disadvantage that it can only be used in horn assemblies that have hoods that cover the periphery of the wheels since otherwise the brake shoes would be visible and detract from the appearance of the caster.Another disadvantage in this construction is that the braking force is controlled by the position of the braking lever and thus subject to human error in positioning of the lever, and it is also subject to the inadvertent release of the brake by bumping the lever or even vibration of the equipment supported on the casters. In accordance with the present invention, a dual wheel caster is provided that has a brake assembly that provides a predetermined and controlled braking force and does not detract from the aesthetic appearance of the caster. Toward this end, the present caster assembly includes an arcuate central horn that may or may not have a hood covering wheels rotatably mounted in an axle carried centrally by the horn. The horn carries a pintle assembly that projects vertically upwardly that is adapted to be connected to the office equipment, furniture or other article to be supported by the caster. Each of these wheels has an annular recess facing the horn that defines an inwardly facing cylindrical brake drum surface that is not visible externally of the caster regardless of whether the horn has a hood covering the wheels or not. The brake assembly includes a generally U shaped bracket mounted for radial movement in a slot in the horn, that carries spaced arcuate rubber molded brake shoes flanking the sides of the horn that project within the adjacent annular recesses in the wheels and selectively engage the inwardly facing drum surfaces on the wheels. The braking force is controlled and provided solely by a coil compression spring mounted in the same horn slot, engaging and biasing the brake shoe bracket outwardly. The brake shoes are released by a pivotal lever mounted in the periphery of the horn adjacent the bracket that has a two position cam that shifts the brake shoe bracket radially inwardly upon actuation to release the brake shoes from the wheel drum surfaces. This brake assembly has the primary advantages that the braking force is controlled and determined entirely by the force of the coil compression spring and it may not be inadvertently released by bumping from a foreign object or by vibration of the associated supported equipmentAn additional and very important advantage is that the brake assembly does not require any redesign of the outer configuration of the horn or wheels, with the exception of the pivotal deactuating lever, a feature which is important in the modern office environment. Moreover the brake assembly is usable equally on casters having horns with or without hoods that cover the wheels. In the drawings Fig. 1 is a perspective view of the present dual wheel caster assembly with spring loaded brake Fig. 2 is a partly fragmentary side view illustrating the brake assembly in an actuated position Fig. 3 is a cross section taken generally along line 3 3 of Fig. 1 illustrating the brake assembly in an actuated position Fig. 4 is a fragmentary section taken generally along line 3 3 of Fig. 3 Fig. 5 is a side view of the caster assembly according to the present invention similar to Fig. 2 with the brake assembly shown in its deactuated position Fig. 6 is a cross section similar to Fig. 3 with the brake assembly shown in its deactuated position Fig. 7 is a fragmentary section taken generally along line 707 of Fig. 6 Fig. 8 is a longitudinal section taken generally along line 8 8 of Fig. 7 and Fig. 9 is a longitudinal section taken generally along line 9 9 of Fig. 7 illustrating the rear side of the brake shoe bracket. Referring to the drawings, the present caster assembly 10 is seen to generally include a hoodless central horn 11 that rotatably carries wheels 12 and 13 at either side thereof and has a vertical pintle assembly 15 projecting upwardly for insertion into cooperating elements carried by the office equipment, furniture or other article to be supported. While horn 11 is a hoodless horn, it should be understood that the principles of the present invention apply equally well to horns having hoods that partly or completely cover the periphery of the wheels 12 and 13. As seen in Figs. 2 and 3, the horn 11 is a one piece molding that has a central hub portion 17 with a central bore 18 that receives an axle 19 in nonrotatable relationship. As seen in Fig. 4, the axle 19 projects on both sides of horn 11 and rotatably receives and supports the wheels 12 and 13. The wheels 12 and 13 have central closed end bores with integral annular detents permitting the wheels to be snapped onto the ends of the axle 19 and locked axially thereto. The central hub 17 of the horn 11 is interconnected to arcuate peripheral portion 21 by integral spoke portions 22, 23, 24 and 25. Horn 11 has an integral boss portion 27 with a vertical closed ended bore therein not shown that receives the pintle assembly 15. According to the present invention, a spring loaded brake assembly 28 is provided for the caster 10 and is seen to include a radially extending slot 29 in the horn completely axially therethrough and defined by side surfaces 31 and 32 connected to an inner surface 34 by generally radial tapered surfaces 36 and 37, and outer surface 38. A generally U shaped brake shoe bracket 40 is mounted for radial movement in slot 29 and as seen in Fig. 4, it includes a base portion 41 and upstanding leg portions 42 and 43 that flank and are guided by side surfaces 45 and 46 on periphery portion 48 of the horn 11. As seen more clearly in Figs. 8 and 9, bracket 40 has outwardly projecting tabs 46 and 47 flanking leg 42 and outwardly projecting tabs 49 and 50 flanking tab 43. A rubber brake shoe 51 is molded around tabs 46 and 47, and an identical rubber brake shoe 52 is molded around tabs 49 and 50. The brake shoes 51 and 52 have arcuate brake surfaces 54 and 55. As seen in Figs. 4 and 7, the wheels 12 and 13 are identical and they each have annular recesses 57 and 58 in each of the integral wheel spokes, facing the horn 11 and defined by frustoconical surface 59, flat annular radial surface 60 and an annular cylindrical drum surface 61. The recesses 57 and 58define an overhanging annular rim lip 63 on tread 64 of each of the wheels 12 and 13. The brake shoes 51 and 52 engage the drum surfaces 61 to lock the wheels 12 and 13 to the horn. The brake assembly 28 is actuated by a coil compression spring 66 mounted in slot 29. Spring 66 is retained on slot surface 34 by an integral radial projection 68 thereon, and the other end of the spring engages the back surface of the brake shoe bracket base portion 41, biasing the entire bracket and brake shoes 51 and 52 radially outwardly. A brake release lever 70 is provided for releasing the brake shoes 51 and 52 from engagement with the wheel drum surfaces 61. Lever 70 has an arcuate tab portion 71 to facilitate brake actuation and release by the operator s foot. As seen in Figs. 3, 4, 7 and 8, the lever 70 is carried in a rec tangular slot 72 in the peripheral portion 48 of the horn 11 and is pivotally mounted therein by a pin 73 pressed into the horn peripheral portion 48.Lever 70 has a flat cam portion 74 connected to a curved cam portion 75 that engage the brake shoe bracket portion 41 as lever 70 is pivoted in a clockwise direction from its position shown in Fig. 3 to its position shown in Fig.6, shifting the bracket 40 radially inwardly and disengaging the brake shoes 51 and 52 from the cooperating drum surfaces 61 on the wheels 12 and 13. The flat cam portion 74 on the lever engages the bracket in the Fig. 6 position holding the bracket in its disengaged position with the brake shoes 51 and 52 out of contact with drum surfaces 61.This action compresses spring 66 and stores energy in the spring for the subsequent actuation of the brake 28. In operation, and with the brake 28 disengaged as seen in Figs. 5, 6 and 7, the operator depresses lever 70 by foot in a counterclockwise direction to its position shown in Figs. 2 and 3. This action completely releases the bracket 40 from the cam surfaces of lever 70, permitting the energy stored in the coil compression spring 66 to rapidly snap the bracket 40 radially outwardly and the brake shoes 51 and 52 carried thereby into engagement with the wheel cylindrical drum surfaces 61. This locks the wheels 12 and 13 to the horn 11 immobilizing the article supported by the caster. The braking force of the brake assembly 28 can be accurately and easily controlled by the appropriate selection of the coil compression spring 66 since only this spring controls the effective braking force. Because lever 70 is completely free of the bracket 40 when the brake is in the engaged position as seen in Figs. 3 and 4, the inadvertent bumping of the lever 70 or vibration of the support ed article cannot cause the inadvertent release of the brake. It may be readily seen from Figs. 4 and 7, that the horn 11 could be provided with a hood extending axially outwardly from the horn and covering the wheels 12 and 13, if desired, without altering the configuration of the horn or hood in ny way,
