# High frequency amplifier with distortion compensation.

## Abstract
HF amplifier device comprising a first transistor which is controlled at its base by a signal source and whose collector is connected to a load, also comprising a second transistor for compensating for the distortion occurring in the first transistor. According to the invention, this distortion is measured by comparing the collector output voltage of the first transistor with the collector voltage of a so called third transistor, which is highly linearized by means of negative emitter feedback and which evidences a similar voltage gain as the first transistor and whose base is coupled to the base of the first transistor. Said distortion is thereafter compensated for in the forward direction by using the collector difference voltage of the first and third transistor as a control voltage for a second transistor which is connected to the load as an emitter follower. This results at the same time in a low output impedance of the HF amplifier device.

## Description
High frequency amplifier with distortion compensation. The invention relates to a HF tplifier device comprising a first transistor which is controlled at its base by a signal source and whose collector constitutes the output of the HF arrplifier device and is connected to a load, also comprising a second transistor. and a third transistor with negative emitter feedback whose base is coupled to the base of the first transistor, the second transistor being coupled as an emitter follower to the collector of the third transistor and coupled through its emitter to the collector of the first transistor and through its collector to a supply voltage. Such an HF amplifier device is disclosed in the article An integrated IF anplifier by W.J. Mc Calla, published in IEEE Journal ofSolid State Circuits , viol. SC 8, no. 6, December 1973, pages 440 447. The output impedance of the prior art HF amplifier device is determined by the emitter output impendance of the second transistor and may consequently he sufficiently low to short circuit for exarrple signal reflections in the load at the output of the HF arrplifier device or to reduce the influence of variations in the load inpedance on the output voltage The gain of the known HF amplifier device is mainly determined by the first transistor and to a lesser extent also by the second transistor. If a high gain is desired, the distortion occurring in the second transistor will have a relatively great effect on the overall distortion as the distortion occurring in the first transistor is partly short circuited to ground via the second transistor, without passing through the load. The invention has for its object to provide an HF amplifier device of the type set forth in the opening paragraph, which distorts to a lesser extent than said prior art HF artplifier device. According to the invention, an HF amplifier of this type is characterized in that the voltage gain of the first transistor is substantially equal to the gain of the third transistor. When the measure according to the invention is used, a reliable reference of the wanted output voltage is obtained at the collector of the third transistor which is highly linearized hy the negative emitter feedback, Variations between this reference and the output voltage produced by the first transistor are ccapensated for by means of the second transistor.As these variations are only caused by the distortion occurring in the first transistor and as the base emitter voltage of the second transistor is only determined by these variations, the variation of this base emitter voltage and consequently also the distortion occurring in the second transistor is rmch lesser than in said prior art HF aNpli fier device, whereas the distortion of the first transistor is completely ccmpensated. A preferred embodl2ent of an HF artplifier device according to the invention is balanced and characterized by fourth, fifth and sixth transistors which are balanced relative to the respective first, second and third transistors, the load being connected between the collectors of the first and fourth transistors. When this measure is applied the load current is free from direct currents and only the HFutput signal current of the HF amplifier devices flows through it. Such a construction is furthermDre particularly suitable for use as a prearrplifier for an acoustic filter. The invention will now be further described by way of example with reference to the Figure in the acconpanying drawings. Herein Figure 1 shows an HF amplifier device according to the invention. Figure 2 shows a balanced construction of the HF amplifier device of Figure 1 comprising an acoustic filter as a load. Figure 1 shows an HF artplifier device according to the inven tion, comprising a first transistor T1i r a so called third transistor T3 the base thereof being coupled with that of the first transistor T1 and a second transistor T2 which is connected as an emitter follower between the collectors of these two transistors T1 and T3. The bases of the first and third transistors T1 and T3 are connected in common to an input signal source S, their collectors are connected to a supply voltage via a load ZL and a collector resistor R3 respectively and the emitters are connected to ground via the respective emitter resistors R1 and D .The emitter of the second transistor T2 is coupled to the collector of T1, the base to the collector of T3 and the collector to a supply voltage. With the aid of the emitter resistor R1 the transadmittance of the first transistor T1 is set such that starting from a given load irrpe dance ZL and a given amplitude of the base input signal the desired output signal amplitude is obtained, or at least approxunated at the ocllecw tor of T1. To that end the emitter resistor R1 may be cq aratively small and may be replaced by a current source, not shown, which is short circuited for high frequency by means of a parallel capacitance.This may cause the signal variation across the non linear wltagewcurrent characteristic of the base emitter diode of the first transistor T1 to be paratively large, which may result in a considerable distortion, in the collector output current of T1. The distortion component of this collector output current is compensated by the emitter current of the anitter follower T2, such that the output voltage of the HF amplifier device, that is to say the voltage across the load ZL as the result of the total output current applied thereto, follows the collector voltage of the third transistor T3. By linearizing the third transistor T3, it is accomplished that the lastmentioned collector voltage and consequently also the output voltage of the HF anrplifier device varies without distortion versus the base input voltage.To that end, the emitter resistor R2 is chosen such, in a manner known per se, that the voltage variation across the baseemifter diode of this third transistor T3 is at least smaller than the voltage variation of the first transistor T1 and does not cause a noticeable distortion of the collector current. Consequently, the emitter resistor R2 is generally many times larger than the emitter resistor R1. Starting from a collector current of T3 thus obtained, which varies linearly versus the base input voltage, the amplitude of the ool lector voltage, and consequently, also the arglitude of the output voltage of the HF arrplifier device can be adjusted to a desired value by means of the collector resistor R3. If the voltage gain of the first and third transistors T1 andT3 correspond to each other then the said emitter current of T2 predominantly corresponds to the distortion component in the collector output current of the first transistor T1, as a result of which this distortion component is short circuited to ground via the second transistor T2 without flowing through the load ZL If the voltage gains of the first and third transistors T1 andT3 deviate somewhat from each other, for exaMple because of a change in the load impedance ZL then the second transistor T2 produces an emitter current which not only contains the said distortion component but also a signal component.This signal component produces across the load ZL a voltage which compensates for the voltage difference between on the one hand the collector voltage of T3 which functions as a reference and on the other hand the voltage across the load ZL as a result of the collec tor output current of T1. HF signal voltage reflections from the load ZL towards the HF artplifier device are shunted to ground via the second transistor T2, so that with, for example, acoustic filters when used as load ZL socalled triple transient reflections are avoided. Figure 2 shows a practical balanced construction of the HFamplifier device of Figure 1 in which corresponding components are given the same reference numerals. The first transistor T1 forms together with a fourth transistorT4 a first balanced differential amplifier having mutually equal seriesarranged emitter resistors R1 and R4 and a setting current source which is connected to ground and to the oommDn junction of R1 and R4. The second transistor T2 forms together with a fifth transistor T5 a second balanced differential amplifier which is arranged in cascode between the first balanced differential amplifier and the supply voltage.The third transistor T3 forms together with a sixth transistor T6 a third balanced differential amplifier which is arranged in parallel with the first balanced differential amplifier with mutually equal series arranged emitter resistors R2 and R5, the common junction thereof being connected to a grounded setting current source S2 and with mutually equal collector resistors R3 and R6 which are arranged between the respective collectors of the transistors T3 and T6 and the supply voltage. The balanced base inputs of the first and third differential amplifiers are jointly connected to the input signal source S which is now of a balanced construction.The base inputs of the second differential amplifier are connected to the collector outputs of the third differential amplifier and its emitter outputs are connected on the one hand to the collectors of the first and fourth transistors T1 and T4 of the first differential amplifier, and on the other hand to the load ZL which in the given application is formed by an acoustic filter, which is illustrated by a parallel RDC network RLC. The functions of the said first, second and third differential amplifiers correspond to the respective functions of the first, second and third transistors of the HF amplifier device shown in Figure 1. However, in contrast with the embodiment shown in Figure 1, in which the load ZL also conveys a direct current which produces a d.c.voltage across the load Z,, corresponding to the oollector emitter voltage of the emitter follower T2, such a direct current through the loadZL is avoided in the balanced construction shown in Figure 1. In a practical embodiment comprising an acoustic TV IF filter as a load ZL wherein R 2 Kn, L 1.9 ,uH and C 10 pF, the HF ampli fier device functioned as a TV IF preamplifier and the setting currents sources S1 and S2 had the respective values 1.2 mA and 6.2 mA and the resistors R1 and R6 had the respective values 45 , 400 , 8 k Q, 45 , 400 Q and 8 kn. It will be obvious that the invention is not limited to the constructions described in the foregoing and that several alternatives are conceivable within the scope defined by the Claims. It is alternatively possible to connect instead of an acoustic filter a signal processing circuit of a different type as a load to the output of the HFamplifier device, or, for example, a cable for signal distribution in a community antenna system.
