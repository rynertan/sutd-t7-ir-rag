# Electrostatic adsorptive fluid filtering apparatus.

## Abstract
An electrostatic adsorptive fluid filtering apparatus wherein an adsorbent provided in a flow path of fluid to be treated has adsorption capacity as well as adsorption power substantially improved as as a result of enhancement of a potential inherently carried by the adsorbent on its adsorptive hole surface by impressing a DC voltage onto a charging elec trode provided with the adsorbent or by placing the adsorbent in an electric field.
