# COMPLIANT PIN

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a compliant pin that effects a resilient interference fit within a complementary aperture of a printed circuit board. The pin utilizes an improved three beam configuration that optimizes electrical continuity, load distribution and mechanical stability, yet minimizes insertion force. The compliant pin exhibits contact wiping upon insertion and an anti torque characteristic after insertion.
