# Platinum styrene complexes as catalysts for hydrosilation reactions and a process for preparing the same.

## Abstract
Platinum styrene complexes are prepared by react ing a platinum halide with styrene or substituted sty renes in the presence of a basic material for a sufficient amount of time to form a complex having more than one and less than four gram atoms of halogen per gram atom of platinum. These platinum styrene complexes may be used to promote the addition of organosilicon compounds having at least one SiH group per molecule to a compound containing aliphatic unsaturation.
