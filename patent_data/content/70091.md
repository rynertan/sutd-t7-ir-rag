# Cable shield termination means for plug and receptacle connectors.

## Abstract
A means for terminating a cable wire shield 16 in an electrical connector 10 can provide effective protection against electromagnetic interference including radio fre quency and electromagnetic pulse interference. A metal plate 18 having at least one opening 20 is fixed in the open end of an electrical connector 10 . In each opening 20 is fixed a hollow metal tube 21 through which the cable wires 15 pass. The metal shield 16 surrounding the cable wires 15 is electrically and mechanically fixed as a sleeve over the tube 21 and the plate 18 is secured to the connector shell 11 by means of a hollow metal adaptor 23 which passes over the cable and, when fixed to the connector, maintains the metal plate 18 in firm contact with the connector shell.
