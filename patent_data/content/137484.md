# Positioning device for button setting machines.

## Abstract
A positioning device 10 comprises a reciprocally movable support table 14 having a surface 14a extending in a plane above a clinching die 12 of a button setting machine 11 for supporting a garment fabric to which a button A is attached, and a pair of guide mambers 15, 16 disposed on the surface 14a in perpendicular relation. The table 14 includes a recess 22 which is registered with the clinching die 12 when the table is in an advanced position. One of the guide member 15 is positionally adjustable in a direction perpendicular to the direction of movement of the table 14 and the other guide member 16 is positionally adjustable in a direction parallel to the direction of move ment of the table 14 . Thus the garment fabric can be positioned accurately and easily with respect to the clinching die 12 by simply putting two adjacent edges of the garment fabric into guided engagement with the respective guide members 15, 16 . The positioning device may includes a stopper mechanism 35 for limiting reciprocation of the table 14 at the advanced position and a retracted position remote from the clinching die 12 .
