# Apparatus for separating solid particles from a liquid.

## Abstract
An apparatus for separating solid particles, such as amalgam waste from waste water in dentists surgical units, is described. The apparatus comprises a closed, liquid filled container 1 having an inlet 2 and an outlet 3 and incorporating at least one sedimentation zone 4, 12 and at least one filter body 6, 13 . The sedimentation zone prefer ably comprises an absorption material, such as alumina fibres. The filter body 6, 13 which may be provided for vertical or horizontal liquid throughflow, consists of filter medium balls which preferably are made of alumina and have a diameter of 0.5 15 mm, enclosed between two perforated walls 8, 9 . The filter body is self cleaning in that it is not completely filled with filter balls, and in that the balls have a density such that they either float in or are carried along by the liquid passing through the separation container 1 so that the balls are collected against the perforated wall of the filter body emitting the liquid, whereby the filter medium balls are set in motion by the flowing liquid and rubbed against each other.
