# Material handling and sorting system.

## Abstract
Mechanised mail sorting offices require packets to be sorted according to destination into one of many bags. A typical mechanised system includes a loading mechanism for transferring packets from stationary input pockets onto a continuously moving sequence of containers which pass all destinations in turn and unload as required. The system according to the invention consists of a number of separate self powered single trolleys TL which run on a tracking network. Each trolley TL is adapted to be programmed with the route to be taken to the destination of the packet s loaded into it. The trolley TL co operates with en route track side signposts TSB enabling steering means SM in the form of a guide arm at the front of the trolley TL to guide the trolley around the tracking network to and from its required destination for unloading its package into a bag. Programming is done by operators at induction stations ISA, ISB, ISC and ISD at sidings in the tracking network while the trolleys are stationary.
