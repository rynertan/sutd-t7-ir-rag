# Optical recording element and method of optically recording information.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an optical recording element 22 in which information can be recorded and read by means of laser light. The element comprises a circular substrate plate 17 which is manufactured, for example, from a transparent synthetic resin and has a diameter from 5 50 cm and which is provided on at least one side with a recording layer 21 consisting entirely or substantially entirely of a compound of phtalocyanine with a metal, metal oxide or metal halide. A very suitable recording layer is a layer of vapour deposited vanadylphtalocyanine in a maximum thickness of 200 nm. A a metal layer of, for example, tellurium may be provided bet ween the substrate and the recording layer or on the side of the recording layer remote from the substrate. The element may also comprise an optically readable servo track 18 . Upon recording information the element is exposed to pul satory laser light pits and or holes being formed in the record ing layer. Analog recording is possible. The element can be read both in transmission and in reflection.
