# Glucoheptonate composition.

## Abstract
By product ammonium ions remaining in an aqueous solution of a water soluble glucoheptonate salt after its synthesis are reacted with the free acid form of a naphtha lenesulfonic acid formaldehyde condensation product to obtain an aqueous composition which does not produce an ammonia odor when introduced into aqueous media having a pH above 9. The aqueous composition can be dried to obtain a flowable powder. Both the aqueous composition and flowable powder are useful as additives in industrial products. They may be used to prolong the time of hydra tion of cement.
