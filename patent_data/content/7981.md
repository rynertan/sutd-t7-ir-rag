# Sidewall protector for a tire.

## Abstract
A resilient sidewall protector 11 is connected to a rim 13 for protecting a sidewall 18 of a tire 16 mount ed on the rim 13 from cuts and bruises. The protector 11 extends from its connection to the rim 13 radially outwardly along the sidewall 18 and has an intermediate portion 34 shaped to receive the bulge 21 in the side wall 18 of the tire 16 at the footprint area. The outer peripheral portion 33 of the protector 11 is resiliently urged into continuous engagement with the sidewall 18 in response to the protector 11 being connected to the rim 13 .
