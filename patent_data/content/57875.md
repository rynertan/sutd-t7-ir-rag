# Water dispersible hydrophobic thickening agent.

## Abstract
An aqueous liquid medium having increased low shear viscosity as provided by dispersing into the aqueous medium 1 a water soluble polymer having pendant hyd rophobic groups, e.g., an acrylamide dodecyl acrylate copo lymer, and 2 a water dispersible surfactant, e.g., sodium oleate, or dodecyl polyethyleneoxy glycol monoether. The thickened aqueous medium is suitably employed in applica tions requiring viscous liquids which retain their viscosity when subjected to shear, heat or high electrolyte salt concentrations. Such applications include uses in enhanced oil recovery processes, as fluid mobility control agents, fracturing fluids and drilling muds, as well as hydraulic fluids and lubricants in many applications.
