## Description
As expressed by the statements of this descriptive retort, the invention mentioned berewith refers to a system producing electri cal energy and especially to the Aisnosition of its elements in order to obtain its totally original ctzracteristics, which make it differ from anything in the material knots or practiced up to now. It is common knowledge that in the synchronous generators known up to the present, a change in the number of revolutions per minute is not permissible with a constant frequency being maintained. This is due to the cznstruction and design of the inductor being exclusively for a sole speed. The purpose of this invention is to obtain electrical energy by means of the system st2ted in this descriptive reDort, composed of a primary internal combustion or hydraulic turbine engine and an asynchronous alternator with two or more speeds or number of revolutions per minute and a centrifugal electrical regulator, tha speed of which is regulated by this grouping in terms of the frecuency obtained in the alternator. The result of this is a greater saving of energy and less wear on the cited system producing electrical energy. An example of the actual asclic2tion of this system is that of an electrical tower station where greater potential is reouired at peak hours than during the rest of the day, being able to go from less tower to greater or viceversa in various stages. As it is well known, an asynchronous electrical engine knoam at present as a squirrel cage or short circuit electrical motor is capable of generating a low alternating current, between 0.5 and 3 volts, if it is made to turn appropriately and due to the residual magnetism the rotor has since the last time it was polarized. More concretely, if a reactive energy is applied to an asynchro nous motor in the decreasing sen eriods of the sinusoid, the winding of the stator acts at that moment as an inductor on the rotor which1 due to the spiral in iort circuit which forms the mentioned cage constitutive of sod rotor, originates in itself an electromotive forte dlich induced is transformed into magne tic flux. In this way as it continues to turn and during the increasing semi cycles of the sinusoid, it acts as an inductor on the stator itself. Through adequate control of the reactive energy gy applied, the desired output tension is reached.This control is essential not only for increasing the output tension to the planned level but also to impede the motor from saturating itself with the existing risk of its burning out. On applying a charge to the alternator obtained in this way, there is a notable drop in the tension for which reason the ex citation must be increased. A motor can be more or less asynchronous depending directly and in great part on the polar passage of its windings, in such a way that a short passage which does not cover the number of grooves resulting from the division of their total number by the number of poles, has a more accented sliding than the passage that does cover it. It is also true that the intensity of excitation is greater when the passage of the result of the foremen ioned division is lesser.That is, if said excitation is obtained by being based on conden sers, these hill have less capacity when the motor has less shifting. The engine that forms part of the invention described in this resort has two windings in its stator periphery, one of which is used for the useful output in terminal and the other auxiliary one is for controling the tension or for excitation. The main winding used for output has a short passage and a number of grooves inferior to the total corresponding to each pole, using the remaining grooves to house the auxiliary winding. Given that a winding at 100 x 100 utility of its peripheral density in output to receivers would absorb the entire mqgnet c field of the rotor inductor , it is necessary to apply a very high power factor corrector to it which makes the tension recuperation system in inductive charge very costly. As the utilization of the magnetic field of the induced is inferior to the totality of its peripheral density, the remaining density is left free of the influence of the terminal output charge of the cosine of pi as well as the drop in tension, the free space left being for the placing of the auxiliary winding where a potential in stage advance is applied to it. In order to achieve the desired tension there are two means which are scitation and self excitation. Excitation is achieved at the expense of an independent source consisting of a second engine called excitative, which one connected to the other manage to overcome the remaining small amount of tension and by means of a regulator in order, the desired level is reached. Self excitation, as the word indicates, is obtained by the ap plication of its own electric current conveniently prolonged from the crest towards the zero value and during the decreasing half of each sem eriod, provoking in this way a reactive secondary electric current. As in the previol 9 case, a regulator installed in the circuit liiaits the tension to the level desired. The above mentioned regulator will nreferably be electronic and composed of a transistorized aniplifier which is governed bv a zener diode and which taking for reference the tension in the motor will give a signal to some transistors and, or tyristors for automatic regulation in a vacuum or in a full charge. A third system of stabilizing tension has also been planned, consisting of sa.turatingtbe engine on a basis of condensers and without a regulator, in a limit not dangerous for it and to be used where major importance is not given to losses due to heat and with a connection preferably singlephase or tio phase. Since the beginning when the late Edison had his dynamo shunt with the inconvenience of the tension brusquely zropnini to zero value level if a very high power was connected to it. The same happens to synchronous alternators which have a similar connection by means of wave rectification, because when the tension which feeds the excitation drops it produces the return of the self fed energy. As in the same way the asynchronous alternator mentioned in this patent has the same thing occur to it in its primitive way of discovery, teo solutions have been foreseen to avoid this inconvenience and consist of, 1. The forementioned disposition of two windings in which not only the peripheral density is not totally utilized in charging, but also the auxiliary excitation winding is fed by an external surce, generally an excitative. An excitative which only acts to recuperate charging tension when dealing with small alternators since the majority of these are easily excited by installing in them a condenser in tl e output of the motor and in tle auxiliary winding. 2. The addition of an absorption element in the engine output towards the terminals, generating a tension with saturation suner ior to the normal. Said element consists of a reactance or trans former installed in series absorbing the remaining voltage, and using this circuit only in the case of the tension a level determined as excessively low and not acting normally in the case of gradual charges.The absorption element and circuit used in the excitative are to avoid such a phenomenon hap pening to the auxiliary source, ti ereby achieving that the group ing formed by these components give the alternator the sanc char acteristics as the conventional alternators. Given the characteristics previously exposed, there is implied a series of advantages which the asynchronous alternator presents as opn3 ed to conventional synchronous generators, among which the follo ing are worthy of notice Considering that the shifting velocity is inverse to that of the asynchronous motors, in order to achieve the nominal frequency it is necessary to have a velocity superior to that of the synchronism and not producing heat with this phenomenon, there is an increase in the tension and that by means of this a new calculation permits reducing the number of spirals to achieve the tension desired, with which the section of the conductor of the winding is augmented and conseauently increasing the power. There is a notable reduction in the cost of the generating motor as there is no cost of labour in the electric construction of the rotor, since it is dealing with the squirrel cage, its construction is purely mechanical. There is as well a notable reduction in the risk of disintegration of the rotor as same is of very solid construction. With the addition of a wifier the motor is applicable to the charging of storage batteries and consequently their use in cars, aviation, soldering, etc. The rotor can reach very high velocities, for example 20,000 R.P.Iq. and in conseouence very high frequencies which are essential for the utilization of hertzian waves. The generator thusly obtained notably prolongs its life of usefulness by having the rotor inalterable to mechanical vibrations, which are the cause of ap roximately 90 of the inutilization of the rotors synchronous in generator sets moved by diesel motors. On the other hand it has no brushes, which eliminates any main tcnance service in this sense and which is necessary for the alternators knoazn on the market. Also achievedis a notable reduction in the percentage of losses in the form of heat by not having consumtion in the form of homic resistance in the rotor and by having the stator smaller than the one in conventional synchronous generators, which in turn results in lower energy conswmption. Its upkeep and vigilance is reduced to the maximum, which permits its shielding or hermeticization for determined applicant ons. It permits greater perfection in the regular on of tension by phases, with unbalanced charges, to the limit of intensity equally by phases. The number of revolutions per minute can also be changed by means of a switch and a polarization exciter, an asynchronous alternator being able to hrve several velocities for the normal running rate for a set nominal frequency. This possibility in turn facilitates making a generator set, for example 3f 752, 1,550 and 3,550 R.P.N. with a potential of 50, 100 and 233 g.W.H. being able to choose the most idoneous one for each case by simply effecting the appropriate changes on the control panel. In this way one obtains a considerable savings in energy which results to be impossible with any of the synchronous generators known up to this moment. The output tension can also be changed with a sim ple switch within a wide range of standardized values. The staggering of velocities can be manual or automatic, with manual operation having a switch with as many positions as the motor speeds, and on which the desired velocity can be selected.And the variety of automatic operation has a device on which after the said alternator being at its maximum intensity for a determined no nod of time, activates a comniutater controlled by an electromagnet and connects the alternator to another higher velocity. Reciprocally when the intensity is very low and after an equally determined time as according to a temporizer device, the inverse operation is effected. It would be absurd to hide the inconveniences of the system, as on passing from one velocity to another and during the period of acceleration or deceleration, there is the disadvantage of having an alteration in the frequency during which and until the stabilization of the cycle, alters the functioning of some receivers, as for example, record players with synchronous or asynchronous motors, videos, etc. Iiowever it is unimPortant in lighting, radio,etc mentioned alteration can De rectified by using momentaneously a synchronized generator set before and after changing velocities, or by using. an electric current generator with nominal tension and frequency fed by the energy produced by its own system in the last circuit or velocity in service and nrevitu sly accumulated for its sufficient duration, lor the feeding and maintenance of the circuit or velocity following its being tut into operation and disconnectinE itself autotnatically once the cycle has been equally stabilized. hen the production system of electric energy mentioned as the object of this report is functioning automatically, it has two op tions in order to correct the cited problem. The previously men tioned generator will preferably be electronic and of the set fre quency oscillator type fed by a direct current source and an elec trolytic accumulator or condenser for lowower alternators. The second option will be a second alternator with the first and working as a motor, with a flywheel of inertia in its drive shaft in order to accumulate mechical energy, connecting itself equally before and after the velocity changing operation, and disconnecting itself once the cited cycle has been stabilized. The frequency regulation will be commanded by a centrifugal electric rgultor, which, on receiving an alteration in frequen cy varies the speed of its electric motor which ill be synchro nus or asynchronous in order to suffer this alteration.This activates the counterweights which in turn by means of the mechanism that seconds them transmits the movement realized to a connecting rod in command and same through another external transmission to the acceleration rack of the injection pump and dig tributor, this being an internal combustion motor or to the acceleration butterfly, equally an internal combustion motor, regulotion which corrects in turn the frequency error due to the actual ajifting of the asynchroni Sm. An important reduction of the initial urice of the installation is obtained as well in the weight, volume and cost of an electric power station installed with this system. In parallel to this lot of advantages, the asynchronous generator being advocated herewith presents some disadvantages a few of which have seen mentioned since the object is to make them known. In asynchronous generators with various velocities, there is the drawback that on not being able to change the angle of inclination of the grooves on the rotor, and with said inclination being the appropriate one for only one speed, in the others there is a slight loss of potential as this supposas the production of harmonics which can be problematic in certain cases. Taking as a solution an intermediate inclination of said angle for the range of velocities employed, this drawback is negligible. Evidently tSe problem due to this small loss of potential is sensibly less important than the advantage offered by being able to have available a production system of electrical energy with several working speeds and conseouently a considerable saving of energy. At continuation complete descriotion of the above mentioned Patent will be made with reference to the olans accomnanying same, in which the preferred manner of realization is presented simply as an example, not at all limitative and susceptible to all those modificatins in detail which do not alter fundamentally its es sential characteristics.

An example of appli cation of Figure 15 being applicable to any motor, without keep ing in mind the number of cylinders. In view of these figiires one can observe how the production sys tem of electric energy here advocated is constituted of ausquirrel cage asynchronous generator that, as previously said, has a rotor of the same name or in short circuit, with two types of windings in the stator One simple like those of the motors common to the schemes 1, 2 and 7 through which circulate two currents which are The main one owing to the nominal charge tension and that of exci tation owing to the tension proceeding from the excitative Figures 1 and 2 or proceeding from the excitation unit owing to true ten sion proceeding from the simple excitation unit Figure 7 .Another double or multiple one consisting a a main one that is in charge of supplying useable power from the motor terminals. nothersim plc or multiple one through which the excitatin current is received FIgures 3,4,5 and 6 , this operation is effected being supplied by the excitative, for schemes 3 and 4 d schemes 5 and 6Y it is effected through the excitation and control unit. The reference point is generally made in c terminal output or at distance depending on the needs of its installation. In order to excite. .an asynchronous alternator it is enough sup plying it with reactive energy, this being achieved with a second motor 2 which connected in parallel manages the correct working of the main motor. Just as we speak of an alternator in the full extension of the word, we can equally speak of excitation if dealing with a synchronous generator, in which the power X is taken and witch is usually 1 103 of the total potential in K,V.e. aten we speak of the asynchronous motor which is in part object of tis invention, it can be augmented limitlessly in such a way that it can be greater than .the motor itself, Figures 1,2 and 7 or self excited with a condenser of determined capacity in order to obtain the tension in a vacuum, and the increase of said capacity is by means of the connection in stages of several condensers controlled by the previously mentioned control unit. 6 . But since some circuits would not have in this way practical application due to the control system or excitative being very costly an absorption element has been interpolated between the generator and the terminals output figures 10 and 12 , consisting of a saturable reactance or a short circuit transformer. Therefore the tension causing saturation of the motor is superior to the nominal so when the drop in tension in the terminals is of a value determined to be lower than that of conventional rcsulation, the previously cited element enters into action absorbing the difference in tension between that of saturation and the output at terminals, as the reference of the control unit is taken at said output. In order for said absorption element to be made ineffective, the control unit and two tyristors connected narallelly and in opno sition Drovoke a short circuit in the reactance. For sin city in the regulation and control circuit and as much as possible for low powers, a triad is utilized instead of two trystors as these have a very limited electrical intensity. The use of a transformer instead of a reactance is due to that the latter should not be saturated as if it gives the exact tension of absorption on the secondary, same is reduced from the output line. For this trnnsformer to be made ineffective, the primary is disconnected from the mains and s rtort circuited by means of the regulation and control unit to which a disconnection circuit from the mentioned primary has been added and is controlled as Drevioubly by a zener diode 3nod amplified in order to obtain the gateway strength of the trystors or triad. Dhe latter having the advantage over the circuit of reactance, a S the strength intensity of the primary and the tension off same is superior to the secondary, consequently the strength is less and therefore the importance of the electronic short circuit components is also less. Absorption element and control system which is also interpolated between both motors, a control unit being installed exclu sively for this purpose figure 4 , taking its reference in the above mentioned output from terminals when there is only this lat tcr element or if it exists parallelly li th the previously cited ek ment ith the purpose of simplifying the electronic system. Another option of the alternator system which is also recommended is this report is that of a motor which does not utilize all its peripheral stator density or from an induced secondary figures 3,4,5 and 6 since in this way with there being output power in reserve, not only does the tension drop less brusquely..but the remaining density is left free from being fed by the excitative, or excitation unit based on condensers, thereby achieving a motor of such oroDortions in which a short circuit in the output from terminals does not totally nullify the magnetic field of the excitation, being able to start a very powerful electric motor without departing from the international norms demanded of industrial alternators. A third system of excitftion and control applicable to motors with double stator winding is that of an alternator saturated by the excitative or not, ad that las between its windings a difference in tension and, or in phase so that on connecting them narallelly an intensity strength between them is produced and consequently in a previously y determined magnitude, a cosine fav durable to the purposes of this invention which is capable of takiitg the excitation from the motor in questi on and in eonse ouence not having in this report mention of reactances producing this phenomenon which, by means of a control unit a rorriate for this circuit, have the tension nullified at the desired level and regulated automatically. The excitative will be of the alternator type with as many phases as the main alternator, and can be synchronous or asynchronous, Both motors can be constructed on one sole axle or shaft thusly constituting a double motor with only two bearings and simplifyir. the construction of the asynchronous alternator. With the variant of being synchronous and with inductor coils fed by direct current, the control unit has a wave rectifier which is the only additional option of same to the control unit in order to excite directly, as other rectifications effected on said units are utilized to feed same, converting theraselves afterwards into alternances of the above entioned reactive current. The excita tion of the asynchronous motor is exclusively alternating. All thnt explained and Aetailed up to this point is mentioned for one sole velocity and is applicable to all and each one of them, having on one same stator grooves sufficiently ample in order to accommodate other velocities just like the electric motors which employ the roost usual systems of windings knobs on the internationel market. However, there is the difference that each of them, in the main motor as well as in the excitative, and all are parallelly and oermanently connected between themselves, and also that same is true as long as one velocity does not produce alterations in a winding of mother velocity.Far example, a speed of 1,500 R.P.M. does not alter at all another of 3,000 and another of 750 because the three velocities cited have a polar opposition so that when one of them is functioning, no tension is produced in the others. Switches must be added for all those velocities that can alter the operation of the electric energy production system dealt with here, being disconnected when one of the others is functioning.The unit or units of excitation and control are co tautated by means of a system 9 figure 12 at the speed which enters into action, all those elements of excessive character are disconnected, for example condensers since it is knawn that one velocity inferior to another in revolutions per minute R.S.I.. is also inferior in potential K.v.A. that is perfectly propor tional to the force in kilowatts K.W. the primary motor has, whatever its nature is. . hen the electric energy production system advocated herewith is applied in charging storage batteries, one of the previously cited schemes is used, the most adequate one for each case with the only difference being the addition of 2 wave rectifier far the obtaining of direct current. All the schemes are symbolicly unifiliar with the objective being to simplify this report, although they are indistinctly singlephase, two phase, or three phase using as many elements or connections as necessary for their assembly. Given that the functional philosophy of the alternator is fundamented on the residual magnetism of the rotor, if said magnetism is lost, its polarization can be effected in two ays. With the motor fully stopped and with the collaboration of a direct current source, or with the motor in operation and in collaboration with an alternating current similar to that of the synchronism, that is with the closest possibly frequency. The form, dimensions and materials can be variable as well as in general anything secondary or any accessory, as long as it does not alter, change or modify the essence of the object described The terms in which this report is written are true and a faith ful reflexion of the object described, and must be taken in a broad sense and never in a limitotive way. The anslic2nt reserves the right to obtaining the opportune additional complementary certificates for improvements or per sectioning that practical use might deem advisable in the future.
