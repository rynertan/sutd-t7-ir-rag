# Oxygen sensor.

## Abstract
An oxygen sensor is disclosed in which an airtight refer ence chamber 32 isolated from a surrounding space is for med on one main surface of a solid electrolyte 10 , a cur rent is supplied to the solid electrolyte to pump out oxygen from the reference chamber in such a manner that oxygen in the reference chamber is ionized and then passes through the solid electrolyte, means is provided for trans ferring oxygen from the surrounding space to the reference chamber in such a manner that oxygen in the surrounding space is ionized and then passes through the solid electro lyte, and the oxygen concentration in the surrounding space is detected on the basis of the current supplied to the solid electrolyte.
