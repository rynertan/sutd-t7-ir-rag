# Method and apparatus for the production of vitreous enamelled substrates.

## Abstract
A method of producing a vitreous enamelled, printed article 42 is characterised by printing 19 a pattern onto a tape 17 , band cast from a homogeneous and air free liquid mixture 13 containing a vitreous constituent and a binder, laminating 24 the printed tape to a base and then firing 41 to bond the tape to the base. The invention has particular application to the production of electrical printed circuits comprising a plurality of printed vitreous layers carried on a metal base. The tape provides a flat surface on which to print a circuit pattern, unlike the uppermost surface of a laminated printed circuit precursor or substrate. Printing on a flatter surface reduces the likelihood of flaws and discontinuities appearing in the circuit pattern in the printing thereof.
