# The selective hydrocarboxylation of propylene to isobutyric acid.

## Abstract
A process for the selective hydrocarboxylation of prop ylene to produce predominantly isobutyric acid in the liquid phase is provided. The reaction of propylene, carbon monox ide and water is effected at a temperature of 75 C to 150 C and at a pressure of 17.5kg cm² 250 psi to 350 kg cm² 5000 psi in the presence of a carboxylic acid solvent and a catalyst comprising a soluble palladium salt, an organo arsine and a hydrogen halide. A water to propylene ratio of less than or equal to 1 is maintained in the reaction.
