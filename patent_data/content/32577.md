# Lubricated cam drum.

## Abstract
The invention deals with problems arising in lubrication of the helical cam grooves of cam drums used in thread traversing mechanisms of winding machines. The drum 10 is provided with an internal space 18 acting as a lubricant reservoir. A passage 26 extends between the space 18 and the groove 16 so that centrifugal force urges lubricant outwardly along the passage 26 from the space 18 towards the groove 16 . Flow along the pass age 26 is controlled by a porous sintered metal body 32 which permits a desired degree of a given lubricant to pass along the passage 26 at a given rotational speed.
