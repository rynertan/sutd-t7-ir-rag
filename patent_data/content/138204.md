## Description
FLAME RETARDANT MIXTURE FOR POLYURETHANE MATERIALSBackground of the Invention Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a mixture of organophosphorus flame retardants for use in polyurethane materials. Description of the Prior Art Dialkylalkanolaminoalkylphosphonate flame retardants, such as described in U. S. Patent No. 3,235,517 to T. M. Beck et al., are a known class of flame retardants. One representative compound of this class i.e., diethyl N,N bis 2 hydroxyethyl aminomethylphosphonate is commercially available under the trademarkFYROL 6 from Stauffer Chemical Company. Compounds of this type have been suggested as useful in rendering polyurethane products flame retardant. However, use of such a flame retardant can lead to embrittlement of the product if used in amounts designed to give a relatively high phosphorus content. Another class of known flame retardant, which carry a higher phosphorus content, is the poly oxyorganophosphate phosphonate flame retardants of the type described in U. S. Patent Nos. 4,199,534 4,268,633 and 4,335,178 to R. B. Fearing. Flame retardants of this type are marketed by Stauffer Chemical Company under the trademark FYROL 51. Use of this latter class of flame retardant has resulted in an unacceptable lowering of the heat distortion temperature of polymeric materials containing urethane when used to give a relatively higher phosphorus content than the type of flame retardant shown in the Beck et al. patent.Summary of the Present Invention Mixtures of the aforementioned dialkylalkanolaminoalkylphosphonate and poly oxyorganophosphate phosphonate flame retardants, when added to polymeric materials containing urethane linkages, has unexpectly been found to produce an acceptable flame retardant composition without a substantial loss in heat distortion temperature.Detailed Description of the Present Invention The terminology dialkylalkanolaminoalkylphosphonate , as used herein, is meant to encompass the type of flame retardants shown in U. S. Patent No. 3,235,517 toT. M. Beck et al. Such compounds can be represented by the general formulaEMI2.1 where R and R1 can independently be alkyl e.g., C1 C and or haloalkyl e.g., C1 Cn chloroalkyl radicals, R2 and R3 can be the same or different lower alkylene radicals e.g., C1 C4 , and R4 is a lower alkylene radical. They are made by reaction of a dialkylanol amine, an aldehyde or ketone, and a dialkyl phosphite as described in the Beck et al. patent. The terminology poly organophosphate phosphonate as used herein is intended to encompass the type of flame retardants shown in U. S. Patent Nos. 4,199,534 4,268,633 and 4,335,178. Such compounds can be represented by the average formulaEMI3.1 wherein m is an integer from 1 to 50 R, R1 and R2 are individually selected from saturated hydrocarbon radicals alkaryl radicals, aralkyl radicals, and aryl radicals andR3 is EMI3.2 wherein R4, R5, R6 and R7 are individually selected from hydrogen atom, hydrocarbon radical5, and halogenated hydrocarbon radicals. Such compounds can be formed by reaction of a diorgano organophosphonate with a phosphorus oxide, followed by reaction of the reaction product with an epoxide, either alone or in admixture with an alcohol. Mixtures of the above two organophosphorus flame retardants e.g., at weight ratios of from about 30 70 to about 70 30 are useful as flame retardants in polymers containing urethane linkages. Examples of such polymers include rigid polymers containing urethane linkages. Included are the polyether and polyester polyurethane materials either foamed or unfoamed that are known to persons of ordinary skill in the art. One representative class of such polymers are the poly oxazolidone urethane compositions described in U. S. PatentNo. 4,386,191 to A. L. DiSalvo petal. Such compositions contain oxazolidone linkages in their polymer backbone separated by ester linkages e.g., derived from an acid anhydride moiety and have urethane side chains attached to the polymer backbone. They are formed by reacting a polyisocyanate with a prepolymer containing epoxy and hydroxy groups.The prepolymer is formed by reacting a polyol, acid anhydride and diepoxide, preferably in a single step reaction. The amount of flame retardant mixture in the selected urethane containing polymer is an effective amount to confer the desired degree of flame retardance on the polymer and can range from about 5 to about 15 by weight the polyurethane. The present invention is illustrated by theExamples which follow. Each of U. S. Patent Nos.3,235,517, 4,199,534, 4,268,633 and 4,335,178, mentioned hereinbefore, is incorporated by reference as showing the type of flame retardants also described before.U. S. Patent No. 4,386,191 is incorporated herein by reference as describing the poly oxazolidone urethane material described earlier. EXAMPLE 1 This Example illustrates the process used to make the poly oxazolidone urethane composition which was tested in Example 2. A mixture of 148 grams 1.Q equivalent weight of phthalic anhydride, 305 grams 1.02 hydroxy equivalent weights of polyethylene glycol ave. mol. wt.600 , 385 grams 1.01 epoxy equivalent weights of the diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A EPON 828 brand fromShell Chemical Co. , and 3.3 grams of methyltrialkyl C8 C1Q ammonium chloride catalyst ADOGEN 464 brand from Sherex Chemical Company, Inc. was heated at 1220C. 1300C. After 40 minutes of heating, the resulting product was found to be free of acidic material, and it had an epoxide equivalent of 927. The prepolymer was blended with ethylene glycol chain extender at a prepolymer chain extender ratio of 76 24. To 100 parts by weight of the blend was then added about 0.1 part by weight of dibutyl tin dilaurate to act as a catalyst. This reactive mixture is referred to hereinafter as Component B and was used to react with various diisocyanates to form poly oxazolidone urethane thermosets. A thermoset plaque prepared by reacting 101 grams of Component B with 145 grams of 4,4 diphenylmethane diisocyanate ISONATE 143L brand from Upjohn ChemicalCompany was subjected to the UL 94 vertical burn test.It showed little flame retardancy and was totally burned.This plaque serves as a control for the results reported in Example 2 i.e. Run A . EXAMPLE 2 A series of thermoset plaques were prepared using the reactive component B described in Example 1. and ISONATE 143L diisocyanate as Component A. In these plaques, various flame retardants were added to impart flame retardant properties. The resulting plaques were subjected to the UL 94 burn test and to a heat distortion temperature HDT determination. The composition of these plaques and the properties are summarized below Comp.

EXAMPLE 3 A series of reaction injection molding RIM experiments were conducted using the formulated mixture as Component B and 4,4 diphenyl methane diisocyanate Upjohn Chemicals ISONATE 191 as Component A. A small amount of trichlorofluoromethane ISOTRON 11 SBA from Pennwalt Corporation was added to Component B to act as a blowing agent. Foamed plaques were prepared by a RIM process, and the plaques were subjected to the UL 94 vertical burn test.

FYROL 51 brand flame retardant appears to be effective in improving the flame retardancy properties of the RIM molded plaques when used in conjunction withFYROL 6 flame retardant. EXAMPLE 4 Several formulated Components B similar to those described in Example 3 were reacted with various commercially available diisocyanates in a reaction injection molding RIM process to form test specimens with a density in the range of 0.6 to 0.9 gm cc. These test specimens were then subjected to the UL 94 vertical burn test. The compositions of specimens and the test results are as follows Companent B parts by weight Wt.
