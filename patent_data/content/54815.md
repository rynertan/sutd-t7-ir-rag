## Description
METHOD OF JOINING AN OBJECT TO AN ARTICLE We have been working in the area of joining radiator structures made from metal to plastic headers. The plastic headers are used at both ends of the radiator structure for initially conveying coolant fluid to the radiator structure and thereafter carrying the coolant fluid away from the radiator structure. Radiators are, of course, well known devices for cooling the coolant fluid used for cooling internal combustion engines. Any joint formed between the radiator structure and the plastic headers associated therewith must be relatively rigid, must remain rigid for prolonged periods of use, for example, in a motor vehicle, and must be relatively easy to form in high speed manufacturing operations. The joint so formed must also be leak free so that no coolant is lost as it passes through the headers and associated radiator structure. It is a principal object of this invention to provide a method of joining an object, such as a header, to an article, such as radiator structure, in a manner which is simple and efficient in operation, but which provides a joined structure in which the joint has a high degree of rigidity as initially formed, the high degree of rigidity being retained over a long service life of the joined structure. This invention relates to a method of joining an object to an article and more particularly to a method of joining an object to an article in which the joint therebetween has a high degree of rigidity. In accordance with the teachings of the method of this invention, a force accepting shoulder is formed on the object. The force accepting shoulder is formed so as to have both a first surface for engaging a surface formed on the article and a second surface spaced away from the first surface thereof. A force applying structure is formed on the article. The force applying structure is formed so as to have both a first surface for engaging the first surface of the force accepting shoulder of. the object and a plurality of deformable tabs extending away from the first surface of the article. The deformable tabs are longer in dimension from the first surface of the article to a free end of each of the tabs than the dimension between the first and the second surfaces of the Object. The first surface of the object is brought in contact with the first surface of the article. In this manner, the second surface of the object is spaced away from the contacting first surfaces of the object and the article. In this condition, at least an upper portion of the deformable tabs of the article are located in proximity to the second surface of the object. Small areas of at least some of the plurality of tabs of the article are deformed out of the plane of the tabs. The deformation is in a direction away from the second surface of the object in proximity to which the tabs are located. This deforming step, of course, may take place during the manufacture of the article, well prior to the time.at which the first surfaces of the object and the article are brought in contact with one another. In order to complete the method of this invention, the upper portion of the deformable tabs of the article are bent intro engagement with the second surface of the object. In this manner, the first and second surfaces of the object are caught between the first surface and the deformed tabs of the article. Also, the article and the object are joined together with the joining thereof by the tabs having small deformed areas therein providing an added degree of rigidity to the joined article and the object. In accordance with preferred teachings of the method of this invention, the deformable tabs are up standing tabs which extend upwardly from the first surface of the article. When the article and the object are assembled with the first surfaces thereof in contact with one another, the upstanding tabs extend upwardly over the second surface of the object. In accordance with still further detailed teachings of the method of this invention, the deformation of the individual tabs can take the form of many different configurations, for example, X or Y . However, the preferable form of the deformation is in the form of one or more linear deformations running from the base portion of the tab toward the free end thereof. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The novel features that are considered characteristics of the invention are set forth with particularity in the appended claims. The invention itself, however, both as to its organization and its method of operation, together with additional objects and advantages thereof, will best be understood from the following description of specific embodiments when read in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein like reference characters indicate like parts throughout the several figures, and in which Figure 1 is a partial elevation view of a radiator structure having a header attached thereto in accordance with the method of this invention Figure 2 is a perspective view of the structure ofFigure 1 prior to the joining operation which is the subject of the method of this invention and Figure 3 is a cross section view taken along lineIII III of Figure 2 showing an upstanding tab formed in accordance with the teachings of the method of this invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EBODIMENT In accordance with the preferred embodiment of this invention, a radiator structure will be assembled with a header therefor in a manner such that a high degree of rigidity is achieved in the joined structure. The method, however, may also be applied to join other articles and objects together as desired by the person performing the method. A radiator structure, generally identified by the numeral 10, is joined to a header, generally identified by the numberal 12, as is described in detail hereinbelow.When the header 12 is formed, there is formed thereon a force accepting shoulder 14, best seen in Figure 2. This force accepting shoulder has both a first surface 16 for engaging a surface formed on the radiator structure 10, and a second surface 18 spaced, in the preferred embodiment, a uniform distance from the first surface 16. The header 12 is formed in a plastic molding operation by molding a suitable plastic material. The force accepting shoulder 14, as well as the first and second surfaces thereof, respectively designated 16 and 18, are formed simultaneously in a single operation. As also stated above, the distance separating the first surface and the second surface is uniform about the entire perimeter of the force accepting shoulder. It is, of course, obvious that the header may be formed of other materials, for example metal. In such a case, the force accepting shoulder and associated surfaces thereof would be formed in a metal bending operation. The space between the first surface 16 and the second surface 18 of the force accepting shoulder 14 of the header 12 need not be uniform about the entire perimeter of the header. If there is a variation in this dimension, associated tabs formed on the radiator structure 10 can be made of different lengths to accommodate the variability and the distance between the first and second surfaces.This will become more apparent upon further reading of this specification. Once again, it is preferred to have the distance between the first surface 16 and the second surface 18 of the force accepting shoulder uniform, as this alleviates many problems and makes for a better joining of the two structures. In accordance with the further teachings of the method of this invention, the radiator structure 10 has a force applying structure 20 associated therewith. This force applying structure is formed so as to have a first surface 22, see Figure ill for engaging the first surface 16 of the force accepting shoulder 14 of the header 12. The force applying structure 20 of the radiator structure 10 also has a plurality of deformable tabs 24 extending away from the first surface 22 thereof. In accordance with the method of this invention, the deformable tabs 24 have a length dimension from the first surface 22 of the radiator structure 10 to a free end of each of the tabs 24 which is greater in dimension than the dimension between the first surface 16 and the second surface 18 of the force accepting shoulder 14 of the header 12. As stated above, the dimension between the first surface 16 and the second surface 18 of the force accepting shoulder 14 need not be uniform, but if it is not, the lengths of individual ones of the tabs 24 are adjusted so that the tab length exceeds the dimension between the two surfaces that are associated with an individual tab. In accordance with the preferred embodiment, the radiator structure 10 is made from metal and the force applying structure is formed from metal. Normally, metal is used because the tabs are then deformable to a different position. It would also be within the scope of the method to anchor a metallic force applying structure 20 in a plastic block which form the remainder of the article. Some of the plurality of individual tabs 24 have small areas 26 26 thereon which are deformed outwardly from the plane of the tabs in a direction generally away from the radiator structure 10. In the preferred embodiment, the deformed small areas 26 26 are linear and generally run from a location near the first surface 22 of the force applying structure 20 to the free ends of the individual tabs. Some tabs have a plurality of small deformed areas 26 26, while others have only a single deformed area 26, and other tabs have no deformed areas. The reasons that different areas are deformed in different manners is that in this particular joining of a radiator structure 10 to a header 12, the greatest degree of rigidity required in the joining is at the central portions of the structure, whereas at the ends thereof there is little need for added rigidity.Other configurations of deformations may be made in the individual tabs, for example, Y or Z . We, however, prefer the linear deformations shown in the drawings, as these are the simplest to perform. It is also readily apparent that the deformations forming the snall areas 26 26 on the individual tabs 24 24 are placed in this element when the force applying structure 20 is being manufactured. In accordance with the further steps of the method of this invention, the first surface 16 of the force accepting shoulder 14 of the header 12 is brought into contact with the first surface 22 of the force applying structure 20 of the radiator structure 10. In this manner, the second surface 18 of the radiator structure is spaced away from the contacting first surfaces 16 and 22 of the header 12 and radiator structure 10. As stated earlier in this specification, in accordance with the preferred embodiment the spacing of the second surface from the first surface is uniform. When the surfaces are so engaged, at least an upper portion of the deformable tabs 24 24 are located in proximity to the second surface 18 of the header 12. In the preferred embodiment, these tabs 24 24 are generally adjacent the force accepting shoulder 14 of the header 12.However, it may be that the tabs would be inclined at some angular attitude for a particular reason.Therefore, in the claims under consideration herein, when we claim that the tabs are located in proximity to said second surface of the object , we mean that they can have any angular attitude with respect to the force accepting shoulder 14 formed on the header 12. Preferably, that angular attitude is one in which they are in parallel with the surface between the first surface 16 and the second surface 18 of the force accepting shoulder 14. In accordance with the last step of the method of this invention, the upper portion of the deformable tabs 24 24 are bent into engagement with the second surface 18 of the header 12. In this manner, the first and second surfaces, respectively 16 and 18 of the force accepting shoulding 14 of the header 12, are caught between the first surface 22 and the deformed tabs 24 24 of the radiator structure 10. In this manner, the radiator structure 10 and the header 12 are joined with the individual tabs 24 24 of the radiator structure having the small deformed areas 26 26 therein providing an added degree of rigidity to the joining of the radiator structure and header. As stated above, the central portion of the joined structure is the portion of the structure which requires the greatest degree of rigidity in the structure disclosed in the preferred method. In other structures, the rigidity may be required at different locations along the joined portions of the article and the object. While particular embodiments of the method of this invention have been illustrated and described, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the invention, and it is intended to cover in the appended claims all such modifications and equivalents as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.
