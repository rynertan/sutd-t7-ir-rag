# Sensitized photoconductive compositions and elements.

## Abstract
Photoconductive compositions comprising photoconduc tors and 1, 4, 5, 8 naphthalene bis dicarboximide sensitizing compounds are disclosed. Compositions and elements contain ing such compounds are sensitized exclusively to radiation below 400nm. Embodiments are disclosed in which the photoconductor is an arylalkane leuco base. Such embodiments are also nonper sistently conductive.
