## Description
Device for collecting crude oil from marine surfacesThis invention concerns a floating device, preferably made of sheet steel, for collecting and recovering mainly crude oil spread over marine suffaces.The severe problem is well known of water pollution due to the discharge and washing of the tanks of oil tanders, which leaves large slicks of oil on marine surfaces, with consequent alteration of the life of animal and plant organisms as well as fouling of the coasts due to current effects.Under this aspect, the situation of ports and areas along the major routes is particularly serious.The aim of this invention is to realize a simple device, low in cost, readily built using known technology, whihh can collect and eventually recover the crude oil spread on the sufface. This aim is achieved with the device according to the invention, comprising a container for collecting the oil, supported by several major external floats, surrounded by fins which open and broaden to the front, and which can colleet the crude oil and pass it into said container for skimming, during the movement caused by a ship with the device applied in front of its bow Sea level is kept at the upper edge of said container an intermediate thrust boat carrving the pump for pirating the floating oil in the upper portion of said container and that for extracting the water on the bottom of it an inlet tube for compressed air in said external floats an automatic level stabilizing valve and an air inlet outlet valve electrical cables and an automatic switch for the water pump motor.The invention is presented in a preferred but purely exemplifying and non limiting embodiment in the attached drawings, which show figure 3, a side schematization figure 2, a top view figure 3, a side view of the device aPplied to a thrust boat being put into operation frgure 4, a partially sectioned side view of the automatic level stabilizing valve, with sections A B and C D. The figures show in detail the container 1 for collecting the oil the cover 2 reinforced with radial V shaped sections the pretroleum collecting fins 3 in figure 1 the fins are represented with dashed and dotted lines the principle external floats 1 the intermediate thrust and pump bearing boat 5 the structure 6 connecting the two boats, designed to allow independent float the draft vessel 7 of the petroleum aspirating tube the aspirating tube 8, preferably made of steel the juncture 9 the flexible tube 10 attached to the petroleum pump the steal water aspirating tube Ii the juncture 12 the flexible tube 13 attached to the water pump the inlet tube 14 for putting compressed air in the floats 4 the automatic lovel stabilizing valve 15 the air inlet and or outlet valve 36 the opening 17 for letting air out of the floats 4 the internal float 18 of the automatic valve 15 the automatic electric switch 19 of the water pump motor the electric cable 20 from the tanker N the inner float 21 between water and petroleum the water inlet valve 22 the opening 23 for inlet and or outlet of water according to the level L the attaching rings 24 for raising and placing the device the wheel 25 for operating valve 22 the structures 5 supporting pin P for a hinged connection between the device and the bow of boat N.The collectingc boat device may be placed in the sea for operation by a rotating arm crane on the bow of the tanker.Upon immersion, valve 22 opens and valve 16 closes Water then enters the collection container 1 through open valve 22 and the external floats 4 through the opening 23 until the air in the floats reaches a pressure of approximately 1 3 atmosphere.At this point the water in container ss will have reached the upper level, and the inner float 18 will have automatically closed valve 35. The two boats are then connected with connections 6, valve 16 is opened valve 22 is closed and finally the electrical pumps and compressor are placed in operation, the latter regulated at 3 to 5 atmospheres depending on the conditions of the sea.Also, the tanker is put into motion very slowly so that the two boats are pushed forward a few meters per minute, adjusted according to the deliverv of the pumps.The generator and compressor, with compressed air tank, are situated on the tanker.In a possible variant of the invention, the water pump, the valve 22, the electrical switbh 39, the tubes and the other mechanisms described may be eldXrnTnated . n this case, when the pump and valve 22 are elitiCated, the collection container 3 must have an opening on the bottom from which water can go eut and or come in, equipped with an indicator for the difference in level between the petroleum and the sea.ThE V shaped sections reinforcing the cover 2 and fixing it to container 1, bear the aspirating tubes 8 and 11, automatic switch 23, stabilizing valve 15 and wheel 25 for operating valve 22. The cover 2, made of steEl sheet, forms peripherally with the container 1 a circular opening a few centimeters wide, through which the petroleum enters.When the sea is fairly rough, waves carrving water as weil may come into the container however, they break on the cover without disturbing the oil on the surface going into the draft vessel 7.The cover with the conical surface makes the wave enter the peripheral opening, so that the water can deposit on the bottom of the container.Of course, while the principle of the finding remains the same, the realization forms and constructaon details may be varied widely from that described and illustrated here, without going beyond the bounds of the present invention.
