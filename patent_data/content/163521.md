# Fixed ophthalmic lens polishing pad.

## Abstract
A pad for polishing optical quality surfaces, such as lenses, comprises a flexible support 23, 23 and a flexible layer 21, 21 of polishing material secured to the support, the polishing material layer comprising a matrix of a latex material and a water soluble polymer, the matrix containing polishing particles such as cerium oxide or the like. The pad is such that, in use with water, the polishing particles are gradually released by slow dissolution of the polymer. One form of polishing layer is produced by mixing a water soluble polyalkylene oxide phenolic complex with an acrylic latex and an alcoholic slurry of polishing particles.
