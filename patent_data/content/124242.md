# POSITION TRANSDUCER

## Abstract
A servovalve has a sensor for sensing the movement and indicating the position of the valve spool 1 . The sensor com prises a ferrite core 5 mounted upon an extension 4 of the spool 1 , and a pick up coil 6 connected into the circuit of a Colpitts oscillator whose output drives, via a voltage limiter, a phase lock loop integrated circuit IC2 . The output of the circuit IC2 is connected to a phase comparator IC3 to produce a control signal whose amplitude represents the frequency of oscillation of the oscillator.
