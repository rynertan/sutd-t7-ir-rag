# Liquid level indicator.

## Abstract
A liquid level gauge including an elongate support member 11 , and, a plurality of optical fibres 16 carried by the support member 11 , said fibres 16 extending on the support member 11 generally lengthwise thereof and generally parallel to each other, said fibres 16 being spaced apart from each other circumferentially of the support member 11 and each fibre 16 being divided at a point along the length of the support member 11 by a gap 26 so arranged that the transmission of the light across the gap 26 from one part of a fibre 16 to the other part thereof is determined by the presence or absence in the gap 26 of the liquid being gauged, the gaps 26 of the fibres 16 being spaced lengthwise of the support member 11 .
