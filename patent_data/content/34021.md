## Description
Method of casting single crystal metal or metal alloy article The present invention is concerned with a method of casting single crystal metal or metal alloy articles. When molten metal solidifies against a relatively cold surface, small crystals form. As the metal continues to solidify, the initially formed crystals grow in a direction parallel to the direction of heat flow. The first formed crystals are often elongated and are commonly referred to as columnar. In subsequent stages of solidification, when the heat flow becomes less directional, many nonelongated crystals or grains tend to form in the remaining metal. Articles produced by casting without controlling the progress of solidification in one major direction but instead allowing freezing to take place from all mould surfaces are known as equiaxed castings. In equiaxed castings, there are many crystals of a generally random orientation and little, if any, elongation of the crystals. It has been well recognized in the art that, for certain high temperature applications, generally improved performance characteristics can be obtained by directional solidification techniques which control the shape, orientation and number of crystals. In directional solidification, a mould having a cavity which is open at the bottom is placed on a water cooled copper chill plate the mould is heated to such a high temperature that most of the mould, except for the portion adjacent to the chill plate, is above the melting point of the metal to be cast. When a high temperature alloy is cast in such a mould, heat is extracted by the chill plate and many columnar crystals form perpendicular to the surface of the chill plate.It is a common practice to lower the chill plate from a hot zone in a furnace in a gradual manner so that the numerous columnar grains formed at the chill plate surface extend through the entire mould cavity. An apparatus for forming castings having columnar grains by this process is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,680,625. Greater improvements in high temperature properties can be achieved if an entire cast article is composed of a single crystal such a casting may be obtained by selecting one of many columnar crystals or grains formed at a chill surface and allowing it to enter a mould cavity having a configuration corresponding to the configuration of the desired cast article. The particular crystal is selected using a crystal selector cavity with a geometrical shape such that one crystal is selected preferentially examples of such selector cavities are shown in U.S. Patents 3,494,709 3,542,120 3,724,531 and 4,111,252. For a crystal selector cavity to operate successfully, it is important that the formation of crystals is not initiated in the selector cavity.The initiation or nucleation of crystals in a selector cavity might occur when the inner surface of the cavity is cooled to a temperature below the melting point of the metal being cast, which could result in the growth of two or more crystals from the crystal selector cavity into a mould cavity. Another detrimental result of initiation of the formation of crystals in the selector cavity is that the crystals will not have the desired crystallographic orientation, because the crystals which initiate in the selector cavity will probably have an orientation which is not the same as those initiated at the chill plate. This can result in a single crystal casting in which the crystallographic orientation of the casting is unacceptable. The present invention provides an improved method of casting single crystal metal or metal alloy articles having a desired crystallographic orientation.In forming the single crystal article1 a mould having communicating starter, selector, and article forming cavities is provided. The mould is heated above the liquidus temperature of the metal or alloy and the molten metal or alloy is flowed into the starter, selector and mould cavities. The formation of a plurality of metal crystals is initiated in the starter cavity while inhibiting initiation of crystals in the selector cavity and crystal growth is allowed in a preferential direction such that a single crystal of metal or alloy is grown from the selector cavity into the article forming cavity. The initiation of crystals in the starter cavity while inhibiting initiation of crystals in the selector cavity is accomplished according to the invention by retarding heat flow from the selector cavity in a direction transverse to the path of crystal growth and promoting heat flow from the selector cavity along the path of crystal growth. This is accomplished by the provision of thermal insulation material which is disposed at least partially around the portion of the mould in which the selector cavity is located. The promotion of the heat flow from the selector cavity in the preferential direction of crystal growth is also promoted by the insulation material and also, preferably, by exposing the metal or alloy in the starter cavity to a chill plate or surface. In the following description, reference will be made to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic illustration of the way in which a mould supported on a chill plate is preheated in a furnace prior to pouring of molten metal into the mould in one embodiment of the method according to the invention and Figure 2 is an enlarged fragmentary view of a portion of the mould shown in Figure 1 and illustrating the relationship between the starter cavity, the selector cavity and the mould cavity. Referring to Figure 1, a mould 10 is disposed in a furnace assembly 12 in which the mould is preheated prior to the pouring of metal into the mould.The furnace assembly 12 is provided with a refractory outer wall 16 which is surrounded by an induction heating coil 18. A graphite susceptor wall 20 is enclosed by the outer wall 16 and is heated by the effect of a magnetic field from the coil 18. The furnace assembly 12 has a top plate 2Z with an opening 24 through which molten metal can be poured into the mould 10. It is contemplated that the entire furnace assembly 12 will be disposed within a vacuum furnace in use. The mould 10 has a pouring basin 32 through which molten metal enters radially extending passages leading to mould sections 38 or ceramic mould material.A circular heat shield 36 is advantageously provided between a ceramic filled downpole 34 and the mould sections 38 which are disposed in a circular array about the downpole 34. The mould sections 38 are in fluid communication with the pouring basin 32 so that molten metal can flow from the basin into the various mould sections. The mould 10 is disposed on a chill plate 42, which contains passages through which cold fluid can be circulated so as to cool the chill plate 42 and thereby promote the flow of heat downwardly from the mould sections 38 to the chill plate 42. Each of the identical mould sections 38 includes a cylindrical starter cavity 48 see Figure 2 , a generally helical crystal selector cavity 50 and an article forming cavity 52. The starter cavity 48 has a horizontal circular upper surface 56 which faces downwardly toward a horizontal upper surface 58 of the chill plate 42. The selector cavity 50 has a lower circular opening 62 which is disposed at the centre of the upper surface 56 such that, in use, columnar metal crystals from the starter cavity 48 enter the selector cavity 50 through the opening 62. The selector cavity 50 has an upper circular opening 64 through which a single crystal of metal enters the article forming cavity 52 in use. The articleforming cavity 52 has a configuration which corresponds to the desired configuration of an article which is to be cast as a single crystal of metal. The starter, selector and article forming cavities 48, 50 and 52 are all in fluid communication with one another and are defined by a wall of a suitable ceramic mould material. Although the starter, selector and article forming cavities 48, 50 and 52 may be formed in many different ways, they are generally formed in a lost wax or shell investment process by covering a wax pattern with a slurry of ceramic mould material, for example, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,111,252. In carrying out the method according to the present invention, a layer of insulation material 70 is provided to extend completely around the portion of the mould section 38 containing the selector cavity 50 as illustrated, the layer of insulation material 70 also extends completely around the starter cavity 48. The layer of insulation material 70 inhibits nucleation or initiation of crystals in the selector cavity 50 to thereby enable a single crystal article having the desired crystallographic orientation to be produced in the article forming cavity 52. In use, the entire mould 10 is heated in the furnace assembly 12 to a temperature which is above the melting temperature of the metal which is to be cast.Molten metal is then poured through the opening 24 into the pouring basin 32. The molten metal flows from the basin 32 outwardly through radially extending passages to the various mould sections 38 and fills the starter, selector and mould cavities 48, 50 and 52 in each of the mould sections 38. When the molten metal reaches the upper surface 58 of the chill plate 42, the metal solidifies to form many columnar crystals having longitudinal central axes which extend perpendicular to the surface 58. As is conventional, the chill plate 42 is gradually lowered from the hot zone of the furnace 12 so that the columnar grains grow upwardly toward the upper surface 56 of the starter cavity 48. As this occurs, the solid liguid interface between the molten and solidified metal moves upwardly and remains generally parallel to the upper surface 58 of the chill plate and the upper surface 56 of the starter cavity 48. Although a plurality of crystals enter the selector cavity 50 through the opening 62, the number of crystals which enter the selector cavity is substantially less than the total number which are formed at the chill plate 42. The crystals which enter the selector cavity 50 continue to grow vertically upwardly in the selector cavity, this vertical growth being promoted by the chill plate 42 drawing heat from the selector cavity 50 downwardly along the path of crystal growth.The vertical growth of metal crystals in the selector cavity 50 is also promoted because the heat flow in the horizontal direction from the selector cavity is retarded by the layer of thermal insulation material 70 which tends to maintain the mould material defining the inside surfaces of the selector cavity 50 at a temperature above the melting temperature of the metal and thereby prevent initiation of crystals in the selector cavity . The selector cavity 50 has a geometric configuration which allows the crystals to solidify only in a sideways direction in a liquid region, so that after the vertically growing crystals reach the upper surface of the helical passage forming the selector cavity 50, further growth in the selector cavity occurs only for crystals that can solidify sideways into the liquid region. Although a substantial number of crystals initially enter the selector cavity 50, competition between the crystals as the solid liquid interface moves vertically upwardly leads to selection of only one crystal. A helical selector cavity is illustrated and described herein, but other geometric configurations can be used, if desired. The selected crystal enters the articleforming cavity 52 through the opening 64 and then continues to solidify upwardly to form a single crystal article having a desired configuration. Although full details of the crystal growth mechanism are not fully understood, it is believed that the layer of insulati on material 70 reduces heat loss from the selector cavity 50 in a direction transverse to the path of crystal growth, thereby promoting upward growth of crystals in a manner which tends to reduce nucleation of spurious crystals in the selector cavity 50 and thus promoting the entrance of a single crystal into the article forming cavity 52. Since this single crystal is the result of crystals which were initially formed at the upper surface 58 of the chill plate 42, the single crystal which enters the article forming cavity 52, and thus the resulting article formed in cavity 52, will have a crystallographic orientation which can be predicted with a reasonable degree of certainty. It is preferred that the insulation material should extend not only around the crystal selector cavity 50, but also around the starter cavity 48. Under certain circumstances it may be desirable to have the layer of insulation material formed in one or more sections with and or without one or more spaces through which ceramic mould material is exposed. The mould 10 may be of a conventional composition which comprises a complex aggregate of particulate ceramic held together by a binder a particularly suitable mould material is described inU.S. Patent 4,066,116. The thermal conductivities of two exemplary known mould materials were approximately 11 and 16 BTU inch per hr. ft.ê F in air at 1832 F 10000C , while their densities at room temperature were from 154 to 164 pounds per cubic foot for the former mould material and 182 to 190 pounds per cubic foot for the latter mould material. Other commonly used ceramic mould materials have a thermal conductivity of 8 to 19 BTU in. per hr. ft. OF at approximately 18000F 9820C . Just as the mould 10 can be formed of various ceramic materials, various insulation materials 70 can be used. A ceramic aluminosilicate fibrous insulating material sold under the trademark Kaowool having a density in a range of from 4 12 pounds per cubic foot 64.1 to 192.3 kg. m3 , preferably a density of about eight pounds per cubic foot 128.3 kg.m and a thermal conductivity of between 1.2 and 2.25 at 18000F 98200 is one example of a suitable material other examples of suitable ceramic aluminosilicate fibrous insulating materials are sold under the trademarksFiberfrax and Fiberchrome. The material sold under the trademark Fiberfrax is available in blankets and felts having a density in the range of 4 8 pounds per cubic foot 64.1 to 128.3 kg.m 3 and a thermal conductivity which ranges from 1.6 to 2.7 at 18000F 98200 it is also available in a coatable form having a density of from 30 to 50 pounds per cubic foot 480.8 to 801.4 kg.m 3 and a thermal conductivity at 18000F 98200 of 1.55 to 1.73 the material sold as Fiberchrome is available in densities of from 3 to 24 pounds per cubic foot 48.1 to 384.7 kg.m 1.73 and has a thermal conductivity which varies from 1 to 3.2 at 18000F 98200 . The abovementioned insulation materials are aluminosilicates, but other ceramic insulating material could be used if desired. For example, an yttria stabilised zirconium oxide felt which is sold under the trademark of Zircar having a density of from 15 to 20 pounds per cubic foot 240.4 to 320.6 kg.m 3 and a thermal conductivity of about 1.3 at 18000F 982 C and felt produced from carbon graphite fibres such as a felt having a density of about 5.3 pounds per cubic foot 85 kg.m 3 and a thermal conductivity of about 1.8 at 20000F 10q30C in an inert gas environment, which is used to prevent the felt from burning are also suitable. Accordingly, the thermal conductivity of the insulation material is preferably from 1 to 3.2 BTU in.per hr. ft. F. at 1800 F 982 C . The fibrous insulation material may be applied around the selector cavity 50 and starter cavity 48 by dip ing it in aqueous liquid binder to impart rigidity to the insulation, but other methods may be used if desired. For example, mechanical devices could be used to connect the insulation material to the mould section 38. Experiments were conducted to ascertain the most advantageous thickness for the insulation material 70 in one of these experiments, a mould 10 having twelve sections 38 was utilized. A 7.6 cm 3 inches thick layer of a dry ceramic fibrous insulation material having a density of eight pounds per cubic foot 128.3 kg.m 3 and sold under the trademark Kaowool was loosely piled around the bottom of the mould 10. The same insulation material was used in the subsequently described experiments . The loosely piled layer of insulation material had a depth such that it reached upwardly from an upper surface of a bottom wall 74 see Figure 2 of the mould 10 to the upper end of the selector cavity 50 of each of the mould sections 38, so that the starter cavity 48 and selector cavity 50 of each mould section 38 was surrounded by an insulating layer having a horizontal extent which was at least as great as the horizontal extent of the mould 10. Thermocouples were mounted on the outside of a mould section 38 at a vertical height of 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 inches 1.27 cm, 3.81 cm and 6.35 cm, respectively from the upper surface of the bottom wall 74. The bottom wall 74 of the mould 10 had a thickness of approximately 0.25 inches 0.63 cm so that the thermo couples were located at distances of approximately 0.75i 1.75 and 2.75 inches 1.90 cm, 4.44 cm and 6.98 cm, respectively from the upper surface 58 of the chill plate 42. The upper surface of the insulation material surrounding the mould section 38 was located at a height of three inches 7.6 cm above the upper surface of the mould wall 74 or at a height of 3 25 inches 8.23 cm from the upper surface 58 of the chill plate 42. The mould 10 was then preheated to a peak temperature within the furnace 12 of approximately 27500F 15100C and was held close to this temperature for a period of approximately twenty minutes prior to pouring the molten alloy a nickel base superalloy having a composition within the following range 8.0 to 10.5 chromium, 3 75 to 12.5 tungsten, 0.9 to 2.25 titanium, 4.75 to 5.70 aluminium, and also containing not in excess of 11 cobalt, 1.25 columbium, 12.25 tantalum, 1.6 hafnium, 0,8 molybdenum, 0.17 carbon, 0.02 boron, and 0.08 zirconium the balance of the alloy being essentially nickel . The molten alloy was poured at a temperature of 28000F 15380C ,well above the metal melting point liquidus of about 25000F 13700C . After the molten alloy had been poured, the mould 10 was gradually withdrawn from the hot zone of the furnace assembly 12 at a rate of approximately three inches 7.6 cm per hour while maintaining the peak hot zone temperature at 27500F 15100C . One of the twelve mould sections 38 leaked metal so that only eleven castings of the twelve poured were available for examination the eleven castings were examined conventionally, by acid etching, to reveal the number, shape and alignment of the crystals, showing that all of the castings were unsatisfactory. Eight of the eleven castings were multigrained and the other three had crystallographic orientations which were off axis. It is believed that this high scrap rate resulted from spurious nucleation in the selector cavity 50, possibly as a result of the temperature in the selector cavity being well below the liquidus temperature of the molten alloy. Immediately before pouring of the molten alloy, the thermocouple on the outside of the mould section 38 at a height of 0.5 inches 1.27 cm from the top of the bottom wall 74 indicated a temperature of approximately 5500F 2880C , while the thermocouple which was located 1.5 inches 3.81 cm from the top of the bottom wall 74 indicated a temperature of approximately 9000F 4820C and the thermocouple which was 2.5 inches 6.35 cm above the bottom wall indicated a temperature of 23750F 13010C .It is believed that these relatively low temperatures indicate that the starter cavity 48 and the selector cavity 50 were, immediately prior to pouring of the molten alloy below the liquidus temperature 1370 C , causing initiation of crystals in the selector cavity 50. This may be because the layer of thermal insulation material was too thick. We therefore evaluated other different thicknesses of the insulating layer 70, as follows a mould 10 having eleven mould sections 38 disposed in a circular array was used, two of the mould sections 38 being left free of insulation a layer of insulation material of thickness 1 8 inch 0.32 cm being applied over two mould sections a layer of insulation material 1 4 inch 0.63 cm thick being applied over one mould section 38 a layer of insulation material 1 2 inch 1.27 cm thick being applied over two mould sections 38 and layers of insulation material having thicknesses of 3 4 inch 1.89 cm , one inch 2.54 cm , 1 1 2 inches 3.81 cm and two inches 5.08 cm were applied over four respective mould sections 38. Each layer of insulation material surrounded the starter and selector cavities 48 and 50 in the manner shown in Figure 2. The insulation material was as used in the previous experiment to facilitate adhesion thereof to the mould surfaces, the insulation material was first dipped in an aqueous colloidal silica binder, which when dry, imparts rigidity to the insulating material. Thermocouples were connected to the outside of the mould sections 38 which were free of insulating material, and to the outside of the mould sections in which the 1 4 inch, 1 2 inch, one inch, and two inch thick layers of insulation material were applied. The thermocouples were all located on an upper surface of the horizontally extending shoulder 78 see Figure 2 at the junction between the starter cavity 48 and selector cavity 50, that is, approximately one inch 2.54 cm from the upper surface of the bottom wall 74 of the mould 10 or approximately 1.25 inches 3.17 cm from the upper surface 58 of the chill plate 42. After preheating of the mould 10 to a temperature of approximately 27500F 15100C for twenty minutes, a molten nickel based superalloy metal as used in the previously described experiment was poured into the mould at a temperature of approximately 2800 F 15380C . After pouring, the mould was gradually withdrawn at a rate of three inches 7.6 cm per hour from the hot zone of the furnace with the peak hot zone temperature at approximately 27500F 15100C . The conditions under which the second experiment was performed were substantially the same as the conditions under which the first experiment was performed. During the second experiment, the mould sections 38 having a layer of insulating material 1 2 inch thick and one inch thick ran out so that castings were not obtained from these mould sections. An examination of the castings from the other mould sections 38 yielded the following results Insulation material Casting thickness characteristicsNone Single crystal casting oriented 20 off the desired crystallographic axis.1 8 inches Single crystal casting with satisfactory crystallographic orientation.1 4 inch Single crystal casting having satisfactory crystallographic orientation.3 4 inch Single crystal casting with unacceptable crystallographic orientation.1 1 2 inches Multiple crystal casting unsatisfactory.2 inches Single crystal casting with very unsatisfactory crystallographic orientation. Thermocouple readings were taken to determine the temperature of the outside of the mould sections 38 immediately prior to pouring of the molten alloy, at the start of the withdrawal of the mould from the hot zone of the furnace after pouring of the alloy and 25 minutes after the pouring of the molten alloy.The results of these temperature measurements were as follows Insulation material Start of 25 Minutes thickness Before Pour Withdrawal After PourNone 2495 0F 25100F 2350 F 1 8 inch 1 4 inch 2270 0F 2290 0F 22100F 1 2 inch 2260 21700F 2440 23800F 2290 22000F 3 4 inch 1 inch 6400F 8000F 9400F 1 1 2 inches 2 inches 5800F 7000F 6800F As a result of the second experiment it is believed that the insulating material should have a thickness of between 1 8 inch 0.32 cm and 1 1 2 3.81 cm the actual thickness used depending upon the specific composition of the alloy which is poured and other variables.The selection of a particular thickness of insulation material will, to some extent at least, be influenced by the geographic configuration of the selector cavity 50 and its orientation relative to the starter cavity 48 and the thickness of the ceramic mould material used to form the mould sections 38.However, it is believed that perhaps the most significant variables governing the choice of thickness are the specific composition of the insulation and of the alloy being poured the latter alloy being preferably a nickel based superalloy . A third experiment was performed using a mould 10 having nineteen sections 38 of the same general construction as the mould sections which were used in the previous experiments. Of the 19 sections, one of them had a run out during the casting process so that a casting was not obtained. During the third experiment, layers of insulation material each having a thickness of 1 4 inch 0.63 cm were applied around the selector cavity 50 and starter cavity 48 of twelve of the mould sections 38 in the manner shown in Figure 2 of the drawings the other six mould sections 38 were left free of insulation material. Castings were made using the same alloy and conditions as described above of the twelve castings made with the 1 4 inch thick layer of insulation material, eleven were single crystal castings having the desired crystallographic orientation, while of the six castings which were made without any insulation, only one casting was a single crystal casting with the desired crystallographic orientation.
