# Communication system having dynamically assigned station set buttons.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a communication system and operating method wherein the manner in which all telephone calls are displayed at a station set allows uniform user operations to originate and terminate those calls. This is accomplished by having all calls dynamically assigned to the same set of general call appearances buttons on a multibutton station set . There are no call appearances that are dedicated to specific call types. This allows the station set user to perform the same set of operations on all calls by using the same sequence of physi cal operations independent of the type of call. Additionally, the system may reserve one call appearance button at a station set for special use.
