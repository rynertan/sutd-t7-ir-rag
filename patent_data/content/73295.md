# Method of preparing high quality vinylidene fluoride polymer in aqueous emulsion.

## Abstract
Vinylidene fluoride polymers of high quality are prepared consistently by an emulsion polymerization process in which the monomer, chain transfer agent iso propyl alcohol , and an aqueous emulsion of the initiator di isopropylperoxydicarbonate containing a fluoro surfactant of a limited class are fed incremently to an aqueous reaction medium containing a fluoro surfactant.
