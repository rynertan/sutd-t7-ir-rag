## Description
This invention rela tes to building and like components and to methods of making the same. In British Patent Specification 1,324,681 is described a method of manufacturing a building or like component in polyester resin. Such components have proved satisfactory in applications where strength in a direction transversely of the sluts is required. In other applications, strength in both the transverse and longitudinal directions is required. According to the present invention, a method of making a building or like component of reinforced polyester resin comprises utilising an open topped mould defining the component perimeter and having a base with a generally flat, upper surface interrupted by a plurality of parallel, elongate recesses extending substantially end to end of the mould covering th e recesses with apermeable reinforcing element applying a flowable, filled polyester resin mix to the permeable reinforcing element, pressing a reinforcing bar into each slot such that each slot becomes lined with a generally U shaped portion of first reinforcing element, the reinforcing element being provided in one or more pieces such that it extends uninterruptedly from side to side of the mould transversly of the reinforcing bars applying further flowable, filled polyester resin mix to the permeable reinforcing element and laying second permeable reinforcing material to the further resin mix, and allowing the component to cure before removing the component from the mould. The invention also includes a building or li ke component manufactured by the above defined method. The invention thus provides a component exhibiting satisfactory strength characteristics in both longitudinal and transverse directions, hence providing a component having a wider field of application than the uni directional strength panel described in British Patent Specificgjtion 1,324,681 and its attendant limitations. The edge to edge extension of the first, permeable reinforcing element may be effected in several ways. In theory a single sheet of reinforcing element could be employed, of dimensions exceeding the lateral dimension of the mould by an amount to be pressed into the recesses such that thereafter, the lateral dimension of the reinforcing element is slightly less than the corresponding mould dimension.However, from the practical viewpoint it is simpler to employ pre cut strips of reinforcing element, the strips being of such width that, after being pressed into their respective recesses, strip edges project from the recesses and lie along the flat base, the projection being such that mutually adjacent edges overlap one another. Alternatively, but again employing the strip concept, the projection may not overlap and the resulting gaps may be filled by bridging strips extending along the flat base and overlapping two adjacent strip edges. The resin preferably includes a filler which settles upon standing. Preferably, the mix comprises three partsEMI3.1 to one partEMI3.2 TheEMI3.3 onveniently,consists of silica sand, e.g. 9O mesh B.S.S. The mix, if made in the U.K., would also require additions of accelerator and catalyst, as is well kndwn in the art, to achieve curing in a reasona ble time period. However, such additions may be unnecessary in hotter climates. In detail and for U.K. manuf acture a 3 1 sand resin mix, when employing a proprietary unaccelerated resin may require a styrene monomer in a quantity of4O of the resin b 0.5 cc of 6 cobalt accelerator per pound of mix c a catalyst e.g.BUTA OX M50 in a quantity of 4 cc per pound of mix Although the reinforcing element could be wire mesh, hessian, fabric, sacking, it is preferred that fibre. glass matting is employed which is readily capable of being wetted by the above resinous mixes, e.g. 1 oz ft2 of chopped malting is suitable. The invention will now be described in greater detail, by way of examples, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a perspective view of a mould for making components in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is a section on the line Il Il of Figure 1 showing the first stage of the manufacturing method Figure to 6 correspond to Figure 2 but show succeeding steps of the manufacturing method Figure 7 shows a component manufactured by the method of Figures l to 6, and Figures 8 and 9 illustrate alternative permeable reinforcing element arrangements. In the drawings, a mould 1 for producing rectangular components comprises end walls 2 and side walls 3 defining the perimeter required for the component. The mould has a base 4 with a flat, upper surface 5 interrupted by a plurality of parable, elongate recesses 6, three being illustrated extending into close proximitywith each end wall 2. As iltustrated in Figure 2, a reinforcing element 7 constituted by a plurality of individual strips 8 of fibreglass is laid over each recess 6, and as illustrated in Figure 3, a quantity 9 of flowable, filled, polyester resin mix is poured along each strip 8 so as to wet the strip. Thereafter, as illustrated in Figure 4, a metallic reinforcing bar 10 is pushed into each recess 6, this action causing a portion of each, strip 8 to be pushed into its recess so as to line the latter, with strip edges 11 projecting from their recesses and lying along the upper surface 5, to such an extent that adjacent strip edges 11 overlap one another so that the reinforcing element 7 extends uninterruptedly from side to side of the mould 1 and terminates in close proximity to each sidewall 3.The bars 10 may be wholly contained within their recesses or may project slightly therefrom, the latter arrangement being illustrated. . As indicated in Figure 5, further mix 12 is then poured into the mould so as to cover the protruding edges of the bars 10, the mix being such that the filler settles to produce a relatively filler free, upper layer readily capable of wetting a sheet l3jfibreglass reinforcement applied as shown in Figure 6. Thereafte,r the resin is allowed to cure and then the fini shed component 14, shown in Figure 7, is removed from the mould. In Figure 8 is illustrated an alternative overlapping technique whereby projecting strip edges 11A are of relatively small dimension and a bridging strip 15 is laid along the upper surface 5 to connect adjacent strip edg es llA,and hence to ensure that the reinforcing element 7 is not interrupted. In Figure 9 is ilLustrated a further alternative in which a single sheet of reinforcing element is employed and hence overlapping is unnecessary to achieve side to side continuity of the reinforcing element 7
