# APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING PELLETS OR GRANULES

## Abstract
An extruder head 1 for molten material such as polymer has a die plate 6 orificed at 5, rotating blades 11 sweeping over the die plate to operate and fling outwards emerging short lengths 22 of molten material, and a surrounding free standing wall or curtain of high pressure water 14 around the blades to entrap and cool separate cut lengths without agglomeration. The wall of water can be formed of merging, or overlap ping, flat jets from nozzle 13, and must be essentially unin terrupted viewed from the centre of the die plate.
