# A separable slide fastener.

## Abstract
A separable slide fastener 10 comprises a pair of stringer tapes 11, 12 , a pair of rows of continuous coupling elements 13, 13 of thermoplastic synthetic resin sewn to the tapes, respectively along respective inner longitudinal ed ges, and a separable terminal assembly 20 located at a lower end of the coupling element rows. Connectors 19a, 19b of the endmost ones E₁, E₂ of the coupling elements located adjacent to pins 22, 23 of the terminal assembly 20 are fused with the respective stringer tapes 11, 12 , the pins each having a pair of opposite plates 31, 32 36, 37 disposed one on each side of the respective stringer tapes. In order to prevent the displacement of the endmost coupling elements E₁, E₁ , one of the plates 31, 36 extends beyond the other plate 32, 37 to overlie each said fused endmost connector 19a, 19b , the other plate 32, 37 terminating short of the fused endmost connector 19a, 19b .
