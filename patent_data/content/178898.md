# AN INDUCTIVE MAGNETIC TRANSDUCER

## Abstract
An inductive magnetic transducer for a multiple track head has a soft magnetic material closure pad 24 formed across a multiturn coil 22 . The closure pad 24 has a width corresponding to the track width at the front gap of the transducer and a width at the back gap area 12 of the transducer which is less than the width of the innermost turn of the coil 22 .
