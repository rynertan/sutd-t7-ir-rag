## Description
A SKI BINDINGThe present invention relates to a ski binding for use in racing and cross country skiing. More specifically the invention relates to a ski binding with a keeper means and means for pulling a ski boot into said keeper means and to retain it therein by means of a clamping device, which is preferably adjustable.There is related a number of problems to the new boot sole standards of lighter ski boots. This is primarily the case of the 50 mm Nordic Racing Norm . Said standard implies very small binding with small contact faces for the boot and such binding is therefore dependent on very small tolerances. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a solution where these tolerance requirements may be reduced in that the boot, as in previously known ski bindings, is pulled or pushed into a substantially plow shaped keeper means. This has also the advantage that wear on the front sole portion and on the vertical contact faces of the binding is compensated by pulling the boot into the binding.In Norwegian Patent 132.576 there disarranged two pins which are fixed relative to the longitudinal direction of the ski but movable in vertical direction through a tiltable mounting about a mounting point.In Norwegian Patent 47.867 the boot is pulled into a binding either by means of a hook connected to the frontmost end of the boot or by means attached to the heel.Norwegian Patent 107.796 is to some extent comparable with what is shown in Norwegian Patent 47.867. A bracket is attached to the boot and a clamping device can by means of an adjustable intermediate piece be brought in engagement with a hook on said bracket, so that the boot may be pulled into and retained in the ski binding. However it is not advantageous to have such brackets on boots, both because these increase the cost of the boot itself and because a binding consisting of several separate parts requires a very accurate and thus time consuming installation.Norwegian Patent 78.181 relates to a ski binding intended for slalom and down hill racing with means for releasable blocking of the swing action of the boot heel up from the ski by means of a rigid, possibly somewhat resilient, arm or plate extending in a rearward direction relative to the keeper means and intended to enter into a channel, an indentation or the like in the heel portion of the boot for thereby to cause locking of the heel to the ski. The said arm or plate is formed by an extension of the bottom plate of the keeper means or is fixedly attached to the keeper means or the upper face of the ski.Norwegian Patent 47.051 relates to a ski binding without any rear strap, comprising tabs known per se with inwardly directed projections bearing against the upper edge of the sole. A plate known per se and shiftable in the direc tion of the ski has on its upper face suitable means e.g. spikes which can be brought in engagement with the lower side of the sole, blocking devices being arranged to prevent the plate when moved in between said tabs to be pulled out again, so that the boot when arranged on the plate and moved therewith in between, said tabs will be firmly locked to the ski in coaction with said devices on the upper side of the shiftable plate, the blocking device and said inwardly bent projections on said tabs. Thus the boot is moved in the longitudinal direction of the ski during the clamping process.The clamping itself is provided by means of a resilient plate upon which a knob is placed being coactable with holes in said plate. If the boot should be of a form to most suitably be clamped by hole number two of the holes, it may so happen that this is not possible and that clamping therefore must take place by the first hole, whereby the risk is that the boot will not fit properly in the binding. The solution is therefore not particularly advantageous in practice.Norwegian Patent 63.959 relates to a binding consisting of two separate and on screwable parts, one part consisting of a clamping device with an adjustable intermediate piece and where a rear strap loop is intended to grip about the heel of the boot.Norwegian Patent 84.786 relates to a pretensionar for a ski binding where a tensioning device fixed to the ski is connected with the front end of a helical spring, the other end of which for regulation purposes is in thread engagement with a screw spindle connected to the rear strap. The screw spindle extends through the means supporting the front portion of the straps, and on the rear side thereof is provided with a service button for regulation of the connection and the tensioning is transferred to the rear strap. It is here the case of two separate main parts.In Norwegian Patent 130.563 there are fixed pins which are brought in engagement with corresponding holes in the toe part of the boot and where strap means may be clamped by means of a clamping device over the top of the front sole edge, thus to keep the boot retained in the keeping means of the binding.The present invention has an object to provide a ski binding which overcomes the many disadvantages of the known bindings and which is simple and cheap to manufacture and advantageous upon installation on the ski.The ski binding according to the invention is characterised in that the said means consist of a preferably U shaped fixing strap arranged in guides on the keeper means, the free upwardly extending ends of the strap being coactable with holes in the front sole portion of the boot, and that the substantially transverse portion of the fixing strap is engagable with said clamping device, so that the free ends of the strap upon depression of a tensioning arm of said clamping device pull the ski boot forwardly in the longitudinal direction of the ski and into said keeper means of the binding.According to a further feature of the ski binding the clamping means comprises an intermediate piece into one end of which said transverse portion of the fixing strap may be snapped and the other end of which is hinged to a middle portion of the tensioning arm, one end of which is hinge connected to the front, preferably upper, portion of said keeper means and the other end of which upon said depression causes forward pushing of the fixing strap. According to another feature the intermediate piece may be adjustable in length by letting it consist of two parts, one being screw shaped and the other threaded internally.According to another feature the forwardly directed end portion of the intermediate piece is preferably shaped to form contact face for an acting means, e.g. a ski pole point, said binding being releasable by depression of said end portion when it tilts about a portion raised above the top surface of the ski.According to still another feature of the present invention the fixing strap compasses substantially most of the clamping device.The invention is now to be described further with reference to the enclosed drawings illustrating the present invention as examples thereof.Figure 1 shows a first embodiment of the binding, seen from above, according to the invention. Figure 2 shows a longitudinal vertical central section through the binding in Figure 1.Figure 3 is a side view of the binding in Figure 1.Figure 4 is a second embodiment of the binding, seen from above, according to the invention.Figure 5 is a longitudinal vertical central section through the binding in Figure 4.Figure 6 is a side view of the binding in Figure 4.Figure 7 shows a cross section of the binding according to Figures 1 and 4, section VII VII.The binding has a keeper means 1 known per se for the front sole portion of the ski boot. The ski boot is provided with grooves or recesses 3 providing free passage for a movable, substantially U shaped strap 2, e.g. of metal wire, with upwardly protruding end portions 4 coactable with holes in the front sole portion of the boot, which holes may be arranged in accordance with accepted standards.The strap 2 is freely movable in the longitudinal direction of the ski and may thereby together with the boot be pulled forwardly and into the binding. The advantage of using a strap with the said configuration is based both on productional reasons and use. As regards production the number of parts are reduced because the upwardly projecting end portions coact with the boot. The advantage in use is the free movement of the strap in the spacy grooves or recesses 3.The movability of the strap is not barred by collection of snow or formation of ice, a problem that may be encountered with some of the known solutions. As illustrated in Figures 1 3 the binding has a tensioning mechanism 7, 8 consisting of a tensioning arm 7 and an intermediate piece 8. The tensioning arm is hinge connected 5 to the keeper means 1 and the intermediate piece 8 is at one end hinged 6 to substantially a middle portion of the tensioning arm 7 and at its other end snapped onto the transverse portion 9 of the strap 2. Upon depression of the tensioning arm 7, the upwardly extending ends 4 of the strap will be pulled into the keeper means 1 together with the boot. At the lower position of the tensioning arm 7, the hinge 6 forms a dead point so that the movement of the tensioning device in said position is locked.The reference numerals 13 indicate holes for attaching the binding to the ski by means of screws not shown . Three holes will normally be sufficient for the installation.In Figures 4 to 6 the intermediate piece 8 is provided with a longitudinal hole for introduction of a threaded bolt 10 adapted to be hinge connected 6 to the middle portion of the tensioning arm. If the intermediate piece is made of e.g. plastics, the bolt itself may provide the necessary internal threads in the intermediate piece, and expensive tools for casting the required threads or making threads through machining are unnecessary. However, it may still be suitable to make the length adjustable piece from e.g.brass or other suitable metal. A construction with a clamping mechanism being locked through a dead point is known, but since this function is acting conversely, so that the strap in a new manner lies around the structure, the components will be subjected to compression instead of tensioning. One may thereby consider a slimmer dimensioning than for the known solutions and thereby also reduction of weight.It is however important that by turning the construction one obtains an intermediate piece 8 at the front in such a manner that the binding may be released by a ski pole pin by letting the wide end portion 12 at one end of the intermediate piece in snap engagement with the strap branch 9 tilt about a front portion 11 of the keeper means when said end portion 12 is acted upon by said ski pole pin, whereby the hinged point 6 is brought above the dead point such that the binding is released. There is thus provided a ski binding which is more compact in that the clamping mechanism lays within the conture of the strap. The keeper means 1 and the tensioning arm 7 are preferably made from a suitable plastics material. The intermediate piece 8 with its integral end piece 12 may be made from e.g. reinforced plastic material or a metal. Thus, there is provided a binding which is small and light and which represents substantial technical advantages relative to the prior art bindings.
