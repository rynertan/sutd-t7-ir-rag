# CLEARANCE CONTROL FOR TURBINE BLADE TIPS

## Abstract
A turbine comprising a casing in which are disposed a turbine rotor assembly which provides a plurality of turbine blades and a guide vane assembly which provides a plurality of guide vane segments, and there being shrouds spaced from turbine blade tips. To control the clearance between the tur bine blade tips and the shrouds at a small value by simple structure, the guide vane segments are made movable freely in the radial direction and inside parts of the guide vane seg ments are fixed to a stationary member.
