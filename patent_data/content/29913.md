# Method of coarse scan fine print reproduction of an original and apparatus for carrying out the method.

## Abstract
A scanning device 12 having a relatively coarse scan resolution provides an analogue signal to an A D converter 16 which digitally encodes the signal according to a grey level scale. The encoded values are transferred over line 10 through modem 68 . At the receiving end the encoded val ues entered into a shift register 102 . At any one time in use the shift register contents includes the encoded grey level values for five picture elements of the original, the five ele ments forming a cross shape with an element above and below and at each side of a central element. The unit 106 combines the values supplied thereto in accordance with a series of predetermined algorithms The output of the unit 106 is gated to a comparing means 114 operative to com pare that output with pre calculated values held in store 116 . The result of the comparison sets or rests latch 118, 122 to control a printer which has a relatively fine printing resolution.
