# Polymer blend and flexible container made thereof.

## Abstract
Film material for use in sterilized medical solution containers such as blood bags or I. V. bags, comprising 30 90 linear low density polyethylene LLDPE and 10 70 styrene ethylene butylene styrene SEBS . The particular LLDPE and SEBS materials are selected from among known LLDPE and SEBS materials according to density, in the case of LLDPE, and styrene rubber ratio and composition in the case of SEBS. Up to 10 of an optional third component such as high melt index LLDPE or polypropylene may be added as a processing aid. Material having greater than 50 LLDPE is particularly well suited for medical solution contain er application.
