# Pick up and or cutter.

## Abstract
A pick up and or cutter 1 for scanning or recording information in a track of a disc shaped record carrier, which pick up comprises a stylus holder 2 , which at one end carries a stylus 3 , and which cooperates with two transduc ers, one for each of two orthogonal directions of vibration, each transducer being provided with a coil 6 and an associated magnet 5 . For each transducer the direction of movement of the coil relative to the magnet corresponds to the direction of the coil axis and the magnetic axis of the magnetic, which two axes coincide, the stylus holder being connected to the moving parts of the two transducers by means of a coupling member 8 and the coil being a flat coil. This enables the pick up to be constructed using a transducer with larger tolerances, which is obviously cheaper.
