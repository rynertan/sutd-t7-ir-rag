# Automatic liquid mixing system.

## Abstract
An automatic liquid mixing system having a reservoir 12 , containers 16 supported above the reservoir, means 42 for opening the containers into the reservoir and means for controlling the entry of liquid into the reservoir via inlet means 18 to achieve a desired mix of liquids. In order to improve the reliability and ease of operation of the system, there are means 56 responsive to the specific gravity of the liquid in the reservoir for controlling the entry of liquid via the inlet means 18 , liquid level sensing means also for controlling the entry of liquid into the reservoir and for controlling operation of the opening means 42 and a plurality of interfitting containers 16 which are held together for positioning above the reservoir as a unit. The opening means comprise a pair of blades 60a, b for opening a container wall by two spaced slits and a deflecting member 45 for displacing the material between the slits to allow egress of the contents and subsequent flushing of the container. The liquid level and specific gravity sensing arrangements involve magnetic coupling with sensitive components of the coupling being sealed from the liquids within a shaft which guides a liquid level float 30 and a specific gravity responsive float 56 .
