## Abstract
A rotor 1 receives the wet material to be dried and centrifugates it outwards with conveyance air created by the same rotor. Around the rotor there develops a first scroll 9, which receives and conveys towards an outlet the material centrifugated by the rotor and said conveyance air. The lateral wall 12 of said first scroll is provided with a bored grating 14, against which there hits the centrifugated material, which thus looses a part of the liquid that accompanies it another part is re moved by the same conveyance air, which filters partial ly through the grating into a second scroll 16 that con veys it to discharge with the liquid separated and passed through the grating.
