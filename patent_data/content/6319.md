# Gas or liquid fuel burner with air register control of tangential axial combustion movement.

## Abstract
A burner system for gaseous or liquid fuels adapted for insertion through a circular tile opening 27 in a furnace wall 26, 28 , comprising a burner tube 16 for alternate supply of gaseous or liquid fuel. The burner tube is coaxial with, and inserted into the circular opening. A first station ary annular vane assembly 39 comprises a plurality of symmetrically placed tangentially directed vanes 42 en closing a cylindrical open chamber 35 coaxial with and upstream of the burner means. A second movable assembly 47 of radial vanes 56 is adapted to slide axially about the burner tube and to be moved from a first position where it is entirely outside of the chamber space, inwardly to a second position, where it is entirely inserted into the cham ber space and inside of the first annular vane assembly 39 . Menas are provided for flowing combustion air at selected pressure through the tangential vanes 42 and into the chamber space. When the second vane assembly 47 is moved to its first position, the tangential vanes 42 provide a swirling helical flow of air into and axially along the chamber space and into the downstream of the burners 36 , providing a swirling flame. When the movable vane assembly 47 is in its second position, inside of the cham ber volume, then the tangentially directed air flowing through the first vane assembly 39 flows into the second vane assembly 47 with its radial vanes 56 . This com pletely cuts off the helical flow, and causes only axial flow of air past the burners 36 and into the flame zone 11 .
