# INLET AIR SWIRL CONTROL MEANS FOR I.C. ENGINES

## Abstract
Inlet swirl control means for I.C. engines includes, for each inlet port 12, 12 of an engine, a movable insert sleeve 35, 35 slidingly mounted in the inlet passage 13, 13 of the port as a liner for the passage, the or each insert sleeve having a profiled tongue 37, 38 at its inner end which projects to a variable extent into the bowl 14, 14 of the port. The disposition and degree of protrusion of each tongue into its associated inlet port bowl controls the degree of swirl generated in the associated cylinder. Simultaneous adjust ment of the dispositions of the protruding tongues 37, 37 of all the insert sleeves is carried out automatically during the running of the engine in response to variations in engine operating conditions such as engine speed and load. Such adjustment is effected by moving each insert linearly and or rotating it in its associated inlet passage.
