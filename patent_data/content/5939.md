# Compartmental syringe.

## Abstract
A compartmental syringe having an outer casing 1 open at one end and provided with a normally closed outlet 19 at the opposite end, a cylinder 6 reciprocable within the casing in which latter works a plunger the cylinder being spaced from the inner periphery of the casing to form an outer chamber 13 and the space within the cylinder forming an inner chamber 14 for containing materials to be mixed to form a composition for injection. A nozzle 12 on the cylinder extends through a sealing gland 17 and can be withdrawn therefrom to communicate the outer chamber with the inner chamber so that reciprocation of the plunger mixes the materials. The outlet 19 is opened after mixing and attached to a needle for injection.
