# Hydrocarbon prospecting method and apparatus for the indirect detection of hydrocarbon reservoirs.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for electromagnetic hydrocarbon exploration which is accomplished by implanting at least two pairs of electrodes into the ground. One pair transmits a signal into the earth, and the other pair receives the signal. min With proper processing the polarization and resistivity of the ground can be calculated. The components are arranged in a manner to insure that the electromagnetic coupling can be determined and can be removed from the measurements. Electrode spacing can be varied to focus on the anomalous stratum. If an anomalous stratum is discovered, it is cored to determine the nature of the material creating the anomaly.
