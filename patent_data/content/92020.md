# COMPOSITE STRUCTURE, PARTICULARLY FOR USE AS A PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD

## Abstract
A composite 24 is characterized by metal or alloy com ponent 26 having a thin refractory oxide layer 28 on a surface 30 thereof. Another metal or alloy component 32 has a thin refractory oxide 34 on its surface 36. A glass 38, having a closely matched coefficient of thermal expansion to the metal or alloy components 26 and 32, bonds the thin refractory oxide layers 28 and 34 and electrically insulates the first component from the second component whereby thermal stress between the metal or alloy components and the glass is substantially eliminated.
