# A process for making a urethane elastomer.

## Abstract
A process for making an elastomer for use in printing drive belts is disclosed wherein a mixture of approximately 2 equivalents of toluene diisocyanate consisting of about 88 wt. of the 2.4 isomer and 12 wt. of the 2.6 isomer is reacted with a polyether or polyester having difunctional primary hydroxyl groups to form a prepolymer. The pre polymer is then reacted with a diamine curing agent to form the elastomer.
