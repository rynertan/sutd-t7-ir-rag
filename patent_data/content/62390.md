# Scanner for scanning an object by means of ultrasonic radiation.

## Abstract
A scanner for periodically scanning an object to be examined with a beam of ultrasonic radiation. A trans ducer ZO mounted within a housing emits a beam of ultrasonic radiation. Said beam is guided and deflected respectively to a continuously rotating scanning reflector TR which is disposed opposite a stationary object re flector OR which is also directed to the object. The beam propagation path further includes first focussing means FL adapted to focus said beam to a focal point TF within said housing, and second focussing means OR adapted to focus said beam to a focal point within the object. In a preferred embodiment said first focussing means can be selectively adjusted. Thereby the focal area of said beam in the object can be conveniently shifted.
