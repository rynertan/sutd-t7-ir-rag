## Description
POLYOLEFIN LUBRICANT SYSTEMS AND POLYMER COMPOSITES CONTAINING SUCH LUBRICANTS Background Of The Invention The present invention relates to polyolefin lubricant systems and polymer composites containing such polyolefin lubricants. More particularly, the invention is directed to the use of polyolefin or polyolefin polytetrafluoroethylene blends as lubricants in polymer matrices to provide greatly improved friction and wear properties in the polymer composites. It is known that various solid and liquid lubricants can be dispersed in a polymeric matrix by melt mixing for the purpose of reducing the coefficient of friction, increasing the wear resistance and increasing the limiting pressure velocity LPV of the resulting polymer composite.For example, U.S. Patent No. 2,855,377 teaches that the incorporation of molybdenum disulfide lubricant particles in polyamides results in a lowering of the coefficient of friction. Similarly, U.S. Patent No. 3,287,288 teaches that the addition of degraded polytetrafluoroethylene particles to a resinous binder, including a variety of thermoplastic polymers, thermosetting polymers and rubbers, reduces the surface friction of the parent plastic material which may be used to form bearings or similar items. U.S. Patent No. 3,458,596 teaches that the addition of discrete, identifiable particles of polyolefin having a molecular weight greater than 500,000 to polyamides and polyacetals results in improved wear resistance and lowered coefficients of friction only if discrete particle phases are preserved during processing melt mixing . To our knowledge, polyolefins having a molecular weight lower than about 500,000 or polyolefins in which the particles do not remain as discrete particles after processing have not previously been recognized as lubricants for polymer matrices or as providing improved friction and wear properties to polymer composites. Brief Summary Of The Invention According to the present invention, it has been found that a blend of about 2 to 98 weight percent polyolefin and about 98 to 2 weight percent finely divided polytetrafluoroethylene acts as an excellent lubricant providing desirable friction and wear properties to polymer matrix materials.In addition, it has been found that polyolefins alone, when incorporated into polymer matrix materials in such a manner that the polyolefin does not remain as discrete, identifiable particles after melt mixing with the polymer matrix, provides desirable friction and wear properties to the resulting polymer composite. The polyolefin or polyolefin polytetrafluoroethylene blend lubricants of the present invention are generally added to the polymer matrix in an amount of about 1 to 30 weight percent of thepolymer composite. The polymer matrix may comprise any of a wide variety of thermoplastic polymers, thermosetting polymers, rubbers, or elastomers. The lubricant systems of the present invention preferably comprise polyethylene having a molecular weight of less than about 500,000. The description wh√¨ch follows is given by way of non limitative example of the invention. In contradistinction to U. S. Patent No. 3,458,596, we have found that it is.not necessary that an introduced polymeric lubricant filler remain in discrete phases throughout the polymer matrix in order to obtain substantial improvements in friction and wear properties. While it is true that high molecular weight polyethylene i.e., polyethylene having a molecular weight greater than about 500,000 may remain as discrete particles after processing in a polyamide matrix, we have found that lower molecular weight polyolefins also provide substantial improvements in friction and wear properties, even though the lubricant no longer exists as discrete particles in the polymer matrix when the composites are extruded and molded well above the melting point of the polyolefin lubricant.Further, we have observed synergistic lubrication effects from blends of polytetrafluoroethylene and polyolefins of various molecular weights. These lubricant blends were found to be useful in a broad range of polymers and polymer composites. The polyolefins which are useful as lubricants according to the present invention include, for example, polyethylene, polypropylene and polyolefin copolymers, such as ethylene propropylene copolymer. The polyolefin may have a molecular weight in the range of about 50,000 up to 500,000, i.e., low molecular weight polyolefins. In any event, as indicated above, the polyolefins selected should not be ones that will remain as discrete, identifiable particles after melt mixing with the polymer matrix or processing of the polymer composite. The polyethylene may be added to the polymer matrix in any suitable manner which will be evident to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the polyolefin may be in the form of a powder or pellets. In the case where the polymer matrix is also a polyolefin, a polyolefin lubricant will be selected which is of a different type than the polymer matrix. For example, if the polymer matrix is polypropylene, the lubricant may be polyethylene. Where the lubricant of the present invention comprises a blend of polyolefin with polytetrafluoroethylene, the polyolefin should comprise about 2 to 98 weight percent of the blend and the polytetrafluoroethylene should comprise about 98 to 2 weight percent of the blend. Preferably, the polyolefin should be in the range of about 20 to 80 weight percent of the blend, and the polytetrafluoroethylene should comprise about 80 to 20 weight percent of the blend. The polytetrafluoroethylene used in the lubricant blend should be in the form of a finely divided powder having a molecular weight of less than 4,000,000. Normally, polytetrafluoroethylene has a molecular weight in the range of about 4,000,000 to 6,000,000. Therefore, the polytetrafluoroethylene can be degraded or irradiated in order to obtain a fine powder from high molecular weight polytetrafluoroethylene. Low molecular weight polytetrafluoroethylene resins are also suitable. The polyolefin and polytetrafluroethylene may be either blended prior to mixing with the polymer matrix or may be added separately to the polymer matrix and thoroughly blended with the polymer matrix. The lubricant systems of the present invention may be added to polymer matrices in an amount of about l to 30 weight percent and preferably about 15 to 20 weight percent of the total polymer composite. Since polyolefins are much less expensive than polytetrafluoroethylene, it is desirable to replace as much of the polytetrafluoroethylene with polyolefin as possible. The lubricant systems of the present invention may be used with a wide variety of polymer matrices, including thermoplastic polymers, thermosetting polymers, rubbers, and elastomers. Examples of such polymer matrices include polyamides, such as polyhexamethylene adipamide, polyhexamethylene sebacamide, polycaprolactam, polycapryllactam, polyhexamethylene dodecanamide, polyhexamethylene azeleamide, polyundecanoamide, polylauryllactan, polyamide modified with carboxylic acids and oleo in copolymer and blends of the above polyesters, including polyalkylene terephthalates, such as polyethylene terephthalate and polybutylene tercphthalate, polyalkylene terephthalate copolymers, such as the segmented polyether ester copolymer derived from the condensation of dimethyl terephthalate, polytetramethylene ether glycol, l,4 butanediol and blends of the above polyesters polyoxymethylene, including homopolymers or copolymers thereof polyphenylene sulfide aromatic carbonate polymers, in particular the polycarbonate resin based onBisphenol A and phosgene styrenic polymers and copolymers including polystyrene, polyW methyl styrene, acrylonitrilebutadiene styrene, styrene butadiene styrene, acrylonitrilestyrene, styrene maleic anhydride, styrenemaleic anhydridemethacrylate, and styrenic alloys with poly 2,6 dimethyl l, 4 phenylene ether polyolefins, such as polyethylenes, polypropylenes and polyolefin copolymers such as ethylenepropylene copolymers polyurethane, such as linear thermoplastic polyurethane thermosetting polyesters thermosetting polyimides phenolics epoxies ureas melamines furans etc. In addition to the lubricant systems of the present invention, the polymer composites may also include other additives, including fillers, such as mica, wollastonite, talc, calcium carbonate, etc reinforcing agents, such as glass fibers, graphite fibers, aramid fibers, etc and additional lubricants, such as molybdenum disulfide, graphite powder, silicone fluid, etc. Other conventional additives for polymer composites will be readily apparent to those of ordinarv skill in the art. The lubricated composites of the present invention may be used in the same types of applications as other lubricated polymer composites of the prior art, including numerous situations where the surface of the composite bears against another surface, including plastic plastic surface contact, plastic metal surface contact, etc.It has been found according to the present invention that the lubricated composites of the present invention have greatly improved friction and wear properties in such situations, including lower coefficients of friction, increased surface wear resistance and increased limiting pressure velocity LPV . Moreover, while the above description is primarily directed to the concept of using the lubricant systems of the present invention as an internal lubricant for the polymer matrix, the lubricating systems of the present invention may also he used as lubricants for impregnating metal surfaces, for example, in much the same way as polytetrafluoroethylene powder is often used to impregnate metal surfaces for lubricating purposes. The present invention will now be illustrated in more detail by reference to the following specific, nonlimiting examples. Unless otherwise indicated, all percentages are by weight. Example 1 Polycarbonate composites were prepared by melt mixing 15 5 of a polytetrafluoroethylene lubricant powder LNP XL 140 and a blend of 8 polytetrafluoroethylene lubricant LNP TL 140 with 7 of a low density polyethylene powder USI iicrothene MU703 06 . In the case of the blend the polytetrafluoroethylene and polyethylene polymers were crvogenically milled and blended together prior to meltmixing. Each mixture of polycarbonate resin and lubricant was fed to an extruder, and the extrudate was comminuted into pellets. The pellets were injection molded into the appropriate wear specimen. The specimen is a 1 radius 2.54 cm disc with a thickness of about lf8 3 mm and having an annular ridge on one surface. The friction and wear testing of these specimens was conducted on a modified drill press in accordance with the thrust washer test method LNP um 1 , Wear factors volumetric weight loss measured in units of 10 10 in3min ft.lb.hr for each compound were based on equilibriwn wear rates independent of break in wear. The wear test is conducted at 40 psi, 50 ft min 2 76 bar, 15.2 m min at room temperature and against a mating metal surface of cold rolled carbon steel.After thermal equilibrium occurs, the frictional toraue generated is measured with a torque arm mounted on an anti friction bearing on the lower sample holder in the thrust washer test apparatus. The results of the friction and wear testing indicate that a substantial improvement in wear resistance and a reduced coefficient of friction can be achieved with the addition of polytetrafluoroethylene lubricant.However, the blend of 7 polyethylene and 8 polytetrafluoroethylene lubricant results in a still greater improvement in wear resistance and reduction in coefficient of friction as illustrated in the table below Polycarbonate ResinPolycarbonate with 15 PolytetrafluoroethyleneLubricantPolycarbonate with 8 Polytetrafluoroethylene and 7 PolyethyleneLubricantEMI7.1 tb Wear SEP Factor SEP I SEP Coefficient tb SEP of SEP Friction tb 10 10 SEP in min SEP s SEP D tb SEP ft.1b.hr. tb SEP 2500 SEP 1 SEP 0.31 SEP 1 SEP 0.38 SEP tb SEP 75 SEP 0.09 SEP 0.15 tb SEP 43 SEP 0.06 SEP 0.11 SEP tb Example 2 Styrene maleic anhydride copolymer composites were prepared by melt mixing the resin Arco Dylark 700 , glass fiber reinforcement P PG 3130 , and lubricant in an extruder.Specimens were prepared and tested as in Example 1.

Polymer polymer mated surfaces are known to generate catastrophic wear conditions. Polytetrafluoroethylene lubricant is commonly used to reduce wear rates in these instances.

A cylindrical journal bearing sample typically 3 4 ID X 3 4 long X 1 16 wall, 19 x 19 x 1.6 mm , is installed in an anti friction bearing mounted in the test apparatus.The anti friction bearing holder is equipped with a torque arm. Load is applied through the anti friction bearing to the test bearing. The shaft was rotated at the two test velocities of 100 fpm and 800 fpm 30.5, 244 m min . At each test velocity a load stepping test is conducted. Frictional torque and bearing temperature, which are plotted continuously, are allowed to reach equilibrium at each loading. The equilibrium condition is maintained for approximately 30 minutes, then the load is increased. At an advanced load increment, the frictional torque and or bearing temperature will not stabilize, The increase in torque or temperature will result in bearing failure. Neat polyamide 6 6 resin Monsanto Vydyne 21 yielded a very low value of 3,000 psi fpm at the 100 fpm test velocity 63.1 bar m min at 30.5 m min .The addition of 30 glass fiber reinforcement PPG 3540 resulted in an increase LPV to 12,500 psi fpm 263.1 bar m min . The addition of 15 polytetrafluoroethylene lubricant LNP TL 156 and 30 glass fiber reinforcement to the polyamide 6 6 resin results in a further increase in the limiting pressure velocity to 17,000 psi fpm 357.8 bar.m min at the 100 fpm test velocity 357.8 bar.m min . However, the addition of 30 glass fiber reinforcement, 3 polytetrafluoroethylene and 12 polyethylene lubricant to the polyamide 6 6 resin results in a composite yielding limiting pressure velocity of 23,000 psi fpm at the 100 fpm test velocity 484 barm min at 30.5 m min . A large increase in limiting pressure velocity is also noted at the 800 fpm 244 m min test velocity. See table below . These large increases in limiting pressure velocity demonstrate the usefulness of this lubricant blend as an additive in plastic materials for bearing applications.
