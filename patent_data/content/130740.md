# Separation of ortho aromatic isomers.

## Abstract
An improved process for separating ortho aromatic iso mers from a feed stream containing a mixture of aromatics by contacting the feed stream with a bed of the crystalline alu minophosphate adsorbent AlPOâ‚„ 5. The adsorbed ortho aro matic isomer is removed from the adsorbent by desorption.
