# Apparatus for cutting vegetation.

## Abstract
Apparatus 11 for cutting vegetation with a rotatable head 19 carrying a non metallic cutting line 21 extended into a cutting plane. Additional line is extended from a supply line coil 39 within the head into the cutting plane without independent operator action. A mechanism in the head automatically feeds replacement line whenever the fee end of the cutting line is reduced to less than a predeter mined maximum length in the cutting plane. The cutting line length is always extended to this predetermined maximum length at all operational rotationals speeds, without adjust ment, and in a positive step by step mode of segmental line advancement. The line feeder mechanism, has an escape ment cam 56 with an off center pivotal mounting 57 that senses both centrifugal forces on the cutting line and changes in rotary speed of the head.
