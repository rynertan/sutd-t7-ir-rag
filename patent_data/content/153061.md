# Digestor tanks.

## Abstract
A digestor tank 1 for sewage sludge has gas circulation pipes 4 opening low down in the tank for bubbling gas through the sludge to agitate the sludge. Some of these pipes are individuaily associated with heat exchanger jackets 3B, 3C of heaters 3 . Each gas circulation pipe 4 opens low down in the tank and such that gas exiting from the pipe does so in the direction towards the base 1C of the tank and low down in the sludge so that the sludge is scoured downwards to impinge on the tank base to remove sedimented materials and hence to prevent build up of such materials in the bottom of the tank.

## Description
DIGESTOR TANKSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to digestor tanks in which sewage sludge is treated, micro organisms being allowed to feed on the sewage sludge in the tank with the tank being operated at a suitable temperature and the contents of the tank being agitated to produce a uniform slurry for digestion.DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART In operation gas is produced that collects at the top of the tank and it is known to recirculate part of this gas back into the tank contents by means of a gas compressor and gas circulation pipes which deliver the gas to a point below the surface of the sludge in the tank, this gas then bubbling up through the sludge and thereby agitating the sludge. An example of such gas circulation equipment in a digestor tank is disclosed in British Patent SpecificationNo. 912,433. Other examples are disclosed in BritishPatent Specifications Nos. 911,164 1,023,550 1,050,274 1,451,398 and 1,600,979 and in UnitedStates Patent Specification No. 4,111,808.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention there is provided a digestor tank having a plurality of gas circulation pipes and pump means for pumping gas collected at the top of the tank through the pipes to pass into sludge in the tank, the pipes opening low down in the tank so that gas existing from the pipes is released to pass through the sludge in the direction from bottom to top of the tank the pipes opening such that gas exiting from the pipes does so in the direction towards the base of the tank and low down in the sludge so that the gas first serves to scour the sludge downwards to impinge on the tank base, the gas thereafter passing through the sludge in the direction from bottom to top. In operation scouring downwards of the sludge to impinge on the tank base serves to remove sedimented materials and hence to prevent build up of such materials in the bottom of the tank. Thereafter, as indicated above, the gas bubbling through the sludge in the direction from bottom to top agitates the sludge and the upward movement of gas to the top of the sludge serves to break up any concentration of light material at the upper surface. The digestor tank is also provided with at least one heater comprising a heat exchanger disposed to be in the sludge in the tank, the or each heat exchanger having one or a respective one of the gas circulation pipes mentioned above associated with it such that gas exiting from this pipe ensures optimum agitation of the sludge in the region of the heat exchanger. By ensuring optimum sludge agitation in the region of the heat exchanger, build up of sludge deposit on the heat exchanger in operation is minimised. The gas circulation pipes, the or each heat exchanger, a sludge feed pipe and other equipment inserted into the tank from the exterior all extend into the tank from the top and so as to be withdrawable from the top. This enables any such equipment to be removed and replaced without lowering sludge level, and lengthy shutdowns can thus be avoided.

Through the top wall 1A there are entered into the tank a sludge feed pipe 2, heaters 3 and gas circulation pipes 4. A slurry discharge pipe 5 extends from a discharge chamber 6 movably mounted not shown in Figure 1 but described below with reference to Figures 6 and 7 at the top of the tank side wall lA, this chamber 6 being separated from a gas collecting zone 7 at the top of the tank by a baffle 8 so that it is treated liquid slurry rather than gas that overflows through the discharge pipe 5.Also provided in the top wall 1A of the tank is an observation window 9. The equipment inserted into the tank from the exterior, that is the sludge feed pipe 2, the heaters 3 and the gas circulation pipes 4, and the observation window 9, is all supported form the top wall 1B without any fastenings, for example bolt heads, protruding into the interior of the tank 1. To these ends the window 9 is clamped between flanges, and each heater 3 is suspended from a flanged stool 10.Each gas circulation pipe 4 is also supported from the flanged stool 10 where the pipe is associated with a heater , or from its own flanged stool 11. Figure 4 illustrates how each pipe 4 is supported.Figure 4 shows one of the stools II but similar support is provided at the stools 10. A flanged support sleeve 12 bolted onto the stool it carries a gas tight gland 13 through which the pipe 4 passes slidably.Below the gland 13 the pipe 4 is slidably supported in a stiffening sleeve 12A. The slidable support for the pipes 4 enables the distance at which each pipe terminates above the base 1C of the tank to be set as desired. Alternatively, if height variation is not required, each pipe 4 can be held fast, as shown in Figure 4A, in a screwed socket 13A. Each heater 3 consists of a support framework 3A and a concentric array of cylindrical heat exchanger jackets 3B 3C depending from the framework 3A. The framework 3A depends from the tank top wall IB. The larger diameter jacket 3B depends from near the lower end of the framework 3A. The smaller diameter jacket 3C is supported from the jacket 3B and extends from the top of the jacket 3B to below the lower end of the jacket 3B.Within the framework 3A and array of jackets, 3B 3C there are heated water feed and return pipes 14, 15. Also within each framework 3A and array of jackets 3B 3C there runs the gas circulation pipe that is associated with the particular heater 3.This pipe 4 is offset from the axis of the array of jackets 3B 3C. In operation sewage sludge is supplied to the tank 1 via the feed pipe 2 to a level above the bottom of the baffle 8. Heated water is circulated through the pipes 14 and 15 to produce a desired operating temperature in the tank. Microorganisms feed on the sewage sludge and the gas produced collects at the top of the tank. Referring to Figures 6 and 7, the treated liquid slurry at the top of the tank 1 passes into the discharge chamber 6, which is slidably mounted in an upright framework 6A not shown in Figure 1 , via an outlet 16 and a flexible tube 17. Under the operating pressure in the tank 1 the level 18 inside the tank 1 rises to a level 19 in the discharge chamber 6. From this chamber 6 treated slurry flows down the discharge pipe 5. The level rise from level 18 to level 19 depends on the operating pressure of the digestor tank. By altering the height of the chamber 6 the level 18 in the tank can be regulated. To this end the discharge chamber height can be controlled by a screw 20 activated by a hydraulic motor 21 not shown inFigure 1 , mounted at the top of the framework 6A, to move the chamber 6 up and down on the framework 6A.To increase the level in the tank 1 the screw 20 is rotated so as to raise the discharge chamber 6 sufficiently high to cause the level 19 to drop to be within the flexible tube 17. As a result there is no discharge until the level 18 is raised in the tank by pumping more sludge in. Ultimately the level 19 rises into the discharge chamber 6 and treated slurry flows through an outlet pipe 22 that is slidably entered in the discharge pipe 5. To lower the level 18 in the tank 1 the discharge chamber 6 is lowered by counter rotation of the screw 20 and the level 19 in the chamber 6 effectively rises so that discharge takes place until the level in the chamber 6 drops to the level of the top of the outlet pipe 22 within the chamber 6. To prevent gas locking in the flexible pipe 17 when the chamber 6 is in this low position, a vent pipe 23 is fitted to the high point of the outlet 16. Similarly to prevent syphoning action a vent pipe 24 is fitted to the discharge chamber 6. Provided that the level 18 of sludge in the tank 1 remains above the bottom of the baffle 8, the pressure of the gas that collects at the top of the tank ensures that there is always material present between the baffle 8 and the discharge chamber 6 to act as a lock against gas escape, for example through the vent pipe 23. By the provision of the movable discharge chamber 6 there is, in effect, provided a variable height weir which facilitates operation by allowing sludge to be pumped into the digestor tank without discharge of slurry. Conversely slurry can be withdrawn when no feeding sludge is available. The construction adopted avoids any sliding seals or possible source of leakage or blockage. Operation can be from a remote panel and can be automatic. In order to agitate the sludge in the tank gas is pumped from the top of the tank down the circulation pipes 4 by pumping equipment not shown .This equipment can consist of an individual compressor for each pipe 4, or one, or more, compressors common to all, or common to groups, of the pipes. Each pipe 4 opens in the direction towards the base of the tank, and sufficiently close thereto that the gas exiting from the pipe does so in the direction towards the base of the tank and such that the sludge is scoured downwards to impinge on the tank base. Thereafter there is an upward stream of gas bubbles in the sludge, which stream carries with it some of the sludge and results in an upward movement of sludge gas mixture and a corresponding downward movement in the surrounding bulk of the sludge. This sludge motion in the area occupied by each heater 3 is indicated by arrows 27 in Figure 5, the array of jackets 3B 3C being open at top and bottom and the framework 3A being an open framework to allow this flow to take place.The flow of gas from the pipe 4 is shown by arrows 28 in Figure 5 and also in Figure 1 . The gas circulation pipe 4 associated with each heater 3 is offset as already described and see Figures 1, 2 and 3 to avoid obstructing a central flow of sludge within the jackets 3B, 3C. Build up of sludge deposits on these jackets is minimised by the agitation effected in the immediate vicinity of the jackets by the gas circulation pipe 4 therewithin, the sludge flowing upwardly inside each array of jackets serving to scrub the inner surfaces, and that flowing downwardly outside serving to scrub the outer surfaces. By the provision of the gas tight glands 13 the distance at which each gas supply pipe 4 terminates above the tank base 1C can be set as already mentioned , for example within a range of from 100 mm to 500 am from the base to suite sludges of from 3 to 8 solids content. In order to enhance the overall agitation effect, the supply of gas to the individual pipes 4 is controlled by valve mechanism not shown so that gas is ejected from each pipe in turn. The valve mechanism can consist of individual valves, one for each pipe 4, electrically controlled to open and shut in sequence at a timing that can be selected. This sequential feed of gas gives a stirring action which is achieved, it will be noted, without utilising any moving parts within the tank.Furthermore, onset of a blockage in any one of the pipes 4 is indicated by an upward change in ejector gas pressure for that pipe 4. A blocking pipe can be taken out of operation and cleaning can be effected by rodding from the top, or in extreme cases by completely withdrawing the pipe, again from the top of the tank, without lengthy shut down of the digestor tank as a whole since the remaining pipes 4 can continue in operation. Similarly if maintenance of one of the heaters 3 becomes necessary, the heater can be withdrawn from the top. From the above it will be appreciated that in the present tank by virtue of the absence of bolts or similar protrusions into the tank the possibility of gas or sludge leakage is minimised as all joints are made outside the tank. Moreover, all the joints are at the top of the tank so that maintenance or replacement of fittings can be carried out without shutting down the digestor for a lengthy time.Should there be a build up of solids at the bottom of the tank the components extending into the tank can be raised.
