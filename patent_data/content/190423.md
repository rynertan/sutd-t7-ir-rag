## Description
The present invention relates to semiconductor devices comprising Such a device is known from GB A 1348697. A planar semiconductor device comprises an impurity diffusion region formed by diffusing an impurity into a semiconductor layer of one conductivity type from its surface. The impurity diffusion region has a conductivity type opposite to that of the semiconductor layer. A planar junction formed between the semiconductor layer and the impurity diffusion region has an arcuated cross section. Fig. 1 shows a cross section of a semiconductor structure with a planar junction. Referring to Fig. 1, impurity diffusion region 2 of P conductivity type is provided in silicon layer 1 of N conductivity type. Region 2 is formed by diffusing an impurity into silicon layer 1. A planar PN junction is defined between layer 1 and region 2. Silicon oxide film 3 is formed on the major surface of layer 1. When the planar junction is reverse biased, a depletion layer is formed at the planar junction. In Fig. 1, part of the depletion layer formed only on the side of layer 1 is shown by the broken line. Generally, most part of a depletion layer is formed in a semiconductor region of a low impurity concentration, and less part is formed in a semiconductor region of a high impurity concentration. The less part of a depletion layer is very small and, therefore, can be considered to be negligible. A disadvantage of a planar junction is that it has a low breakdown voltage. This is mainly because, when the depletion layer is viewed in cross section, the arcuated portion has a relatively sharp curve and the portion of the depletion layer exposed on the surface of layer 1 is relatively narrow. When the depletion layer has the arcuated portion as such, an electric field is concentrated at the arcuated portion, causing breakdown. Further, when the portion of the depletion layer exposed on the surface of layer 1 is narrow, an electric field is concentrated at that portion of the depletion layer, causing breakdown. A semiconductor device with a field plate electrode, as shown in Fig. 2, has been proposed. The semiconductor device increases the area of the depletion layer exposed on the semiconductor layer 1. In the device shown in Fig. 2, field plate electrode 4 of a metal, such as aluminum, is formed on film 3. Electrode 4 extends, when viewed through film 3, from the vicinity of the junction between layer 1 and region 2 to layer 1. A negative voltage is applied to electrode 4. Electrons existing in a surface region of layer 1 are discharged into the inner region. As shown in Fig. 2, the portion of the depletion layer exposed on the surface of layer 1 is increased, thereby improving the breakdown voltage. However, the depletion layer still has sharply curved portions. Because of this, the electric field is concentrated at the curved portion and a high breakdown voltage cannot be obtained. In order to solve this problem, a further semiconductor device has been proposed, as illustrated in Fig. 3. A high resistance polysilicon layer is used as field plate electrode 4A. One end Y i.e., an end away from region 2 of high resistance polysilicon layer 4A is connected to a positive potential, and the other end X i.e., an end near region 2 is connected to a negative potential to cause small electric current i to flow from end Y to end X. Electric current i causes a voltage drop with a moderate potential gradient, as shown in Fig. 4. For this reason, the depletion layer shows a moderate gradient and has no sharply curved portion. Thus, electric field concentration can be eliminated, and a breakdown voltage can be increased, preventing breakdown. However, flow of electric current i results in a considerable power consumption. Furthermore, when the above structure is applied to a transistor, the transistor will fail to operate in a small current region. The present invention has been made in consideration of the above situation, and the object is to provide a semiconductor device wherein a depletion layer formed at a reverse biased planar junction shows a desired configuration so that a breakdown voltage can be increased, and a power consumption and an operation failure can be prevented. According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided a semiconductor memory device having the features initially defined and characterized in that said second semiconductor layer comprises a first semiconductor portion of said second conductivity type and a second semiconductor portion of said first conductivity type, said first semiconductor portion is adjacent said semiconductor region, said second semiconductor portion is adjacent said first semiconductor layer and said first and second semiconductor portions define therebetween a PN junction extending over the entire thickness of said second semiconductor layer. According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a semiconductor memory device having the features initially defined and characterized in that said second semiconductor layer comprises a plurality of first semiconductor portions of said second conductivity type and a plurality of second semiconductor portions of said first conductivity type, wherein said first semiconductor portions and said second semiconductor portions are provided alternately starting with a first semiconductor portion adjacent said semiconductor region and ending with a second semiconductor portion adjacent the first semiconductor layer thereby forming a plurality of PN junctions therebetween each extending over the entire thickness of the second semiconductor layer. This invention can be more fully understood from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which In Fig. 5, the present invention is applied to an NPN transistor. The NPN transistor comprises collector region 14, base region 15 and emitter region 16. Reference numeral 11 denotes silicon substrate of P conductivity type. Epitaxial silicon layer 14 of N conductivity type is formed on silicon substrate 11. Buried layer 12 of N conductivity type is formed between silicon substrate 11 and silicon layer 14. Silicon layer 14 is surrounded by separating region 13 of P conductivity type, thereby defining silicon layer 14 as the collector region of the NPN transistor. Separating region 13 separates the NPN transistor from other elements not shown . Base region 15 of P conductivity type is formed in collector region 14. Collector region 14 and base region 15 define therebetween a planar PN junction. Emitter region 16 of N conductivity type is formed in base region 15. Base contact region 17 of P conductivity type is formed in base region 15. Collector contact region 18 of N conductivity type is formed in collector region 14. Silicon dioxidation film 19 of a predetermined pattern is formed on the major surface of the semiconductor structure. Silicon dioxidation film 19 has contact holes leading to emitter region 16, base contact region 17 and collector contact region 18, respectively. Polysilicon layer 20 is formed on silicon dioxidation film 19 and above collector region 14 and base region 15. Polysilicon layer 20 extends, when viewed through silicon dioxidation film 19 i.e., when viewed from above in Fig. 5 from the periphery of base region 15 to collector region 14 i.e., outwards . Polysilicon layer 20 constitutes a field plate electrode. Field plate electrode 20 comprises polysilicon portion 22 of P conductivity type and polysilicon portion 23 of N conductivity type. Polysilicon portion 22 is, when viewed through silicon dioxidation film 19 i.e., when viewed from above in Fig. 5 on the side of base region 15. Polysilicon portion 23 is, when viewed through silicon dioxidation film 19 i.e., when viewed from above in Fig. 5 on the side of collector region 14. Polysilicon portions 22 and 23 define therebetween a PN junction extending over the entire thickness of polysilicon layer 20. Field plate electrode 20 is covered by silicon dioxidation film 21 of a predetermined pattern. Silicon dioxidation film 21 has contact holes leading to polysilicon portions 22 and 23 of field plate electrode 20, respectively. Emitter electrode 24 is formed on silicon dioxidation film 19. Emitter electrode 24 extends onto silicon dioxidation film 21. Emitter electrode 24 extends into the emitter contact hole formed in silicon dioxidation film 19 and contacts emitter region 16. Emitter electrode 24 also extends into the P portion contact hole formed in silicon dioxidation film 21 and contacts P polysilicon portion 22 of field plate electrode 20. Base electrode 25 is formed on silicon dioxidation film 19. Base electrode 25 extends into the base contact hole formed in silicon dioxidation film 19 and contacts base contact region 17. Collector electrode 26 is formed on silicon dioxidation film 19. Collector electrode 26 extends onto silicon dioxidation film 21. Collector electrode 26 extends into the collector contact hole formed in silicon dioxidation film 19 and contacts collector contact region 18. Collector electrode 26 also extends into the N portion contact hole formed in silicon dioxidation film 21 and contacts N polysilicon portion 23 of field plate electrode 20. When the semiconductor device shown in Fig. 5 is operated, potentials are applied to the device through electrodes 24, 25 and 26 so that the planar PN junction between regions 15 and 16 is forward biased and the PN junction between regions 14 and 15 is reverse biased. Therefore, a depletion layer is formed at the PN junction between regions 14 and 15. The PN junction between P portion 22 and N portion 23 of electrode 20 is also reverse biased. Fig. 6 shows electrode 20 with a depletion layer indicated by a cross hatched region formed at the PN junction between portions 22 and 23. Electrode 20 with the depletion layer is equivalent to a capacitor with the depletion layer as a dielectric, as shown in Fig. 7. Therefore, a potential gradient as shown in Fig. 8 is provided to electrode 20, although no electric current flows through electrode 20. Thus, a depletion layer is formed at the PN junction between regions 14 and 15 as shown by the dotted line in Fig. 9. The depletion layer has a smooth profile without a sharp curved portion. Therefore, breakdown does not occur, and the junction breakdown voltage can be increased. In addition, electric current need not flow through electrode 20, thus eliminating the power consumption. Since electric current does not flow through electrode 20, no operation failure occurs in a small current region. In addition, the portion of the depletion layer contacting surface of region 14 is wide and no breakdown occurs at the portion. A method of manufacturing the semiconductor device shown in Fig. 5 will be described with reference to Figs. 10A to 10D. Layers 14 and 12 and region 13 are sequentially formed on semiconductor substrate of P conductivity type by conventional known techniques. The surface of layer 14 is oxidized at a temperature of 1,100 C for 60 minutes to form film 19 of 600 nm 6,000 Å . Subsequently, a polysilicon layer of N conductivity type is deposited by CVD to a thickness of 500 nm 5,000 Å and is patterned to form polysilicon pattern 20 as electrode 20. The prospective base region of film 19 is selectively etched by photolithography, and dry oxidation is performed at a temperature of 1,100 C to form thin e.g., 100 nm 1,000 Å oxide film 21 on the surface of pattern 20 . Resist pattern 32 is formed on the major surface of the structure. Pattern 32 has an opening through which the base region 15 and prospective portion 22 of electrode 20 are exposed. Boron ions are implanted using pattern 32 as a mask, thereby doping the prospective base and P regions with boron ions. Pattern 32 is removed, and the resultant structure is annealed to activate the doped boron ions. Base region 15 and portion 22 of electrode 20 are thus formed. Thereafter, regions 16, 17 and 18 are formed by a known impurity diffusion technique, and electrodes 24, 25 and 26 are formed by aluminum deposition and patterning, thereby preparing a bipolar semiconductor device with the structure of that in Fig. 5. Fig. 11 shows another embodiment of the present invention. The structure of this embodiment is substantially the same as that of Fig. 5 except that field plate electrode 20 has alternately formed P and N portions 22 and 23. The same reference numerals as in Fig. 11 denote the same parts as in Fig. 5, and a description thereof is omitted. Also in the embodiment of Fig. 11, when the semiconductor device is operated, potentials are applied to the device through electrodes 24, 25 and 26, so that a plurality of reverse biased and forward biased PN junctions are formed between a plurality of P and N portions 22 and 23 in electrode 20. The detail is shown in Fig. 12. Each of the forward biased PN junctions is constituted, when the device is viewed from the top, by a given N portion 23 located near region 15 and a P portion 22 located outside given N portion 23, i.e., nearer region 14. Each of the reverse biased PN junctions is constituted, when the device is viewed from the top, by a P portion 22 located near base region 15 and an N portion 23 located outside given P portion 22, i.e., nearer region 14. In other words, reverse and forward biased PN junctions are alternately formed from region 15 to region 14. Although a depletion layer is formed in the forward biased junction, the associated potential gradient is small and can be neglected. Field plate electrode 20 with depletion layers of the reverse biased junctions is equivalent to series connected capacitors. The depletion layers serve as dielectrics, as shown in Fig. 13. Therefore, electrode 20 has a potential gradient, as shown in Fig. 14, although no electric current flows through electrode 20. Its potential changes stepwise slightly. Therefore, a depletion layer of a slight stepwise profile is formed at the PN junction between regions 14 and 15 as shown by the dotted line in Fig. 15. Thus, a breakdown does not occur and the junction breakdown voltage is increased. In addition, since no electric current flows through electrode 20, the power consumption does not occur. Furthermore, an operation failure in the small current region does not occur. The portion of the depletion layer contacting the surface of region 14 is wide so that a breakdown in this portion does not occur. A method of manufacturing the semiconductor device shown in Fig. 11 will be described with reference to Figs. 16A to 16D. Layers 14 and 12 and region 13 are sequentially formed by conventional known techniques. The surface of layer 14 on semiconductor substrate of P conductivity type is oxidized at a temperature of 1,100 C for 60 minutes to form film 19 of 600 nm 6,000 Å . Subsequently, a polysilicon layer of N conductivity type is deposited by CVD to a thickness of 500 nm 5,000 Å and is patterned to form polysilicon pattern 20 as electrode 20. The prospective base region of film 19 is selectively etched by photolithography, and dry oxidation is performed at a temperature of 1,100 C to form thin e.g., 100 nm 1,000 Å oxide film 21 on the surface of pattern 20 . Resist pattern 31 is formed on the major surface of the structure. In this case, pattern 31 has a plurality of openings. One of the openings exposes to prospective base region 15 and prospective portions 22 of electrode 20. Others of the openings expose to prospective P portions 22 of electrode 20. Boron ions are implanted using pattern 31 as a mask, thereby doping the prospective base and P regions with boron ions. Pattern 31 is removed, and the resultant structure is annealed to activate the doped boron ions. Base region 15 and portions 22 of electrode 20 are thus formed. Thereafter, regions 16, 17 and 18 are formed by a known impurity diffusion technique, and electrodes 24, 25 and 26 are formed by aluminum deposition and patterning, thereby preparing a bipolar semiconductor device with the structure of that in Fig. 11. Fig. 17 shows a further embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 17, the present invention is applied to an N channel MOS transistor. The same reference numerals as in the Figs. 5 and 11 denote the same parts as in Figs. 5 and 11, and a description thereof is omitted. The MOS transistor comprises drain region 54, back gate region 55 and source region 56. The MOS transistor further comprises drain contact region 58 of N conductivity type contacting buried region 12 and back gate contact region 57 of P conductivity type. Silicon layer 54 is surrounded by separating region 13 of P conductivity type, thereby defining silicon layer 54 as the drain region of the MOS transistor. Separating region 13 separates the MOS transistor from other elements not shown . Back gate region 55 is formed in drain region 54. Drain region 54 and back gate region 55 define therebetween a planar PN junction. Source region 56 of N conductivity type is formed in back gate region 55. Back gate contact region 57 is formed in back gate region 55. Drain contact region 58 is formed in drain region 54. Silicon dioxidation film 19 has contact holes leading to source region 56, back gate contact region 57 and drain contact region 58, respectively. Polysilicon layer or field plate electrode 20 is formed on silicon dioxidation film 19 and above drain region 54 and back gate region 55. Polysilicon layer 20 extends, when viewed through silicon dioxidation film 19 i.e., when viewed from above in Fig. 17 from the periphery of back gate region 55 to drain region 54 i.e., outwards . Field plate electrode 20 comprises polysilicon portion 22 of P conductivity type and polysilicon portion 23 of N conductivity type. Polysilicon portion 22 is, when viewed through silicon dioxidation film 19 i.e., when viewed from above in Fig. 17 on the side of back gate region 55. Polysilicon portion 23 is, when viewed through silicon dioxidation film 19 i.e., when viewed from above in Fig. 17 on the side of drain region 54. Polysilicon portions 22 and 23 define therebetween a PN junction extending over the entire thickness of polysilicon layer 20. Field plate electrode 20 is covered by silicon dioxidation film 21 of a predetermined pattern. Silicon dioxidation film 21 has contact holes leading to polysilicon portions 22 and 23 of field plate electrode 20, respectively. Source electrode 44 is formed on silicon dioxidation film 19. Source electrode 44 extends onto silicon dioxidation film 21. Source electrode 44 is common to back gate electrode. Source electrode 44 extends into the source contact hole formed in silicon dioxidation film 19 and contacts source region 56 and back gate contact region 57. Source electrode 44 also extends into the P portion contact hole formed in silicon dioxidation film 21 and contacts P polysilicon portion 22 of field plate electrode 20. Gate electrode 45 is formed on silicon dioxidation film 19 and above the channel portion. The channel portion is the surface portion of back gate region 55, which is between drain region 54 and source region 56. Drain electrode 46 is formed on silicon dioxidation film 19. Drain electrode 46 extends onto silicon dioxidation film 21. Drain electrode 46 extends into the drain contact hole formed in silicon dioxidation film 19 and contacts drain contact region 58. Drain electrode 46 also extends into the N portion contact hole formed in silicon dioxidation film 21 and contacts N polysilicon portion 23 of field plate electrode 20. When the semiconductor device shown in Fig. 17 is operated, potentials are applied to the device through electrodes 44, 45 and 46 so that the planar PN junction between regions 55 and 56 is forward biased and the PN junction between regions 54 and 55 is reverse biased. Therefore, a depletion layer is formed at the PN junction between regions 54 and 55. The PN junction between P portion 22 and N portion 23 of electrode 20 is also reverse biased. Electrode 20 with the depletion layer is equivalent to a capacitor with the depletion layer as a dielectric. Therefore, a smooth potential gradient is provided on electrode 20, although no electric current flows through electrode 20. Thus, a depletion layer is formed at the PN junction between regions 54 and 55, with a smooth profile without a sharp curved portion. Therefore, substantially the same results as those in the embodiments of Figs. 5 and 11 are provided. That is, a breakdown does not occur, and the junction breakdown voltage can be increased. In addition, electric current need not flow through electrode 20, thus eliminating the power consumption. Since electric current does not flow through electrode 20, no operation failure occurs in a small current region. Gate electrode 45 and field plate electrode 20 can be formed at a same step by patterning a same polysilicon layer. Fig. 18 shows a still further embodiment of the present invention. The structure of this embodiment is substantially the same as that of Fig. 17 except that field plate electrode 20 has alternately formed P and N portions 22 and 23. The same reference numerals as in Fig. 17 denotes the same parts as in Fig. 18, and a description thereof is omitted. Also in the embodiment of Fig. 18, when the semiconductor device is operated, potentials are applied to the device through electrodes 44, 45 and 46, so that a plurality of reverse biased and forward biased PN junctions are formed between a plurality of P and N portions 22 and 23 in electrode 20. Each of the forward biased PN junctions is constituted, when the device is viewed from the top, by a given N portion 23 located near back gate region 55 and a P portion 22 located outside given N portion 23, i.e., nearer drain region 54. Each of the reverse biased PN junctions is constituted, when the device is viewed from the top, by a P portion 22 located near back gate region 55 and an N portion 23 located outside given P portion 22, i.e., nearer region 54. In other words, reverse and forward biased PN junctions are alternately formed from back gate region 55 to drain region 54. Field plate electrode 20 with depletion layers of the reverse biased junctions is equivalent to series connected capacitors. The depletion layers serve as dielectrics. Therefore, the potential gradient on electrode 20 changes stepwise slightly, although no electric current flows through electrode 20. Therefore, a depletion layer of a slight stepwise profile is formed at the PN junction between regions 54 and 55. Therefore, substantially the same results as those in the embodiment of Figs. 5, 11 and 17 are provided. That is, a breakdown does not occur and the junction breakdown voltage is increased. In addition, since no electric current flows through electrode 20, the power consumption does not occur. Furthermore, since electric current does not flow through electrode 20, no operation failure occurs in a small current region. Gate electrode 45 and field plate electrode 20 can be formed in the same step by patterning of the same polysilicon layer. As is apparent from the above description, the field plate electrode is made of at least one P portion and at least one N portion. The P portion near the impurity diffusion region and the semiconductor layer away from the P portion are reverse biased, so that the depletion layer formed at the PN junction shows a smooth profile without a sharply curved portion and the portion of the depletion layer contacting the surface of the semiconductor layer is wide. Therefore, a breakdown does not occur. As a result, a semiconductor device having a high breakdown voltage can be provided. Furthermore, since no electric current flows through field plate electrode, and the power consumption does not occur. No operation failure also occurs in a small current region.
