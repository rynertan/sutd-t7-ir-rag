# Sealing assembly and method of sealing in a steam chamber and casing arrangement.

## Abstract
An assembly for sealing an interface 17 between a high pressure steam chest 13 and a casing 11 , wherein high pressure steam flows from the steam chest into the interior of the casing. The assembly comprises a sealing element 22 extending through the interface 17 for preventing direct contact between the high pressure steam and the interface, and joined to the steam chest 13 so that a steam tight joint is developed therebetween. The assembly further comprises a chamber 35 defined by the steam chest 22 , the casing 11 , and the sealing element 22 in communication with the interface 17 between the steam chest and the casing a first passageway 36 having one end in communication with the interior of the casing 11 and a second end in communication with the chamber 35 , for passing steam from the interior of the casing to the chamber and means 40 , 42 for developing a pressure differential across the first passageway 36 so that the steam pressure at the second end of the passageway is less than the steam pressure at the first end of the passageway. A low pressure region is provided having a steam pressure lower than the steam pressure in the steam chest 13 and a second passageway 44 is provided, having one end in communication with the chamber 35 and a second end in communication with the low pressure region for passing steam from the chamber to the low pressure region.
