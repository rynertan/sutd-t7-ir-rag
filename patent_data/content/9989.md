# Photographic recording material containing blocked photographically useful compound.

## Abstract
Photographic recording material comprising one or more blocked photographically useful compounds. The blocked compounds are photographic image dyes and photographic reagents. These compounds are blocked with a group which, under alkaline conditions, is cleaved from the compounds by an intramolecular necleophilic dis placement reaction. The compounds are resistant to unblocking under storage conditions but are uniformly unblocked under conditions encountered during photo graphic processing.
