## Description
A process for reclaiming used motor oil The invention is concerned with a process for refining used lubricating oil. The used oil is subjected to solvent extraction to obtain a paraffin rich phase, hydrogenation to eliminate unsaturated contaminants therein, and separation of the solvent to yield a high quality stock.Background Motor oils are lubricants produced from petroleum by conventional refining techniques. They consist of a complex mixture of paraffinic hydrocarbons whose structures and properties render the mixture effective as a lubricant for internal combustion engines and the like. Besides hydrocarbon mixtures, motor oils often contain up to 30 by weight of additives such as detergents, pour point depressants, stabilizers, and viscosity modifiers. These oils break do n during prolonged use, particularly at high temperatures, leaving various contarinants. During use in an engine, the motor oil becomes contaminated with various impurities such as carbon, grit, ash, gasoline, water, etal particles, particularly heavy metal residues, and other residues. Resins, oxidation products and unsaturated impurities can also be formed. In the past, most used motor oil has been discarded or directed to low grade uses such as road oil or blending with heavy fuel oils.With increasing interest in fuel conservation, greater use is being rade of motor oil reclaiming processes which can offer beans for recovery of most of this premium hydrocarbon resource. any of these processes have disadvantages such as a multiplicity of steps, high capital investnent, waste disposal probl s and low product recovery. Objects of the Invention It is an object of this invention to provide a method for treat ing oil which has been drained from the crankcase of an internal combus tion engine after residence therein during the engine s use. It is an another object of this invention to provide a process for reclaiming motor oil wherein used oil is subjected to solvent extrac tion It is a further object of the invention to provide a method of reclai .ing motor oil wherein the used oil is subjected to solvent extrac tion and the hydrocarbon extract is then subjected to a hydrogenation. It is still another object of the invention to provide a process of reclaiming used oils wherein the used oils are subjected to solvent extractnon, the hydrocarbon extract is hydrotreated, and the solvent from the extraction step is recycled. Descrirtion of the Invention In one etbodirnent of the invention motor oil is reclaimed by a process which comprises the steps of a contacting used motor oil with one or more organic solvents under supercritical conditions of temperature and pressure so as to produce an extract phase b separating some or all of the extract phase from the other products of step a c hydrogenating the extract phase from step b d removing organic solvent from the extract phase before or after step c and e recovering a hydrogensted oil product. The extract phase can usually also be characterized as an oil rich phase. Optionally, the used oil feed nay be processed through a flash separation or other separation device to remove impurities such as metals, water and or gasoline components. The oil feed may be combined with a portion or all of the sol vent preheated to extraction conditions held for a suitable period of time to effect dissolution of oilthereby producing a solvent containing extract which is relatively free of contazinants passed through a selara tion zone such as a cyclone, filter, or phase separator to remove solids, part or all of the solvent, and or undissolved residue and the vapor phase introduced to a catalytic hydrotreater along with hydrogen. If desired, the t Tature of the oil stream can be adjusted before hydrotreatment. Hydrotrcater effluent is expanded and optionally cooled to condense refined oil which is removed from the system at the flash separator, Separator vapor is cooled and condensed to recover liquid solvent which can be recycled to the extraction step and hydrogen gas which nay be recompressed and recycled to the hydrotreater. The following ranges for process variables are suggested Range Preferred RangeExtraction Temperature OC 100 500 200 400Extraction Pressure, psig. 200 2000 500 1500 Extraction Residence Time, min. 1 60 10Extract Residue Split by w eight 90 10 97 3 95 5Feed Solvent Ratio Chy weight 1 1 1 10 1 5 2 5 Solvents suitable for the supercritical extraction include single ring aromatics having not more than 3 carbon atoms on substituent groups, alicyclic hydrocarbons having at least 5 but less than 10 carbon atoms and acyclic hydrocarbons having at least 3 but not more than 10 carbon atoms preferably C3 C7 num alkanes. Mixed solvents can also be used. By hydrogenation or hydrotreating is meant addition hydrogenation, which is the reaction of hydrogen with non anomatic unsaturation to produce a saturated product. Well known catalysts are conven tionally eployed. Evdrogen2tion reactions are distinct from hydro genol sis or destructive hydrogenation reactions which cause the rupture of the bonds of organic copounds and the subsequent reaction of hydrogen with the resultant fragments.A discussion of this distinction may be found in Condensed Chemical Dictionary, 9th Edition 1977 The hydrogenation or hydrotreating step is conventional except for the presence of supercritical solvent which passes through unscathed unless it is aromatic, in which event a small fraction nay be hydrogenated.Suitable catalysts useful in this step included those utilizing Group VIB and Group VIII metals or combinations thereof using a refractory support. Conventional hpdrodesulfurizer conditions can be used. Suitable hydrode sulfurization processes are disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,770,619 and 4,110,205 It is preferred to operate the hydrodesulfurizer at about the same pressure as the extraction step. In some cases, these two operations can be carried cut at about the same temperature, but the temperature can be adjusted for hydrotreating. The oil product from the process is a c uality hydrocarbon base stock. It is believed to be equivalent to any virgin or unused hydrocarbon stock. Accordincls. it can be mixed with conventional add ives and subjected to conventional treatment to render it more useful as a lubricating oil. Used motor oil and n heptane solvent were pumped to a nitrogen pressurized one liter extraction vessel maintained at about 3000C and 750 psig 5.26 MPa . Pumping rate was about 10 ml min for each fluid, and the fluids were preheated to about 3000C before introduction into the reactor. After approximately 35 ninutes, product take off compenced while pupping of both fluids continued at the same rate until 550 ml of n heptane and 503 ml of oil had been added. Introduction of used oil was then discontinued, but pumping of n heptane solvent continued at 10 ml min for another 2 hours to purge out the extracted oil.Product from the extrac tion was condensed and recovered. An analysis is given in the table following Example II. EXAMPLE II A similar run was made using n pentane solvent at extraction conditions of 2250C and 750 psig 5.26 MPa . An analysis is given below.

In E aple 1, for each 100 parts of feedstock, the total ash content was .4 x 2694 1.99 plus 92.6 x .0104 0.96, or 2 95 parts total ash. Since 1.99 parts ash was in the residue the percentage in the residue wasEMI4.1 Likewise, for Example II, each 100 parts of feedstock contained 14.5 x .216 3.13 plus 85.5 x 0.91 0.78, or 3.91 parts total ash. Since 3.13 parts ash remained in theEMI5.1 of the ash remained in the residue. Both of the above examples demonstrate that high percentages of ash retain in the residue. Reasonable variations which will become apparent to those skilled in the art can be made in the present invention without departing from its spirit and scope.
