## Description
This invention relates to an operating member for an overcentre mechanism of the kind wherein a body is mounted for pivoting movement about an axis between first and second angularly spaced positions and is moved between the first and second positions alternately by subsequent respective movements of an operating member towards said axis in a direction generally perpendicular to said axis, the body having a spaced pair of recesses separated by a wedge shaped projection, the projection having its apex presented generally towards the operating member and its inclined faces leading respectively into said recesses, the operating member when moved towards said axis with the body in its first position engaging one of said inclined faces, riding down said inclined face into the respective recess, and thereafter causing pivoting of the body to its second position, so that during the next sub sequent movement of the operating member towards said axis the operating member engages the other inclined face of said projection, rides into the other of said recesses, and pivots the body back to its first position. Overcentre mechanisms of the kind specified are found in certain electrical switches, for example those where subsequent identical movements of an operating member are to achieve different functions, such as switching a device on and off, or alternately energising two different circuits. Such mechanisms can however be found in other technological fields, for example opening and closing a valve, or operating a change over valve. In a previously proposed mechanism of the kind specified the pivotable body is a movable part of an electric switch, and carries a bridging contact engageable with sets of fixed contacts on a relatively fixed part of the switch.The switching mechanism including the pivotable body is only one of several switching mechanisms incorported within the same assembly, and several switching mechanisms are intended to be operated by different respective movements of a single lever. Thus the pivotable body is positioned within a housing, and a lever extends from the housing and is movable relative thereto to operate various of the other switching mechanisms within the housing.The body is intended to be pivoted between its stable positions by rectilinear sliding movements of a knob of the lever along the length of the lever towards the housing. X push rod extends slidably through the lever from the knob, and carries at its inner end a flexible, but non extensible finger in the form of a thin strip of spring steel. The end of the finger remote from the push rod is intended to engage the pivotable body to cause pivoting of the body, and the finger is arranged with the plane of the strip parallel to a plane containing the axis of pivotal movement of the body, and the apex of the wedge shaped projection. During use of this previously proposed arrangement problems have arisen as a result of an operator moving the knob rectilinearly relative to the lever to move the pivotable body while at the same time moving the lever bodily to operate a further switching mechanism of the assembly. The problem arises as aresult of the compound.movement perform ed by the flexible finger while engaged with the body which of course can pivot only about a single axis. The compound movement of the finger relative to the pivotable body can apply a side loading to the finger in the plane of the strip from which the finger is formed. The finger cannot of course flex in response to side loading in this direction, and thus damage to the connection between the finger and the push rod, and or damage to the pivotable body can occur, and it is an object of the present invention to provide an operating member for an overcentre mechanism of the kind specified wherein this problem is minimized. According to the invention, an operating member for an overcentre mechanism of the kind specified comprises a rectilinearly movable carrier, and an operating finger secured to the carrier and extending therefrom in the direction of rectilinear movement of the carrier, said operating finger being defined by a helically wound spring the convolutions of which, in the rest condition of the spring, are in contact with one another, and the axis of which, in the rest condition, is parallel to the axis of rectilinear movement of the carrier, the spring, in its rest condition, being capable of transmitting a push force in the direction of its axis, but being capable of being flexed relative to the carrier when subject to a loading other than in the direction of its axis. Desirably the carrier is formed with a bore the axis of which is parallel to the axis of rectilinear movement of the carrier, and a length of the spring is received in said bore as a tight fit to secure the spring to the carrier. Alternatively the carrier is formed with an integral cylindrical post the diameter of which is substantially equal to the internal diameter of the spring, and the axis of which is parallel to the axis of rectilinear movement of the carrier, the post being received within one end region of the spring, and the spring tightly gripping the post to secure the spring to the carrier. Preferably one end of said spring is loosely received in a bore in the carries, the bore having its axis parallel to the axis of rectilinear movement of the carrier, the spring, within the bore, tightly gripping a post integral with the carrier, the post having its axis coextensive with the axis of the bore, and the length of the post being less than the length of the bore so that the post terminates within the spring short of the open end of the bore from which the spring extends. Conveniently the region of said open end of the bore is chamfered and said post terminates within the bore short of said chamfered region. Preferably the end convolution of the spring remote from the carrier is shaped to define a rectangular loop the plane of which is parallel to the axis of the spring in the rest condition of the spring, the end limb of the rectangular loop remote from the remainder of the spring extending transverse to said axis. Conveniently the plane of said rectangular loop contains said axis. One example of the present invention is illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein Figure 1 is a diagrammatic sectional view of an operating member for an overcentre mechanism Figure 2 is a view similar to Figure 1 of an alternative operating member Figure 3 is a view similar to Figures 1 and 2 of a further alternative operating member Figure 4 is a diagrammatic side elevational view to an enlarged scale of the operating finger of the members illustrated in Figures 1 to 3 Figure 5 is a plan view of the finger shown in Figure 4 and Figure 6 is a diagrammatic representation of an overcentre mechanism utilizing the finger of Figures 1 to 5. Referring first to Figures 1 4 and 5 of the accompanying drawings the operating member for an overcentre mechanism includes a relatively rigid metal push rod 11 carrying at one end thereof, a moulded synthetic resin block 12. The block 12 is moulded around the push rod 11 to secure the block 12 to the push rod 11, and the block 12 includes an integral spigot 13 of reduced diameter extending back along part of the length of the push rod 11 from the block 12. The block 12 is formed at its end remote from the spigot 13 with a cylindrical bore 14 the axis of which is coextensive with the axis of the spigot 13 and push rod 11.Received within the bore 14 is one end of an operating finger defined by a helically wound wire spring 15. The spring 15 is so wound that in its rest condition the convolutions of the spring are touching one another, the spring thus being axially rigid in respect of compressive loading. The convolutions of the spring received within the bore 14 are a tight fit in the bore 14 and thus friction between the convolutions of the spring within the bore, and the wall of the bore serve to secure the spring 15 to the block 12. At its open end the bore 14 may be provided with a small nlead in taper whereby the end of the spring is guided into the bore, the spring then being subject to a strong axial loading to drive the spring into engagement with the closed end of the bore.Alternatively of course the spring may, if desired, be screwed into the bore in the manner of a bolt being screwed into a nut.Although the wall of the bore 14 does not carry a formation mating with the helical threads of the spring, the rotation of the spring relative to the block 12 will screw the spring into the bore. The spring 15 extends from the block 12 with its axis coincident with the axis of the push rod 11. The last convolution of the spring 15, at the end of the spring remote from the block 12, is shaped to define a rectangular loop 16 lying in a plane containing the axis of the spring. The end limb 17 of tne rectangular loop lies perpendicular to the axis of the spring in its rest condition, and is bisected thereby. In use, the operating member is associated with a hollow lever 19, the push rod 11 extending slidably through the lever 19. The spigot 13 has an external diameter fractionally smaller than the integral diameter of the lever 19, and is received as a sliding fit in the lever 19. The end of the push rod 11 remote from the block 12 extends from the lever 19 to facilitate movement of the operating member relative to the lever 19 in the direction of the axis of the push rod. In a modification of the above assembly, as shown inFigure 2, the block 12 is formed with an integral cylindrical post 21 in place of the cylindrical bore 14. The axis of the post 21 is co extensive with the axis of the push rod 11 and spigot 13 and the extemal diameter of the post 21 is substantially identical to the internal diameter of the spring 15. The spring 15 is secured to the block 12 by being driven over the post 21, so that the post 21 lies within the convolutions of the spring 15 adjacent one end of the spring 15. The convolutions encircling the post 21 grip the post 21 sufficiently tightly to retain the spring 15 on the block 12. During use of the constructions shown in Figure 1 and 2 as will be described in more detail below the spring 15 may be deflected from its axial configuration by forces acting transverse to the spring axis. While both the Figure 1 and the Figure 2 constructions represent a significant advance over the prior art constructions they can both, in certain circumstances, suffer from a minor disadvantage in that there may be resistance to the spring returning, after the transverse forces have been relieved, to the axial configuration. It will be recognised that when the spring ofFigure 7 or Figure 2 is deflected laterally then it will, at some point along its length, assume a bend at which the convolutions on the outside of the bend are opened with respect to one another.In the Figure 1 construction the bend takes place about the edge of the bore 14 at the open end of the bore, and thus at the outside of the bend, convolutions may be pulled from the bore as they open with respect to one another. when the force deflecting the spring is relieved the spring will, under its okn inherent resilience, try to assume its axial configuration. However, it will be recalled that the convolutions are a tight fit in the bore 14 and thus those convolutions which were pulled from the bore by the bending action may not completely enter the bore, to lie in their intended rest positions.Binding between the convolutions and the wall of the bore may prevent the convolutions settling back into their original positions and thus the spring outside the bore will be straight, but may have its axis inclined to the axis of the bore 14 as a result of the binding of the convolutions against the wall of the bore. In the construction shown in Figure 2, the bending will take place about the free edge of the post 21, and thus convolutions at the outside of the bend will be pulled around the edge of the post 21. When the force deflecting the spring is relieved it may sometimes happen that the edge of the post 21 will become lodged between a pair of convolutions which were opened with respect to one another during the bending action, and once again although the spring beyond the post 21 will return to a straight configuration it will have its axis inclined with respect to the axis of the post as a result of the edge of the post entering between a pair of convolutions. In the arrangement illustrated in Figure 3 this minor difficulty óf the Figures 1 and 2 arrangements is overcome.The block 12 is coupled with the push rod 11 and is associated with the lever 19 in any convenient manner, for example as described with reference to Figures 1 and 2. The block 12 is formed with an axial bore 20 the diameter of which is such that the end of the spring 15 can freely be inserted into the bore. Upstanding from the base of the bore, and having its axis coincident with the axis of the bore 20 is a post 21 which extends into the end of the spring 15. The free end region of the bore 20 is chamfered at 20a to produce a flared open end region of the bore. The diameter of the post 21 is such that the convolutions of the spring 15 encircling the post 21 grip the post 21 sufficiently tightly to retain the spring 15 in position relative to the block 12.The length of the post 21 is approximately half the length of the bore 20 and thus the post 21 terminates within the spring, well short of the chamfered region 20a of the bore 20. The free end of the post 21 can, if desired, be provided with a slight chamfer to assist in locating the spring 15 over the post during assembly of the spring to the block 12. The operation of the construction shown in Figure 3 when subject to lateral forces is as follows. The spring 15t if subject to a lateral force, will flex, and as with the construction shown in Figures 1 and 2 the bend produced in the spring will necessitate opening of the convolutions of the spring at the outside of the bend. Owing to the presence of the wall of the bore 20 the spring cannot bend at the end of the post 21 and thus there will be no opening of the convolutions of the spring adjacent the post 21 and no possibility of the edge of the post 21 preventing return of the spring to its axial configuration. By virtue of the bore 20 the bending will be constrained to take place adjacent the open end of the bore 20, and thus will take place over the chamfered region 20a. However, it will be recalled that the diameter of the bore 20 is such that the spring is a loose fit, and of course in the chamfered region 20a the fit is even more loose, and thus there is no risk of the convolutions of the spring binding against the wall of the bore during restoration of the spring to its axial configuration. Thus the construction of Figure 3 overcomes the minor disadvantage mentioned in relation to the construction of Figures 1 and 2. The operating member, whether it be the construction of Figure 1, Figure 2 or Figure 3, can be used in conjunction with an overcentre mechanism of the kind shown in Figure 6. A moulded synthetic resin rocker member 22 is mounted for pivotal movement about an axis 23 between first and second angularly spaced positions. A curved surface 24 of the member 222 having its centre of curvature on the axis 23, is formed with a pair of part spherical depressions 25, 26 which can be engaged alternately by a spring pressed ball 27. The ball 27 and recesses 25, 26 define a detent arrangement for retaining the rocker member 22 in either of its angular positions. The face of the rocker 22 is presented generally towards the operating member is formed with a spaced pair of recesses 28, 29 and includes, between the recesses 28, 29 a wedge shaped projection 31.The linear apical edge 32 of the projection 31 is presented generally towards the operating member, and lies parallel to the axis 23. In the first angular position of the rocker member 22 about the aixs 23 the apex 32 lies on one side of a continuation of the axis of the operating member, and in the second angular position, where the ball 27 engages in the recess 26, the apical edge 32 lies on the opposite side of the continuation of the axis of the operating member. With the rocker 22 in its first angular position, as shown in Figure 6, movement of the operating member towards the rocker causes the limb 17 of the loop 16 of the spring to engage the inclined face 33 of the projection 31. The face 33 leads from the apex 32 into the recess 29, and the arrangement is such that the limb 17 engages the face 33 close to, if not actually in the recess 29.Further movement of the operating member thus causes the limb 17 of the loop 16 to lodge in the recess 29 and further movement of the operating member in the same direction causes pivotal movement of the rocker member 22 in a counter clocinsise direction about the axis 23 to move the rocker member 22 to its second angular position. The operating member is spring urged in a direction away from the rocker member 22, and so upon release of the operating member with the rocker member 22 in its second angular position the limb 17 of the loop 16 with be withdrawn from the recess 29. During the movement of the rocker member 22 the spring 15 will have been flexed laterally, but as the operating member withdraws the spring 15 will restore to its axial configuration.In the movement of the rocker member 22 to its second angular position the apical edge 32 moves across from one side of the path of movement of the operating member to the opposite side, and thus when the operating member is again moved along exactly the same axial path the limb 17 of the loop 16 will engage the inclined face 34 leading into the recess 28. The arrangement of the rocker member 22 is such that the limb 17 engages the face 34 closely adjacent, if not actually in the recess 28, and further movement of the operating member will of course return the rocker member 22 to its first angular position. The rocker member 22 is thus bistable, and is moved between its two stable positions by consecutive, identical movements of the operating member. The rocker member 22 operates electrical switch contacts, and is carried by a relatively fixed part of the body of a multi function electrical switch. The lever 19 through which the pushrod ll extends is the operating member of the multifunction switch, and is movable in mutually perpendicular planes relative to the remainder of the switch.The push rod 11 is connected at its end remote from the block 12 to a knob slidable rectilinearly on the lever 19, and thus when only the switching mechanism controlled by the rocker member 22 is being operated, then the lever 19 is stationary and the knob is moved relative to the lever 19 in a direction towards the body of the switch, and against the action of a return spring, During such opr eration the spring 15 will only be flexed from its axial configuration to one side or the other of its axis in a plane at right angles to the plane of the loop 16. However, it may occur that while the rocker member 22 is being operated by rectilinear movement of the push rod 11 the lever 19 is also being moved to operate one of the other switching functions of the multi function switch.The push rod 11, block 12 and spring 15 will of course move with the lever 19 and thus their angular relationship to the rocker member 22 will be altered. In such circumstances the spring 15 may well be subject to deflections other than in a plane at right angles to the loop 16, but no damage will result because the spring 15 can of course be flexed in any direction away from its axis and will restore to its axial configuration immediately the deflecting load is removed. Thus, for example, during such compound movement of the spring 15 Sresulting from move ment of the lever 19 while the push rod 11 is being moved rectilinearly, the spring may be subject to a loading, immediately it abuts the rocker member 22, which deflects the spring in a plane containing the plane of the loop 16, this of course being a deflection of the spring which is not encountered by the spring when only the rocker member 22 is being operated.
