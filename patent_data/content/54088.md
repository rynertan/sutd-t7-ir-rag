# Improvements in or relating to gas operated, automatic or semi automatic guns.

## Abstract
A gas operated gun having a receiver 1 including a rear wall 100 at one end and a barrel 10 at the other end and a bolt carrier assembly 3 reciprocal within the receiver is arranged to cooperate with a main drive spring 307 that urges the bolt carrier assembly toward the barrel. The gun is designed so that in one aspect of the invention on an automatic cocking cycle the bolt overtravels the cartridge feed station by an amount equal to or greater than the overall length of a live cartridge. In a further aspect, the gun is additionally designed using parameters calculated such that a substantially con stant reaction is felt by a user. The parameters involved are essentially the product of sprung weight the total weight in kg. of all components driven by the main spring x springing force an average value of spring force that accelerates and retards the sprung weight x cycling distance the length of allowable travel of the bolt carrier assembly in meters is equal to 0.51 Â² x 0.5g 15 where 1 is the cartridge impulse and g is the acceleration due to gravity. The length of allowable travel of the bolt carrier assembly is arranged such that the assembly does not impact a positive stop 100 .
