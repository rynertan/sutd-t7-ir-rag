# HIGH STRENGTH, REDUCED HEAT DISTORTION TEMPERATURE THERMOPLASTIC COMPOSITION

## Abstract
New and improved thermoplastic compositions are disclosed comprising a blend of an aromatic polycarbonate and a copolymer derived from a glycol portion comprising 1,4 cyclohexanedimethanol and ethylene glycol present in molar ratios of 1 4 to 4 1 respectively and an acid portion comprising an aromatic dicarboxylic acid selected from terephthalic acid, isophthalic acid, and mixtures thereof. The compositions are compatible with, and advantageously contain impact modifiers and flame retardants. The copoly mer of the subject invention has a heat distortion tempera ture of from 60 C to 70 C. and when incorporated in the thermoplastic compositions of this invention provides poly carbonate based compositions which exhibit lower heat distortion temperatures while retaining good tensile, flexural and impact strengths. The lower heat distortion temperatures of the composi tions permits them to be molded and processed at lower temperatures thereby avoiding the degradation of the mate rials with concomitant loss in impact strength observed with higher conventional molding temperatures employed with earlier compositions.
