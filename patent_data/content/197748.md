# Magnetic alteration of cellulose during its biosynthesis.

## Abstract
A method of producing cellulose of amorphous charac ter comprises subjecting cellulose producing organisms to a magnetic field substantially greater than 0.5 gauss and preferably at least 500 gauss. The cellulose produced in the presence of a magnetic field is of an amorphous nature with increased water absorption and decreased crystallinity.
