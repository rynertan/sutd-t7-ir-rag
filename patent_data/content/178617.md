# Steam turbine plant having a turbine bypass system.

## Abstract
A reheat steam turbine power plant having a boiler 10 with a superheater 11 and a reheater 12 13 disposed therein, a high pressure steam turbine 21 , an intermediate pressure steam turbine 22 23 a low pressure turbine 24 , and a condenser 30 condensing a steam exhausted through the low pressure turbine to a condensate. A turbine bypass pipe 53 63 is provided with a bypass valve 51 61 . A branch pipe 64 54 branches off a cold reheater pipe 42 44 between the check valve and the reheater 12,13 is con nected to the condenser for introducing steam flowing through the turbine bypass pipe. A control valve 68 58 is arranged in the branch pipe and a controller 200 controls the bypass valve and the control valve. When the turbine bypass line is operational in one of a start up or an auxiliary operation of the power plant, the control valve and the bypass valve are controlled by the controller so that the quantity of reheat steam introduced into the reheater is the controlled and excess or surplus steam is discharged to condenser 30 through the branch pipe.
