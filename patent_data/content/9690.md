# Use of polyvinylidene chloride in the preparation of polymeric materials.

## Abstract
A crosslinked vinylidene chloride polymer micro gel powder is recovered from a latex and dispersed with moder ate shear in a non solvent for vinylidene chloride polymers, such as a polyol used in the preparation of polyurethane materials. A dispersion of the powder and a polyol is emi nently suited for use in the preparation of polyurethane foams to impart enhanced flame retardancy and load bearing properties thereto.
