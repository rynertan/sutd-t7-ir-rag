# Apparatus for vacuum deposition.

## Abstract
A system for vacuum depositing a material onto a sample 12 having a surface recess, such as a hole or channel, therein. The system includes a vacuum chamber capable of at taining a high vacuum and a vacuum deposition source 134 in the chamber for emitting atoms. An energy source 130 is connected to the vacuum deposition source 134 to initiate emission of the atoms therefrom. A sample 12 having an upper surface disposed in the vacuum chamber opposite the vacuum deposition source 134 is adapted to receive the at oms emitted from the vacuum deposition source 134 . The sample 12 has surface recesses 14 20 therein with walls 22 substantially perpendicular to the plane of the sample 12 . Finally, a component 146, 148 for eliminating undesir able depositing angles of atoms is disposed intermediate the vacuum deposition source 134 and the sample 12 in order to improve the ratio of recess wall to sample surface deposi tion. Another important feature of the component for eliminat ing undesirable depositing angles is its ability to reduce heat generated on the sample 12 during the deposition process.
