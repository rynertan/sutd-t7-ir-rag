## Abstract
The cap 16 comprises an inner cap 18 and an outer cap 20 . The inner cap 18 has an outer annular wall 24 defining a measuring chamber and an inner annular wall 26 spaced from the outer annular wall and joined to the outer annular wall by a bottom and closed by a planar surface 34 defining a downwardly opening activity 28 to be fitted over a neck 12 of a flexible wall container 10 . A conduit 36 extends through the planar surface 34 for permitting liquid flow into the measuring chamber. The outer cap 20 can rotate about the inner cap 18 and can slide up or down until a detent 50 on its sidewall 44 catches an outwardly projecting lip extending around the outer annular wall 24 of the inner cap 18 . The outer cap 20 has provided at least one opening through its sidewall 44 and further has a projection 48 attached to its top 46 and extending downwardly into the conduit 36 to fluid flow.
