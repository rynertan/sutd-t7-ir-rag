# Operator height adjustable cardholder.

## Abstract
An adjustable cardholder 10 which is moveable by means of an operator rotatable screw member 32 is disclosed. The operator may raise or lower the cardholder to present the guide lines 26 on the surface thereof at the point at which the bottom of the typed characters appear so that sheets 24 may be accurately reinserted or forms may be precisely aligned so that material typed will appear properly positioned.

## Claims
1. An adjustable cardholder for a typewriter, of the type comprising a member 10 conforming generally to the periphery of a platen 16 , and formed to define an aperture 20 therein to receive a print implement 22 for effecting printing, said cardholder being characterized in that it includes mounting means 18, 32 for adjustably supporting said cardholder proximate to said platen said mounting means comprising a pair of operator manipulatable screw members 32 supportedly engaged by a supporting member 12 and supportingly engaging a bracket means 18 attached to said cardholder said bracket means 18 engaging said screw members 32 to move relative to said supporting member 12 in a direction axially of said screw members 32 upon rotation of said screw members 32 to provide adjustment of said bracket means 18 and said cardholder relative to said supporting member 12 upon screw rotation.

## Description
This invention relates to typewriter cardholders and operator adjustable cardholders in particular. Cardholders on typewriters function to hold the record sheet against the platen in the region where the printing occurs and to thus prevent the typing element from striking the page when the record sheet is not backed by the platen, and before the record sheet is engaged by other paper restraints such as the paper bail. Additionally, the cardholder provides a member which may have guide lines thereon, thus serving as an aid to the positioning of the record sheet relative to the print line upon reinsertion of the sheet into the typewriter. Since the front surface of the cardholder is spaced from the platen surface, the guide lines on the front surface thereof will appear in a different position, relative to the platen, for operators of differing heights, due to differing eye levels. The relative position of the lines used as guides are a source of complaints from operators as the operators will have a tendency to misjudge the placement of the writing line as they reinsert the record sheet in the typewriter. Operator complaints result in service calls to adjust the cardholder for that specific operator. The cardholder appears to be out of adjustment by any operator whose eye level is different. Cardholders generally are only adjustable, if at all, by loosening a screw or similar fastener and repositioning the cardholder and then retightening the fastener, in a trial and error approach, and generally involves a tool and the aid of a service technician. A cardholder for a typewriter is supported upon the carrier of a moving carrier typewriter or upon the frame of a typewriter of the moving carriage type such that it will traverse the writing line in a fixed position relative to the printing element. The support for this cardholder is a pair of threaded screw members which carry thereon brackets which are attached to the cardholder. The screw members are provided with means to maintain the brackets in a fixed axial position relative to the screw members. The screw members are threadedly engaged in the carrier or frame and may be screwed into, or out of, the carrier to change the position of the brackets relative to the carrier. By changing the relative position of the cardholder to the carrier, the guide lines on the cardholders are shifted with respect to the print line and thus will appear differently to an operator. This allows different operators to have the same visual perception of the position of the print line relative to the guide line. It is an advantage of the invention that misalignment of the cardholder and the guidelines thereon with the print line are eliminated. It is another advantage of the invention that operator individualization of the cardholder position without the services of a service technician is provided. The shortcomings of the prior art are overcome and the advantages of the invention are accomplished as will be more fully understood by reference to the drawings and the detailed description of the invention to follow. Referring to Fig. 1, the cardholder 10 of the present invention is illustrated as mounted on the carrier 12 of a moving carrier typewriter. The carrier 12 is supported on shaft 14, which acts to define a travel path for the carrier 12 and which is parallel to the axis and periphery of platen 16, thereby defining a writing line along the platen. Cardholder 10 conforms to the periphery of platen 16 so as to position material against platen 16. The cardholder 10 is supported by two brackets 18 which are fixedly attached to the cardholder 10 in a conventional manner, such as riveting. The cardholder 10 is provided with an aperture 20 central to the cardholder 10 to permit the printing implement 22 to strike the record sheet 24 to effect printing. Closely associated with the aperture 20 and carried on the surface of the cardholder 10 may be guide lines 26 which the operator uses to align a paper or other record sheet 24 so that upon insertion, the print line will be properly aligned with previously typed text, blanks or position on a form. With reference to Fig. 2, which shows two different operator eye positions, the guide lines 26 are shown as viewed by the operator. The line of sight past guide lines 26 intersects the record sheet at two different positions, 29, 31, depending upon eye level position. If the operator positions the record sheet relative to the guide lines 26 by aligning the desired point the bottom of the character position on the record sheet 24, with the guide line 26 it can be seen that the point of alignment, with respect to the printing implement, is dependent on the eye position 28, 30 of the operator. For an operator having an eye position at 28, it is necessary for an adjustment to be made in the height of the guide line 26 by lowering the cardholder 10 to cause the operator s line of sight to pass guide lines 26 and intersect the record sheet at the same point as that of eye position 30. In order to make such adjustments, a pair of threaded screw members 32 support brackets 18. The screw members 32 are provided with a flange 34 axially fixed with respect to the screw member 32. The flange 34 acts to support bracket 18. The flange 34 may be, for example, a C clip engaged in a groove on the screw member 32 or may be formed permanently to screw member 32. A biasing force to urge bracket 18 into engagement with flange 34 is provided by spring 36 which is coiled about each screw member 32. The end of spring 36 remotely displaced from bracket 18 is engaged by a second flange 38. The screw member 32 is threadedly engaged with carrier 12 and may be moved axially by rotating the screw member 32, thus raising or lowering flange 34, which in turn raises or lowers bracket 18 and cardholder 10. To facilitate the rotation of the screw member 32, a knob 40 is provided on the top of screw member 32, whereby the operator may readily rotate the screw member 32 manually. The operator lowers or raises the cardholder 10 and guide lines 26 by screwing the screw member 32 into or out of the carrier 12. When a different person takes over operation of the typewriter, a record sheet may be typed with a series of characters and the cardholder 10 adjusted to position the guide line 26 at the base of the letters typed, by screwing the screw members 32 into or out of the carrier 12. Both the left and right screw members 32 need to be adjusted to assure that the guide lines 26 are maintained parallel to the writing line. The sheet 24 may be then removed and reinserted and a test character typed to check alignment. The operator may then make any further adjustment as perceived. By trial and error, the proper cardholder position may be determined. When still another operator assumes the operation of the typewriter, the cardholder 10 may then be readjusted to that operator s particular preference without the need for the services of a service technician. An alternate embodiment of the invention may involve the use of member 40 which is rotatably mounted on a carrier 12 as seen in Fig. 4 and which is threaded along its length. Bracket 18 is then likewise threaded at a lower opening 18a to accept the threads of member 40 and move axially of member 40 when member 40 is rotated about its axis. Although member 40 is axially fixed, the bracket 18 is moveable along member 40 to accomplish the raising and lowering of the cardholder 10. The opening 18b in the upper part of bracket 18 slides freely along member 40. The adjustable cardholder may be mounted on the frame of a moving carriage typewriter with the same benefits to the operator as those experienced by the operator of a moving carrier type typewriter. The cardholder may be made of a material which is transparent and thus provides visibility of the writing line when reinserting a record sheet into the typewriter. The cardholder need to be transparent and if not transparent, the guide lines 26 may be in the form of marks on the surface or slots formed in the material.
