# Transmission system for the transmission of binary data symbols.

## Abstract
Transmission system for bi phase modulated signals. Generally receiving filters for these signals will have a frequency response up to twice the bit frequency twice 1 T passband. For coloured noise whose power increases as the frequency increases this may mean a considerable deteriora tion of the signal to noise ratio compared with the signal to noise ratio for unmodulated NRZ signals. In order to increase the signal to noise ratio a receiving filter is used in this case, whose frequency response approximates zero above the bit frequency 1 T stopband and which for lower frequencies is determined such that after filtering a predominantly three level signal is obtained. The binary data signal can be derived from this signal by rectification and slicing. Use Optical communication systems.
