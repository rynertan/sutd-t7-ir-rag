# METHOD OF SEPARATING CARBONACEOUS COMPOUNDS FROM PARTICULATE COAL CONTAINING INORGANIC SOLIDS AND APPARATUS THEREFOR

## Abstract
Carbonaceous components are separated from particu late coal containing inorganic solids by agitating and aerating the coal, agglomerating oil and water to form agglomerates of carbonaceous components of the coal and oil with air trapped in the agglomerates. The air trapped in the agglomerates makes them buoyant so that they collect at the surface of the water, for easy removal, while inorganic residual solids col lect at the bottom of the water. The inorganic solids contain ing coal may originally be in the form of a slurry with the water or may comprise previously formed agglom erates which are broken down by the agitation to form a slurry . In the latter case the process is for removal of inorganic solids which were not removed during the initial agglomeration. The agitation may be accomplished by a stir rer 2 , impeller 16, 30 or a pump 54 .
