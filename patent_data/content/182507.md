## Description
This specification describes an invention relating to novel hetero polycyclic dyestuffs, methods for their preparation and their use in the colouration of textile materials. Dyes based on the 3,7 diphenyl 2,6 dioxo 2,6 dihydrobenzo 1 2 b, 4 5 b difuran chromophore and carrying a variety of different groups on the pendant 3 and 7 phenyl groups are known from EP 33583A, GB 2103231A and FR 2343785. According to the present invention there is provided a compound of the formula wherein, The optionally substituted hydrocarbon group represented by R⁵ is preferably C₁ ₈ alkyl, and more preferably C₁ ₄ alkyl, or monocyclic aryl, more preferably phenyl which may be substituted by groups selected from hydroxy, halogen, nitro and alkoxy. Where R⁵ is monocyclic aryl it may also be substituted by alkyl and where R⁵ is alkyl it may also be substituted. The acyl group represented by R⁵ is preferably C₁ ₄ alkyl or monocyclic aryl carbonyl or sulphonyl which may be substituted by one or more groups selected from hydroxy, halogen, nitro, C₁ ₄ alkyl and C₁ ₄ alkoxy. Examples of the optionally substituted hydrocarbon groups represented by R⁵ are alkyl and preferably C₁ ₄ alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, The aryl groups represented by X¹ and X² are preferably mono homocyclic aryl, that is phenyl and substituted phenyl. The C₁ ₄ alkyl and alkoxy groups represented by X¹ and X² may also be substituted and examples of suitable substituents for these and the aryl groups are hydroxy, halogen, nitro, C₁ ₄ alkyl and C₁ ₄ alkoxy. The carbamoyl and sulphamoyl groups represented by X¹ and X² are preferably of the formula CONL¹L² or SO₂NL¹L² wherein L¹ and L² are each independently hydrogen, C₁ ₄ alkyl or monocyclic aryl, preferably phenyl. The carboxylic acid ester groups represented by X¹ and X² are preferably of the formula COOL³ wherein L³ is optionally substituted alkyl, especially C₁ ₄ alkyl, or monocyclic aryl, especially phenyl. Benzene rings A and B are preferably different, the difference lying in the nature and or the number of substituents carried by each ring. The difference lies preferably in the identity of the groups R¹ to R⁴ and X Y carried by these rings. It is preferred that R¹ and R² are both H or both C₁ ₄ alkyl or that one is C₁ ₄ alkyl or alkoxy and the other is H and that the substituent is present in a para position. It is preferred that R³ and R⁴ are both H or both C₁ ₄ alkyl or that one is C₁ ₄ alkyl or C₁ ₄ alkoxy and the other is H and that the substituent is present in an ortho position with respect to the group X Y. It is preferred that X¹ and X² are both hydrogen and it is also preferred that Z¹ and Z² are both oxygen. Under these preferred circumstances the asymmetry in the compound of Formula I is provided by a difference in substitution on benzene rings A and B. It is preferred that ring A is unsubstituted, or carries a single alkyl or alkoxy group in the para position, and that ring B carries a single substituent represented by X Y. It is preferred that X is oxygen and it is further preferred that Y is C₃ or C₄ alkenyl. Examples of suitable groups represented by Y are allyl, beta methylallyl and n but 2 enyl. The compound of Formula I, wherein Z¹ and Z² are both oxygen, may be prepared by reaction of a 5 hydroxy 2 oxo 3 phenyl 2,3 dihydrobenzofuran of the formula in which X¹, X², R¹, R² and A have the same meaning as in Formula I, with a mandelic acid or derivative thereof, in which the 3 phenyl substituent of the dihydrobenzofuran and or the phenyl ring of the mandelic acid carry appropriate substituents, at least one of which is a group X Y in the 4 position, in an organic solvent at a temperature not exceeding 120 C in the presence of an acid catalyst and oxidising the product with a mild oxidising agent. A preferred process for the preparation of a compound of Formula I comprises the reaction of a compound of Formula IV with a mandelic acid or derivative thereof of the formula wherein X and Y have the same meanings as in Formula I and L is COOR⁶, CONR⁷R⁸ or CN, in which R⁶, R⁷ and R⁸ are each independently H or C₁ ₄ alkyl under the aforementioned conditions and oxidising the intermediate product to form a compound of Formula I.

The compound of Formula I in which X Y is OH may be prepared by reaction of 4 hydroxymandelic acid with a compound of Formula IV using a method giving in EP 33583A. Although saturated analogues of the present compound, i.e. compounds of Formula I except that X Y is alkoxy, are known from UK 1,568,231 and EP 33583A, it is not possible to prepare a dye of Formula I by the processes disclosed in these patents. A compound of Formula I is suitable for the coloration of synthetic textile materials, especially polyesters, giving bright orange to bluish red shade. It has a high extinction coefficient in the region of 450 to 550 nm and generally builds up well on the textile material to give a strong shade. It has good light fastness and very good vet and heat fastness properties. It is generally suitable for application by recognised dyeing and printing techniques for polyester textile materials. According to another feature of the present invention there is provided a process for the colouration of a synthetic textile material which comprises dyeing or printing the synthetic textile material with a dyebath liquor or a print paste containing an aqueous dispersion of a compound according to Formula I.
