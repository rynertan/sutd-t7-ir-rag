## Description
The present invention is in the field of film laminates more particularly, the invention relates to the use oforiented film laminates of polyamides and ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymers. Laminates containing at least one layer of ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer and at least onepolyamide, usually polyepsiloncaprolactam, layers of ethylene vinyl alcohol are disclosed in US A 3595740, 3949114, 4254169 and 4284678. The ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer layer provides a barrier tooxygen permeability. Polyamides are used for physical property improvement, chemical resistance, andacts as a barrier to gas permeability. US A 4294935 discloses that a film of ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer has improved gas barriercharacteristics when expanded to an area 4 to 20 times the original area. EP A 0063006 discloses composite films comprising a plasticized ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer,the plasticizer being an aromatic sulfonamide, polyethyl oxazoline, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyvinylformaldehyde or a polyamide. These can be formed into laminated structures with various film formingresins, such as polyamides, partially hydrolyzed ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer adhesives or anhydridemodified polyolefin adhesives. These laminates are stated to have excellent oxygen barrier properties andcan be partially stretched, for instance to wrap a food item, without developing pinholes, cracks etc. GB A 1522397 discloses heat shrinkable laminate film having low oxygen permeability comprising ahydrolyzed ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer disposed between two other polymeric layers, at least one ofwhich is crosslinked. The laminate is heated to the orientation temperature of the crosslinked polymer andstretched. The polymeric layers are preferably polyethylene or an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer. Otherpolymer layers. e.g. of polyamides, may be present, but are not specifically discussed. The stretching isindicated to be at least 10 in one direction in order to provide useful heat shrinking capabilities. The present invention provides use as an oxygen barrier of a film laminate comprising a polyamide layer, preferably polyepsiloncaprolactam,and a layer of ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer. According to the invention, the laminate isexpanded to an area of up to 4 times its original area by monoaxially drawing it to a draw ratio of from 1.5 1 to 4 1.Preferably, the polyamide and the ethylene vinyl alcohol layers are adjacent 10 oneanother. Preferred laminates have outer layers of polyepsiloncaprolactam and at least one inner layer ofethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer adjacent to at least one layer of polyepsiloncaprolactam. Preferably, thelaminate is a multilayer coextrusion. The degree of orientation or drawing of the film laminate is characterised bythe draw ratio. For the purposes of the present invention the term draw ratio is an indication of the increasein the dimension in the direction of draw. Therefore the film laminate having a draw ratio of 2 1 has itslength doubled during the drawing or orientation process. In the present invention the film laminate ismonoaxially drawn to a draw ratio of from 1.5 1 to 4 1.The film laminate increases in area upon being drawn. The expansionof area is an indication of how much the film has been stretched. The film laminate of the present inventioncan be stretched so that the area of the film has expanded to an area up to 4 times the original area. Thisresults in dramatic improvements in barrier properties, as indicated by the examples. As discussed below the film laminate can be formed by various processesincluding coextrusion and extrusion lamination. The preferred film laminate is formed by coextrusion. The preferred structure of the film laminate of the present invention is one in which there is at least onelayer of ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer adjacent to at least one layer of polyamide, preferablypolyepsiloncaprolactam.

It is recognized that the blend can include other compatible polymers. In a preferred method for improving the barrier properties of the film laminate at least one layer ofpolyamide is laminated adjacent to at least one layer of ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer and the laminateis then monoaxially oriented. The film laminate can be formed by suitable laminating techniquesincluding extrusion lamination and coextrusion. In the most preferred method the laminating is conductedby coextrusion. Processes of coextrusion to form film and sheet laminates are generally known as indicatedin, Modern Plastics Encyclopedia , Vol. 56, No. 10A, pp. 131 132, McGraw Hill, October, 1979.Coextruded sheet and film are made using multimanifold dies such as a multi manifold circular die forbubble blown film or coextrusion feed block combined with a flat die for cast film. The article Trends Equipment...Co extrusion by M. H. Naitove in Plastics Technology, February, 1977, pp. 61 71, discussesco extrusion in further detail. As indicated above it is preferred to orient the film laminate after forming the laminate. The filmlaminate used in the present invention has been found to be able to be oriented without delaminating orfibrillating.The orientation can be conducted by methods knownin the art. Generally, monoaxially oriented film is prepared by passing the film over a series of preheatingand heating rolls. The heated film laminate moves through a set of nip rolls downstream at a faster rate than the film entering the nip rolls at an upstream location. The change of rate is compensated for bystretching in the film laminate. Typical process and range of conditions for monoaxially oriented polyamidefilm are disclosed in US A 4362585.The film laminate used in the present invention can beembossed after orientation. The film laminate used in the present invention having at least one polyamide layer and at least one layer ofethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer has improved gas particularly oxygen barrierproperties contributed by the layers of polyamide and ethylene vinyl alcohol than would be expected fromseparate films of oriented polyamide and oriented ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer.
