# Exercise weight.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to an exercise weight 10 which has an aperture extending therethrough which is defined by an inner wall 14 . The weight includes a locating flange 16 extending inwardly of the inner wall. A resilient bushing 24 of low friction material is inserted into the aperture of the weight and is slidably engageable with an elongate rod. The bushing has a peripheral wall and two locking flanges 30, 34 at the top and bottom of the peripheral wall which engage the locating flange 16 to preclude movement of the bushing relative to the weight in first and second opposing directions parallel to the longitu dinal axis of the rod.
