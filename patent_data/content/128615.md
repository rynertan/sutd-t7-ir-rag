# Charge coupled semiconductor device and image sensor device of high information density.

## Abstract
In a CCD, especially in an image sensing device 1 , the electrodes of the sensor part 2 and the memory part 3 can be switched between a reference level and a clock pulse. As a result, the information density and hence in the image sensor device the number of image lines to be read out independently can be double. Thus, the resolution is im proved, while moreover the possibility is obtained for ex ample, for an electronic photocamera to record even and odd lines simultaneously.
