# Process for recovering oil from subterranean oil bearing formations and an emulsion useful therein.

## Abstract
The present invention provides a process for recover ing oil from subterranean oil bearing formations by intro ducing through a well bore into such formations a stable, aqueous flooding medium comprising an acrylamide am monium acrylate copolymer having a molecular weight above about one million. Superior flow properties leading to enhanced oil recovery are attainable by the process of the invention.
