# Improved zinc phosphating method.

## Abstract
A method for enhancing the corrosion resistance of a metal surface at the edge portion which comprises applying direct current to said metal surface as previously zinc phosphated as a negative electrode in an acidic solution comprising zinc ion in a concentration of 2 to 3 g L, phosphate ion in a concentration of 8 to 14 g L and chloride ion in a concentration of 3 to 6 g L under the condition of 5 to 15 A dmÂ² metal surface at a temperature of 20 to 40 C to make an electric zinc phosphate coating film having corro sion resistance.
