# Recovering hydrogen from gas stream using metal hydride.

## Abstract
This invention relates to an improved adiabatic process for separating hydrogen from mixed gas streams using hydridable materials as the absorbing medium. The im provement comprises utilizing a composite comprising a thermal ballast in admixture with the hydride material to absorb the heat of reaction and to aid in desorption. By virtue of the intimate contact of the ballast with the hydridable material rapid cycle times plus good bed utilization are achieved.
