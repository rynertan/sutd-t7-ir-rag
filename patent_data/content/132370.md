# Apparatus for measuring optical transmission factor.

## Abstract
The optical transmission factor of an object A is measured by mutual measuring technology using a pair of identical units 44, 50 located on opposite sides of the object. Each of the units 44, 50 comprises a pair of beam splitters 47, 48 53, 54 , a light source 45, 46 51, 52 for illuminating the object through a first beam splitter 47 and providing an offset beam 56 from the first beam splitter 47 , and a photo detector 49,55 for converting optical power from the other unit 50 and the offset beam 56 . Each of the beam splitters 47, 48 53, 54 is substantially in parallelogram shape with two pairs of confronting planes 24, 25 and 22, 23 , a first pair of the planes 24, 25 being not perpendicular to the second pair of planes 22, 23 . One of the first pair of planes 24 is mirror coated for reflecting the beam internally, such that split beams 29, 31 obtained from a single beam 27 share a common point 200 on the plane 23 . Thus, dust and dirt free measurement using no mechanically moving means is accomplished.
