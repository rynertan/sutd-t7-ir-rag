## Description
The present invention relates to a method of and apparatus for assembling block shaped commodities according to the preambles of the claims 1 and 14 respectively. It is known to accumulate wrapped reams of paper sheets into piles or stacks and to introduce the thus obtained piles into receptacles. It is also known to build receptacles around piles of reams of paper sheets. An apparatus as so called wraparound case packer of such type is manufactured and sold by the applicant of the present application and is known as Model 86. A drawback of presently known apparatus for the confinement of piles or stacks of paper sheets is that their operation is too slow if they are to turn out boxes or analogous receptacles of prescribed size and or shape and or quality. Furthermore, the versatility of heretofore known apparatus is insufficient, i.e., these apparatus cannot be converted for the making of widely different products including boxes which contain predetermined numbers of wrapped reams consisting of smaller or larger sheets and or reams which are assembled into a single row or several rows. Furthermore, presently known apparatus are rather bulky and all of their parts are not readily accessible. One method of and apparatus for assembling block shaped commodities described in the preamble of the description are known from US A 4 480 422. There is described an apparatus for wrapping stacks of paper sheets in such a way thath each stack is transported in one and the same plane in the course of the entire wrapping operation. This operation is provided for the packing of stacks of specific commodities, namely relatively large and unstable stacks of paper sheets which are to be sandwiched between the upper and lower blanks while such blanks are subjected to the required folding steps. This known operation mode is relatively slow so that the output of the respective apparatus is not very high. It may be very suitable for the packing of the said specific commodities but it does not meet the requirements of modern high speed operation of packing of standard commodities. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a novel and improved method of confining arrays of paper sheets or the like in receptacles in a continuous operation so that large numbers of arrays can be boxed per unit of time. Another object of the invention is to provide a method which renders it possible to provide arrays of paper sheets e.g., arrays of six stacks of paper sheets each with receptacles in a time and space saving operation and without contamination of and or other damage to the arrays, A further object of the invention is to provide a method which can be used to introduce into each receptacle a single array or a plurality of arrays of properly oriented sheet like articles. An additional object of the invention is to provide a method which can be automated to the desired extent and which can be utilized for the processing of small, large, medium sized, stiff, soft, pressure sensitive, unicolored, multicolored, thick and or thin sheets of paper, synthetic plastic material or the like. Still another object of the invention is to provide a method which ensures that the orientation of processed sheets is not changed at all or is changed only negligibly and or infrequently to thus further reduce the likelihood of misorientation of sheets during introduction into and confinement in cardboard boxes or the like. A further object of the invention is to provide a novel and improved apparatus for the practice of the above outlined method and to construct and assemble the apparatus in such a way that the apparatus can turn out large numbers of boxed commodities per unit of time. Another object of the invention is to provide an apparatus wherein the commodities are boxed or packed while in continuous or substantially continuous motion so that the intervals of idleness are a fraction of those in conventional indexing apparatus. A further object of the invention is to provide an apparatus which can process a wide variety of sheet like commodities with the same degree of accuracy, facility and reproducibility. Still another object of the invention is to provide an apparatus which can be used in production lines for the processing of sheet like products as a superior substitute for heretofore known case packers. An additional object of the invention is to provide the apparatus with novel and improved means for converting cardboard blanks or the like into receptacles for single or multiple arrays of stacked paper sheets or the like. A further object of the invention is to provide the above outlined apparatus with novel and improved means for transporting successive arrays through a series of successive stations where the arrays are gradually confined in one piece or composite receptacles consisting of cardboard or the like. Another object of the invention is to provide the apparatus with novel and improved means for storing and feeding blanks of cardboard or the like to various stations where such blanks are draped around arrays of stacked paper sheets or analogous commodities. One feature of the invention resides in the provision of a method of assembling commodities with components of confining means therefor, particularly of confining arrays of paper stacks in converted blanks which are made of cardboard or the like. The improvement of the method described in the preamble of claim 1 is characterised in that successive commodities are transported to the said predetermined position into register with the said first components at a first level, successive commodities and the respective first components are jointly moved to a second level and said converting step takes place at said second level, the second components, the respective commodities and the first receptacles are jointly moved to a third level and conversion of the second components into the second receptacles takes place at the third level, and in that the second components, the respective commmodities and the respective first receptacles are moved from the second to the third level while simultaneously moving in the predetermined direction. The method can further comprise the step of guiding successive commodities in the course of the transporting step so that each such commodity is transported to the same predetermined position. The conveying step can include changing the orientation of successive first components such as the aforementioned cardboard blanks during conveying toward the positions of register with the respective commodities. This can contribute to compactness of the apparatus which is used to practice the improved method. For example, the conveying step can include changing the orientation of successive first components through between 75 and 105 degrees, including moving each first component from a substantially vertical plane into a substantially horizontal plane. Such conveying step can further include moving successive first components in the horizontal plane toward the positions of register with the respective commodities. The second advancing step can include uninterruptedly advancing the commodities, the respective first receptacles and the respective second components along the second path. The third level can be above the second level and the first level can be above the second level. At least one of the first and second paths is preferably at least substantially horizontal. The method can further comprise the step of bonding each second receptacle to the corresponding first receptacle. The second conveying step can include changing the orientation of successive second components during conveying toward the predetermined portion of the first path this can enhance the compactness of the apparatus which is used to practice the method. For example, the second conveying step can include changing the orientation of successive second components through approximately or exactly 90 degrees, including moving each second component from a substantially vertical plane into a substantially horizontal plane. Such second conveying step can further include moving successive second components in the horizontal plane toward a predetermined portion of the first path. Another feature of the invention resides in the provision of an apparatus for assembling commodities with components of confining means therefor, particularly for confining arrays of paper stacks in converted blanks of cardboard or the like. The moving means can comprise means for lowering successive commodities and the respective first components from the first to the second level, and the first path is or can be at least substantially horizontal. The apparatus can further comprise guide means cooperating with the transporting means to ensure that each of a short or long series of commodities is transported to the same predetermined position. The converting means can include a portion which is adjacent to the moving means so that a portion of each first component is converted into a portion of the respective first receptacle during movement with the respective commodity from the first to the second level. The advancing means can comprise means for continuously advancing successive commodities and the respective first components along the first path. The conveying means can comprise means for changing the orientation of successive first components on their way toward positions of register with the respective commodities in the predetermined position. Such orientation changing means can comprise means for moving successive first components of the series from a substantially vertical plane into a substantially horizontal plane, and the conveying means preferably further comprises means for conveying successive first components in the horizontal plane toward positions of register with the respective commodities in the predetermined positions. The conveying means can comprise means for placing successive first components of the aforementioned series below the respective commodities in the predetermined position. The means for advancing second components, the corresponding first receptacles and the corresponding commodities along the second path preferably includes means for uninterruptedly advancing successive second components, the corresponding first receptacles and the respective commodities along the second path. The second path is or can be at least substantially horizontal. The means for converting the second components into second receptacles preferably comprises a portion which is adjacent to the means for moving successive second components from the second level to the third level so that a portion of each second component is converted into a portion of the respective second receptacle during movement with the respective commodity and first receptacle from the second level to the third level. The means for conveying a series of second components to a predetermined position in a predetermined portion of the first path downstream of the first converting means preferably comprises means for changing the orientation of second components on their way toward the predetermined portion of the first path, and such orientation changing means preferably comprises means for moving successive second components from a substantially vertical plane into a substantially horizontal plane. The just discussed conveying means preferably further comprises means for conveying successive second components in the horizontal plane toward and into the predetermined portion of the first path. Such conveying means can comprise means for placing successive second components of the respective series on top of the corresponding commodities in the predetermined portion of the first path. The apparatus can further comprise means for bonding each second receptacle to the respective first receptacle. Still further, the apparatus can comprise a source of supply of commodities and means for singularizing the commodities of the respective series between the source and the predetermined position. One important advantage of the invention resides in that it avoids complete stoppage of the stacks prior to transfer to the third level and contributes to a higher output and a reduction of noise generation. Another advantage of the invention consists in the versatility of the improved method and apparatus. The invention renders it possible to provide one or more arrays of paper sheets, e.g. arrays of six stacks, with receptacles. The improved method and apparatus can be utilized for the processing of any kind and type of paper sheets, synthetic plastic material or the like. Further advantages of the invention will be seen from the following description of a preferred embodiment for a machine according to the invention. Referring first to Fig. 1, there is shown a container in the form of a box 1 which includes a lower receptacle or case 2 and an upper receptacle or lid 3. The downwardly extending flaps 4 of the lid 3 are bonded to the adjacent folded flaps 4 by a suitable adhesive. The case 2 may but normally need not be bonded to the lid 2. The box 1 contains a single array or pile 9 of commodities in the form of stacks 6, and each such stack consists of a given number of overlapping paper sheets confined in a paper wrapper 7. The box 1 can be designed to accommodate several e.g., two piles of stacks 6 side by side. This depends on the dimensions of stacks 6 and on the desired dimensions of the box. The stacks 6 can be accumulated into piles, which are ready for boxing, in a suitable ream stacker accumulator such as the Model 134 or 135, both manufactured and sold by the assignee of the present application which constitutes a source of supply of piles. The basic mode of operation of one presently preferred embodiment of the improved apparatus is shown in Fig. 2. The ream stacker accumulator 8 discharges a row of aligned piles 9 each of which contains a predetermined number e.g., five of superimposed stacks 6. The piles 9 are singularized during advancement along a horizontal path note the arrow 30 , and successive singularized piles 9 reach a predetermined position 9 at a first level which is or can be the level of the row of piles 9 issuing from the stacker accumulator 8. Of course, it is also possible to place the stacker accumulator 8 at a different level and to move the piles 9 up or down before they reach the level of the pile which assumes the predetermined position 9 at a station 29. Such pile is then located on top of a component 10 of confining means for the respective pile, namely on a blank which is made of cardboard, corrugated paper or the like and is cut to size as well as provided with fold lines and slits to facilitate its conversion into a case 2. The blank 10 is withdrawn from a first hopper 11 which is laterally adjacent to the path of movement of piles 9 from the stacker accumulator 8 toward the discharge or outlet end of the apparatus. The piles 9 advance in a single plane and are caused to move in such plane up and down but not sideways. This is desirable and advantageous because the stacks 6 of a pile are less likely to shift and also because the width of the apparatus can be reduced accordingly. The hopper 11 contains a supply of neighboring blanks 10 which are disposed in substantially vertical planes. Successive foremost blanks 10 are or can be lifted in their planes at an angle to the vertical arrows 12 , turned through an angle normally not exceeding 90 degrees e.g., 80 degrees into a horizontal plane arrows 13 and moved arrows 14 transversely of the direction of advancement of the piles 9 to a predetermined position below the pile 9 which occupies the position 9 at the station 29. Such pile then overlies the central portion of the blank 10 therebelow, namely the portion which is to constitute the bottom panel of the case 2. The stacker accumulator 8 and or the improved apparatus is provided with guide means not shown in Fig. 2 serving to ensure that each of a short or long series of successive piles 9 is caused to assume the same predetermined position 9 , namely an optimum position of register with the respective blank 10. The pile 9 in the position 9 and the blank 10 therebelow are then caused to move to a different level, namely downwardly as indicated by the arrow 15 and, at the same time, the front and rear panels of the descending blank 10 are folded upwardly against the respective front and rear sides of the descending pile 9 so as to form the corresponding front and rear sidewalls 5 of the incipient case 2. This is indicated by the arrows 16. The partially converted blank 10a and the respective pile 9 then advance along an elongated horizontal path arrows 17 in the same direction as that indicated by the arrow 30 but at a different lower level. The advancement of the blank 10a and of the pile 9 in the direction which is indicated by the arrows 17 is continuous rather than stepwise or intermittent , and the blank 10a is acted upon by a variety of folding and tucking instrumentalities which convert it see the arrows 16a and 16b first into a blank 10b with partially completed lateral sidewalls and thereupon into a case 2 with completed lateral sidewalls 5 each lateral sidewall includes two complanar inner panels which directly abut against or are directly adjacent to the respective lateral side of the confined pile 9 and an outer panel which overlies and is bonded to the respective inner panels to ensure that the resulting case 2 retains its shape . The case 2 and its contents pile 9 advance into a predetermined portion of their common path at a station 18 and to a position of accurate register with a second prefabricated blank 19 whose material can be the same as that of the blanks 10 which is withdrawn from a hopper 20 in the same way as described in connection with the blanks 10 and hopper 11. Thus, the blanks 19 in the hopper 20 are located in substantially vertical planes they are thereupon shifted partly upwardly and partly sideways as indicated by the arrows 21 they are thereupon caused to change their orientation through an angle normally not exceeding 90 degrees arrows 22 , e.g., 80 degrees, and are advanced arrow 23 at right angles to the direction of travel of piles 9 and associated blanks 10a, 10b and cases 2 arrows 17 to positions of exact overlap with the piles 9 arriving at the station 18. In the next step, the case 2 which has arrived at the station 18 is moved to a different level arrow 24 , namely to a higher level which may but need not be the level of the piles 9 advancing from the stacker accumulator 8 toward positions of register with successive blanks 10. At the same time, the front and rear flaps 4 of the blank 10 on top of the ascending pile 9 and case 2 are folded over the respective front and rear sidewalls 5 of the case 2. This is indicated by the arrows 25. The next step involves advancement of the case 2, of the pile 9 therein and of the respective partially converted blank 19a along a second elongated horizontal path arrows 26 which is parallel to and is disposed at a level above the path denoted by the arrows 17. The partially converted blank 19a is subjected to additional treatments by a series of suitably configurated folding and tucking instrumentalities which fold the end portions of the front and rear flaps 4 against the outer sides of the respective lateral sidewalls 5 of the case 2 arrows 27 to convert the blank 19a into a blank 19b, and the blank 19b is thereupon converted into a lid 3 in that its lateral flaps 4 are folded downwardly see the arrows 28 over the respective end portions of the front and rear flaps 4 and are bonded to the front and rear flaps by means of a suitable adhesive. The finished container or box 1 which contains a pile 9 of five stacks 6 is then evacuated from the apparatus, e.g., by one or more belt conveyors which can deliver boxes 1 into or onto a vehicle, to a further processing station e.g., to a station where the boxes 1 are provided with straps or the like or to storage. In the presently preferred embodiment of the improved apparatus, the elevator 52 Fig. 6C which serves to lift successive cases 2 above and away from the station 18 is constructed and mounted in such a way that successive cases 2 which arrive at the station 18 are not brought to a full stop but continue to advance in the direction of arrows 17 while simultaneously moving from the level of the station 18 to the level of the partially converted blank 19a shown in Fig. 2. Such composite partially upward and partially forward movement of the cases 2 and blanks 19 is effected by the elevator 52 jointly with an endless belt or chain conveyor 33 see Fig. 4 which has a set of motion transmitting fingers 33a serving to push successive cases 2 in the direction of the arrows 17 while the elevator 52 lifts such cases to the higher level. The just described composite movement of cases 2 with the elevator is indicated in Fig. 2 by the slight inclination of the arrow 24. By way of example, a case 2 on the elevator 52 can cover a distance of less than 20 inches e.g., approximately 10 inches while advancing in the direction which is indicated by the arrows 17 and while simultaneously moving from the level of the station 18 to the level of the partially converted blank 19a shown in Fig. 2. The just discussed absence of complete stoppage of successive cases 2 and their contents at the station 18 and or of a very pronounced reduction of the speed of forward movement of the cases 2 in the direction which is indicated by the arrows 17 has been found to contribute significantly to an increased output of the improved apparatus and to a pronounced reduction of noise. The apparatus of Fig. 2 can be modified by locating the station 29 for the pile 9 which assumes the predetermined position 9 at a level below the path which is indicated by the arrows 17 and or by locating the station 18 at a level above the path which is denoted by the arrows 26. Moreover, successive second blanks 19 can reach the path of the blanks 10 and the respective piles 9 ahead of the station 18, i.e., ahead of the locus where the finished cases 2, the piles 9 therein and the respective second blanks 19 are caused to move from the level of the station 18 to a different level above or below such station. Analogously, successive piles 9 arriving from the stacker accumulator 8 can be caused to overlie the respective blanks 10 ahead of the station 29 where the blanks 10 and the respective piles 9 descend arrow 15 in Fig. 2 . The feature that successive second blanks 19 can be moved to positions of register with the oncoming piles 9 ahead of the station 18 is shown in Figs. 2A, 3 and 4. It will be seen that a fresh unde formed blank 19 reaches the horizontal path of the respective pile 9 and associated converted blank 10b case 2 before such pile reaches the station 18, and the blank 19 then advances with the associated case 2 and pile 9 in the direction indicated by arrows 17 toward the station 18 before the case 2 and the pile 9 therein are lifted as indicated by the arrow 24. Fig. 3 further shows two singularizing conveyors 31 with pushers 32 which serve to deliver successive discrete piles 9 to the station 29 where such piles assume the positions 9 for accuarate registry with the oncoming blanks 10. Fig. 4 shows the continuously driven conveyor 33 which serves to advance successive lowered piles 9 and the corresponding blanks 10a, 10b and cases 2 along the horizontal path arrow 17 . The conveyor 33 has pushers 33a which advance the blanks 10a, 10b and the cases 2 along the path which is denoted by arrows 17 as well as along the path which is denoted by arrows 26. Fig. 4 shows quite clearly that the piles 9 remain in a single vertical plane during movement from the stacker accumulator 8 all the way to the outlet of the apparatus. This contributes to compactness of the apparatus. The details of the first hopper 11 for the case blanks 10 are shown in Figs. 11, 12 and 13. This hopper comprises a sloping ramp 34 of adjustable width which supports a supply of blanks 10 in vertical or nearly vertical planes. The foremost blank 10 of the supply on the ramp 34 abuts against a stop 35 which engages only the lateral flaps of such foremost blank so that the latter can be extracted by a pair of suction cups 36 which are movable along an arcuate path by an actuating mechanism 37 so as to change the orientation of the engaged blank 10 note the arrows 13 and to deliver the blank onto the upper reaches of two spaced apart endless belt conveyors 38 whereon the thus reoriented blank 10 advances along a substantially horizontal path arrows 14 and on to the station 29. The discharge ends of the upper reaches of the belt conveyors 38 cooperate with pinching rolls 39 which ensure predictable delivery of successive blanks 10 to the station 29, i.e., to optimum positions with reference to successive piles 9 which assume the positions 9 prior to descent with a first or front platform or elevator 41 Fig. 6A . The last stage of advancement of successive blanks 10 to the station 29 is controlled by guide rails 40 see Fig. 7A . The means for moving the platform 41 up and down is shown in Fig. 6A. Such moving means comprises a lifting arm 42 which is pivotable by a mechanism 43 to move the platform between the solid line lower end position and the phantom line upper end position 41 of Fig. 6A. The lifted platform 41 descends with the blank 10 and a pile 9 thereon whereby two stationary folding arms not specifically shown which are adjacent to the path of downward movement of the platform 41 fold the front and rear sidewalls 5 of the descending blank 10 upwardly arrows 16 in Fig. 2 so as to convert the blank 10 into the modified blank 10a not later than when the platform 41 reaches its lower end position. At such time, two pivotable tuckers 44 Fig. 10 pivot the end portions of the rear sidewall 5 forwardly and, shortly or immediately thereafter when the blank 10a begins to move in the direction of arrows 17 shown in Fig. 2 , the lateral end portions of the front sidewall 5 of the blank 10a are folded rearwardly note the arrows 16a in Fig. 2 by two stationary tucking rails 45. The tucking fingers 44 are mounted in the frame 46 of the apparatus on mobile carriers 47. All this can be best seen in Fig. 10. The platform 41 deposits the blank 10a and the pile 9 on the horizontal conveyor 33 whose pushers 33a advance the blank 10a past the stationary tucking rails 45 and into the range of pairs of pivotable folding plates 49, 50 which are hinged at 48 and convert successive blanks 10b into cases 2. Two of the folding plates 49, 50 at one side of the path which is defined by the conveyor 33 are shown in Fig. 6B. The pushers 33a of the conveyor 33 ensure predictable transport of the case 2 and the pile 9 therein onto the second platform or elevator 52 which is shown in Fig. 6C. The platform 52 is mounted on links 51 and is movable up and down by a mechanism 53 so that the platform 52 can raise the case 2 thereon to a level above the conveyor 33 where the case 2 can advance along a horizontal track 54 under the action of the pushers 33a. The pile 9 in the case 2 which is being lifted by the second platform 52 then receives or is already overlapped by a blank 19 which is supplied by the respective hopper 20 in the same way as described in connection with FIGS. 11 to 13. FIg. 7B shows the guide rails 55 for the blanks 19 which are being transported to the station 18 of Fig. 2 or to a station immediately ahead of the station 18. A series of overhead folding members 76 on a conveyor 75 shown in Fig. 4 fold the front and rear flaps 4 of the blank 19 downwardly arrows 25 in Fig. 2 while the platform 52 rises to the position of Fig. 6C so that the originally flat or nearly flat blank 19 is converted into the blank 19a. In the next step, and while the case 2 advances along the track 54, two turnable substantially L shaped tucking fingers 56 Figs. 6C and 8B fold the lateral end portions of the rear flap 4 of the blank 19a, and two stationary tucking rails 57 Figs. 6C and 8B fold the lateral end portions of the front flap 4 of the blank 19 so that the latter is converted into the blank 19b. In the next step, pairs of pivotable folding plates 58, 59 two shown in Fig. 6C fold down the lateral flaps 4 of the blank 19b so that such blank is converted into a finished upper receptacle or lid 3. Strips or patches of suitable adhesive preferably a hotmelt are applied to the lateral end portions of the upturned sidewalls 5 of successive blanks 10a as well as to the inner sides of the lateral sidewalls 5 of such blanks so as to ensure that the cases 2 will retain their shapes, i.e., that the lateral sidewalls 5 will reliably adhere to the adjacent outer sides of the respective end portions of the front and rear sidewalls 5. The same holds true for the lateral end portions of the front and rear flaps 4 and for the inner sides of the lateral flaps 4 of the lids 2, i.e., such parts are also coated with ahdesive to thus ensure that the respective lids will retain their shape. The flaps 4 need not and normally are not bonded to the upper portions of the respective sidewalls 5 of the case 2. Lateral conveyors 60 Figs. 6B and 7B are provided to prevent opening of the cases 2 during travel toward the second platform 52. These conveyors can bear against the lateral sidewalls 5 of the cases 2 with a variable force to thus ensure that the adhesive can set before the respective cases begin to move to a higher level. Analogous lateral conveyors 61 Figs. 6D and 8C are provided to prevent opening up of the lids 3 during transport toward the discharge end or outlet of the apparatus. The pressure with which the lateral conveyors 61 bear against the adjacent lateral flaps 4 of successive lids 3 is also adjustable to account for differences in the rigidity of the material of the blanks 19, for the nature of selected adhesive and or other variables. The effective width of the improved apparatus is adjustable so that it can accept wider or narrower piles or that it can accept two piles next to each other. Fig. 8B shows, by way of example, the manner in which the width of the path for advancement of cases 2 with piles 9 therein from the second elevator 52 to the box evacuating station of the apparatus can be altered by means of a handwheel 62, two feed screws 63 which mate with nuts 64 in the adjustable portion of the track for the cases 2, and a transmission 65 between the two feed screws. Adjustment of the mobile part 66 of the track for the cases 2 entails a corresponding adjustment of the tucking instrumentalities 56, 57 at the respective side of the apparatus. The height of the path for the piles 9 or pairs of piles 9 is also adjustable. This is shown schematically in Fig. 5 wherein an air motor 67 can change the level of certain constituents of the apparatus in order to account for changes in the height of piles. The width of the hoppers 11 and 20 is adjustable so that such hoppers can receive larger or smaller, wider or narrower blanks 10 and 19. Fig. 11 shows a handwheel 68 which can be manipulated to change the effective width of the magazine for storage of a supply of blanks 10 which are held in substantially vertical planes and which can advance toward the stop 35 of Fig. 12 under the action of a pusher or by gravity feed. Fig. 4A shows the main prime mover M of the apparatus, the main shaft 69, the main cams 70, a manual machine cycle handwheel 71 and several floor conveyors 71 for the piles 9 which advance from the ream stacker accumulator 8 toward the station 29. A clutch 73 is interposed between the output element of the prime mover M and the conveyor 33 which advances the product and the blanks along the paths indicated by the arrows 17 and 26. The floor conveyors 72 cooperate with the aforementioned conveyors 31, pushers 32 and adjustable guides 74 Fig. 9 to align, square and transfer the piles 9 onto the blanks 10 at the station 29. The apparatus is preferably further equipped with an enclosed pressurized hot glue melt system and with an operator control panel with programmable logic controller. For example, the hot melt applicator such as Nordson Model 2000 can be installed between the hoppers 11 and 20 so that it is readily accessible at all times. The main electrical control panel can be mounted on the frame between the hopper 20 and the discharge or outlet end of the apparatus. An auxiliary control panel can be mounted on the frame adjacent to the inlet end, and an emergency stop button can be installed at each end of the apparatus. Furthermore, several warning lights such as a low blank warning light and a machine fault warning light can be installed on top of the frame. A machine timing dial is preferably installed behind a door adjacent to the handwheel 71. Numerous additional handwheels such as a lidder conveyor phasing handwheel, a lidder width adjustment handwheel, a case compression height adjustment handwheel a case conveyor width adjustment handwheel, additional conveyor and pusher phasing handwheel, a product backstop adjustment handwheel, a product stop gate and indexer adjustment handwheel, and a conveyor reset safety clutch handwheel are preferably mounted and are accessible at that side of the frame which faces away from the two hoppers. If the operator desires to switch from casing and lidding of single stacks or piles of reams 6 to confinement of twin stacks or piles, the illustrated platforms 41 and 52 are replaced with wider platforms. Each of the platforms 41, 52 is preferably secured to its support by means of several screws or bolts so that the replacement of platforms takes up little time. The extent to which the operation can be automated can be selected practically at will. The various limit switches, photoelectrical detectors, mechanical sensors and or other signal generating monitoring devices for the electrical, hydraulic and or pneumatic systems of the apparatus are not specifically shown in Figs. 1 to 13. The apparatus is preferably further provided with automatic decelerating and arresting means for all such parts which fail to operate properly or are likely to deface and or otherwise damage the product. As explained above, the conveyor 33 which transports the blanks 10a, 10b and cases 2 in the directions indicated in Fig. 2 by arrows 17, and which advances the cases 2 in the directions indicated in Fig. 2 by arrows 26 operates continuously to thus contribute to a higher output of the apparatus and to reduce the wear upon its parts.
