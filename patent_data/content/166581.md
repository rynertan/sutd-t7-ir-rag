# Cmos circuit overvoltage protection.

## Abstract
The novel circuit 10 in accordance with the present invention uses vertical bipolar transistors 84, 80 to carry the overvoltage surge current. The transistors 84, 80 are controlled by a voltage sensing 16 30 and driving arrangement 40 78, 86 which includes means 86 for latching the current carry bipolar transistors in their conducting state during the cause of the surge. The structure of the vertical bipolar transistors is such that they can be readily incorporated on a CMOS integrated circuit. The transistors of the sensing, latching and driving circuits can than conventiently be in the form of MOS devices and thereby can be provided with better accuracy it and in a reduced circuit area.
