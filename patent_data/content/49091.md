# Method and apparatus for removal of meat from poultry limbs.

## Abstract
A small poultry limb 25 , such as a turkey drumstick, is clamped to a longitudinally movable ram 3 . The limb 25 is thrust by the ram 3 through a first resiliently flexible stripping device 5 and a second stripping device 7 . The bone 28 passes through the stripping devices but the skin 29 and ten dons clamped to the ram 3 are held and turned back over the ram thus exposing the meat for stripping.
