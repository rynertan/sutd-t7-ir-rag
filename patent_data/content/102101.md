# Pyroelectric infra red radiation detector.

## Abstract
A low microphonic infra red radiation detector, for ex ample, for an intruder alarm, has a pyroelectric element 1 comprising a pyroelectric body sandwiched between two electrodes 3a,3b . The element 1 is supported above a header 5 by two leads 9,12 of a microminiature package 13 which is mounted on its back on the header. One lead 9 is electrically connected to the element whereas the other 12 is insulated from it. A second pyroelectric element 2 may similarly be supported by two leads 10,11 of the package.
