# Laser light sources.

## Abstract
A light source comprises a semiconductor laser 14 and a gas laser 10 . The semiconductor laser 14 is injection locked using the highly coherent output from the gas laser. The output from the semiconductor laser has a narrow linewidth and a high stability. The invention has a major application in optical fibre communications systems.
