# Sod harvesting machine.

## Abstract
A sod harvesting machine 10 which travels forwardly along a path of travel has a sod cutting head 16 pivotally con nected to a fixed rear frame 20 by a horizontal front pivot shaft 80 having its axis 82 aligned along the path of travel and located close to the ground, and by a pair of rear pivots 84 92 . The rear pivots 84 92 are formed by a pair of curved tracks 84 and rollers 92 at the rear of the cutting head 16 , well above the ground, allowing the front of a conveyor 14 to be brought near the ground and close behind the sod cutting knife 38 . The curved tracks 84 have a common center of curvature located on the axis 82 of the front pivot shaft 80 so that they have the same effect as a horizontal rear pivot shaft located close to the ground and aligned with the front piv ot shaft 80 .
