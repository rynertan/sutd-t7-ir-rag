Among the above enumerated compounds, N glycidylor N 2 methylglycidyl substituted compounds derived from lower fatty acid amides can be isolated and purified with comparative ease by such procedures as distillation and the like. However, other N glycidyl or N 2 methylglycidylsubstituted compounds, particularly N,N diglycidyl or N,Ndi 2 methylglycidyl compounds, are so low in volatility that it is difficult to isolate them by such procedures as distillation and the like. On the other hand, glycidyl and 2 methylglycidyl groups constitute highly reactive substituents and, therefore, react with reactive compounds such as alkaline substances coexisting in the reaction system to cause side reactions such as cleavage of the epoxy ring, the ensuing addition condensation, and the like.Accordingly, the epoxy equivalent of the product tends to become higher than the theoretical value and the magnitude of the deviation depends on the reactivity of the amide compound used. Generally, aromatic amide compounds seem to give an epoxy equivalent approaching the theoretical value. The above described N glycidyl substituted amide compounds and N 2 methylglycidyl substituted amide compounds of the present invention have wide applications in the manufacture of reactive diluents, crosslinking agents, epoxidizing agents, resin modifiers, epoxy resins, adhesives, coating materials, electronic materials, composite materials, and the like, as is the case with conventionally known monoglycidyl ether compounds such as butyl glycidyl ether, allyl glycidyl ether, and phenyl glycidyl ether monoglycidyl ester compounds such as glycidyl methacrylate diglycidyl ether compounds typified by bisphenol epoxy resins diglycidyl ester compounds such as diglycidyl phthalate diglycidylamine compounds such as N,N diglycidylaniline and N,N diglycidyltoluidine tetraglycidylamine compounds such as N,N,N ,N tetraglycidylxylylenediamine and N,N,N ,N tetraglycidyldiaminodiphenylmethane mono 2methylglycidyl ether compounds such as phenyl 2 methylglycidyl ether mono 2 methylglycidyl ester compounds such as 2methylglycidyl methacrylate di 2 methylglycidyl ether compounds typified by methyl substituted bisphenol epoxy resins di 2 methylglycidyl ester compounds such as di 2methylglycidyl terephthalate di 2 methylglycidylamine compounds tetra 2 methylglycidylamine compounds and the like.
