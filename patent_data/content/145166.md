## Description
This invention relates to medical devices incorporating shape memory alloys, and to improvements therein. Materials, both organic and metallic, capable of possessing shape memory are well known. An article made of such materials can be deformed from an original, heat stable configuration to a second, heat unstable configuration. The article is said to have shape memory for the reason that, upon the application of heat alone, it can be caused to revert, or to attempt to revert, from its heat unstable configuration to its original, heat stable configuration, i.e. it remembers its original shape. Among metallic alloys, the ability to possess shape memory is a result of the fact that the alloy undergoes a reversible transformation from an austenitic state to a martensitic state with a change in temperature. This transformation is sometimes referred to as a thermoelastic martensitic transformation. An article made from such an alloy, for example a hollow sleeve, is easily deformed from its original configuration to a new configuration when cooled below the temperature at which the alloy is transformed from the austenitic state to the martensitic state. The temperature at which this transformation begins is usually referred to as M Many shape memory alloys SMAs are known to display stress induced martensite SIM . When an SMA sample exhibiting stress induced martensite is stressed at a temperature above M In U.S. Patent Application No. 541844, which was filed on 14.10.83 and served to establish a priority date for EP A 140621, a nickel titanium vanadium alloy having SIM over a wide temperature range is disclosed. Shape memory alloys have found use in recent years in, for example, pipe couplings such as are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,035,007 and 4,198,081 to Harrison and Jervis , electrical connectors such as are described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,740,839 to Otte Fischer , switches such as are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,205,293 , actuators, etc. Various proposals have also been made to employ shape memory alloys in the medical field. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,620,212 to Fannon et al. proposes the use of an SMA intrauterine contraceptive device, U.S. Pat. No. 3,786,806 to Johnson et al. proposes the use of an SMA bone plate, U.S. Pat. No. 3,890,977 to Wilson proposes the use of an SMA element to bend a catheter or cannula, etc. These medical SMA devices rely on the property of shape memory to achieve their desired effects. That is to say, they relay on the fact that when an SMA element is cooled to its martensitic state and is subsequently deformed, it will retain its new shape but when it is warmed to its austanitic state, the original shape will be recovered. However, the use of the shape memory effect in medical applications is attended with two principal disadvantages. First, it is difficult to control the transformation temperatures of shape memory alloys with accuracy as they are usually extremely composition sensitive, although various techniques have been proposed including the blending by power metallurgy of already made alloys of differing transformation temperatures see U.S. Pat. No. 4,310,354 to Fountain et al. . Secondly, in many shape memory alloys there is a large hysteresis as the alloy is transformed between austenitic and martensitic states, so that reversing of the state of an SMA element may require a temperature excursion of several tens of degrees Celsius. The combination of these factors with the limitation that a it is inconvenient to have to engage in any temperature manipulation, and b human tissue cannot be heated or cooled beyond certain relatively narrow limits approximately 0 60 C for short periods without suffering temporary or permanent damage is expected to limit the use that can be made of SMA medical devices. It would thus be desirable to develop a way in which the advantageous property of shape memory alloys, i.e. their ability to return to an original shape after relatively substantial deformation, could be used in medical devices without requiring the delicacy of alloying control and or the temperature control of placement or removal needed by present shape memory alloy devices. Use of SIM bone repair plates has been suggested by Oonishi TiNi Alloy with Super Elasticity , Orthopaedic Surgery, Vol.32, No.10 Oct.1981 , page 1180 and SIM orthodontic arch wire has been tested by Watanabe Japanese J. Dental Engineering, Vol.23, No.61 1982 , pages 47 57 . Such devices are first attached in their unstressed state to a broken bone or to a tooth within the body, and are subsequently stressed and attached to another part of the bone or another tooth so that the stressed device within the body applies continuous corrective pressure. The present invention provides a medical device suitable for placement within or proximate to a mammalian body for treatment of the mammalian body, the device comprising The device according to the present invention, may, for example, be used as a catheter, for example a tracheal catheter, or an intrauterine contraceptive device. The invention will now be descirbed, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein The invention will be discussed first by introducing the concept of stress induced martensite and the effect achievable by its use, and then by examples showing how SIM alloy elements can be substituted for conventional SMA elements in medical devices to achieve the beneficial effect of the invention. The Figures illustrate the phenomenon of stress induced martensite by means of stress strain curves. In both Figure 1 and Figure 2, the alloy is at a temperature between M In Figure 1, when a stress is applied to the alloy, it deforms elastically along the line OA. At a critical applied stress, σ In Figure 2, when a stress is applied to the alloy, it deforms elastically along line OA, then by SIM along line AB, and by deformation of the martensite to point C, just as in Figure 1. However, the stress strain behavior on unloading is significantly different, since the alloy is above A Suitable alloy for this invention i.e. those displaying stress induced martensite at temperatures near mammalian body temperature 35 40 C , may be selected from known SMAs by those of ordinary still in the art, having regard to this disclosure by testing for the existence of the SIM effect at the desired temperature. A particularly preferred alloy is the nickel titanium vanadium alloy referred to previously. The invention will now be discussed in detail by some Examples of the use of an SIM alloy. Wilson, in U.S. Patent No. 3,890,977, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses a catheter or cannula both being included hereinafter in the word catheter made of, or containing, an SMA element to cause all or a portion of the catheter to deplay in a useful form once introduced into a living body. However, this device has not been commercialized. Possible defects of the device which have prevented commercialization include i the inability slowly to emplace the catheter in a desired position when the transition temperature of the alloy is below body temperature since the SMA element will attempt to revert to its origional shape as it reaches body temperature , thus limiting the ability of the physician to place the device carefully and precisely or alternatively, if the transition temperature of the alloy is above body temperature, the requirement that the device be heated to a temperature above body temperature to cause recovery and that the device be placed so as not to change shape again when it re cools since the body temperature is below the transition temperature ii the inability to remove the device easily and iii the need for controlled temperature storage to prevent premature reversion to austenite of the SMA, with consequent shape change. The issue of removal of a catheter is especially significant, and not addressed by Wilson. Consider, for example, a tracheal puncture catheter. This should be straight for easy insertion into the trachea through a puncture into the front of the neck, but should curve after insertion so that the flow of air or oxygen through the catheter passes axially down the trachea rather than impinging on the surface of the trachea and damaging it. If a shape memory catheter is used as contemplated by Wilson, it would presumably become austenitic and bend after insertion see Figures 1a and 1b, and corresponding text, of Wilson . But removal would require either cooling to below the transition temperature which could easily mean cooling to so low a temperature that the tracheal tissue is damaged , removal in the bent shape presumably damaging tissue or forcing the austenitic SMA to straighten to permit direct removal unlikely to be satisfactory since the austenitic alloys e.g. of Ni Ti may have yield strengths of 690 MPa 100 ksi or more, and force sufficient to cause plastic deformation would be required . If an SIM element is used instead, however, removal can be accomplished almost as easily as insertion. If the catheter is made in a bent shape as in Wilson , it can be straightened by insertion of a straight pin down the catheter axis, the catheter deforming by the formation of stress induced martensite. Insertion of the catheter into the trachea is accomplished while the catheter is straight, at whatever rate is desired permitting easy and accurate placement , and the pin is gradually withdrawn to permit the catheter to take up its desired shape as the martensite reverts to austenite. It is assumed here that the stress strain curve of the alloy at the temperature of use is of the form of Figure 2, so spontaneous reversion occurs on removal of the stress induced by the pin . When removal is desired, it may be achieved simply by the gradual insertion of the pin, straightening the catheter and permitting easy withdrawal. Insertion of the catheter into the body and pin removal may, of course, take place simultaneously if desired. as may pin reinsertion and removal of the catheter from the body. Fannon et al, in U.S. patent No. 3,620,212, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, discloses an intrauterine contraceptive device an IUD proposed to be formed of a shape memory alloy. The device is suggested to be deformed in the martensitic phase the transition temperature being below the temperature of the uterus , and the deformed device insulated with, e.g., wax and inserted it. Removal is contemplated only by using two SMA elements in opposition, the higher temperature one being martensitic at body temperature but strong enough so that, if heated, it will overcome the lower temperature element and deform the IUD back to a removable shape. The heating contemplated is electrical. The storage problem discussed in Example II also exists here, so that the device must be stored below its transition temperature. By the use of an SIM element. however, these disadvantages may be overcome. Again, assume that the alloy is SIM pseudoelastic, i.e. that it has the stress strain curve of Figure 2. Then an IUD may be formed into the desired shape in the austenitic state, and deformed by compression into a tubular placement device the deformation being such that the strain levels lie within the plateau of the stress strain curve . When the placement device is inserted into the uterus, the IUD may be deployed by extrusion of the IUD from the placement device. Deployment is then controlled but immediate, so that the physician may satisfy himself with placement. Removal is the reversal of placement. The placement device is inserted into the uterus, the IUD deformed by withdrawal into the placement device, and the placement device withdrawn. Temperature control is not required. The use of tubular coiled wire stent grafts has been discussed in the medical literature since 1969. Although the coils helped maintain patency of the vessels in which they were placed, they were difficult of insertion unless narrow enough to significantly narrow the lumen of the vessel. Recently it has been proposed, see Radiology, v. 147, pp. 259 60 and pp. 261 3 1983 , the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference, to use SMA wire to form these tubular coils. The wire, which has a transformation temperature below body temperature, is introduced through a catheter after being straightened in its martensitic state. When the wire is heated. the coil re forms. Because of the difficulty of controlling the transformation temperature accurately, it has proved necessary to cool the straightened wire during insertion and or to heat the wire to form the coil after insertion. These procedures add to the complexity of the operation. If an SIM pseudoelastic wire is used to form the coil, which is then isothermally deformed by loading into a catheter, then the need for temperature control is avoided. The wire remains straight when in the catheter, but re forms the coil spontaneously when it is extruded from the catheter. Accurate placement is thus readily obtainable, since there is no urgency as might be required with a conventional shape memory effect element. It has similarly been proposed to use SMA wire to form a filter for emplacement by catheter in the vena cava to trap blood clots. The filter is formed in the austenitic state, the wire straightened in the martensitic state and inserted, and the filter re forms on warming. Just as for the coil stents discussed above, the use of an SIM pseudoelastic wire would greatly simplify manufacture and insertion of such a vena cava filter, permitting accurate placement with no need for urgency or temperature manipulation. From the foregoing, it is clear that, in a situation where narrow temperature differences are available or preferable, as often is the case in medical applications, mechanically constrained shape change is a much more useful solution than heat actuated shape change. It offers a degree of control heat actuation does not, it offers easier alloy composition control, it eases mating part tolerance requirements, and it offers simple mechanical reversal at minimal stress levels, all without heating, cooling or insulation complications.
