## Description
THE DESCRIPTIONTITLE OF THE INVENTION Current detection circuitTECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a current detec tion circuit applicable for an electronic type electric energy metering apparatus and the like.BACKGROUND ART Hitherto, as a current detection means for measur ing electric energy there has been such one as that shown in FIG. 1. That is, numeral 1 is a current detection circuit. Numerals .2 a , t2b are input terminals for leading a current to be detected and connected to a primary coil 3 of a current transformer 13 . The current transformer 13 further has an iron core 12 and a secondary coil 4 , and both ends of the secondary coil 4 are connected to a pair of terminals 5a , 5b as output terminals of the current transformer 13 . One of the output terminal 5a is connected to an inversion input terminal of an operational ampli fier 7 , and also connected through a feed back resistor 6 , which constitutes a current voltage conversion circuit 100 , to the output terminal 8a of a current detection circuit 1 which is also an output terminal of the opera tional amplifier 7 .The other of the output terminal 5b is connected to a non version input terminal of the operational amplifier 7 , and also connected to a reference potential and further connected to an output terminal 8b of the current detection circuit 1 . In the above constituted current detection circuit i , it is provided that numbers of turns of the primary ccil and the secondary coil are N1 and N2, respectively. liow, when a current I1 is inputted to the input terminals 2a , 2b , a magnetomotive force of Nl Il AT is generated in the primary coil 3 . And a secondary current 12 to fulfil N 2 I2 flows in the secondary 11 22 coil 4 in order to keep an equilibrium to the abovementioned ragnetomotive force. This secondary current 12 flows in the resistor 6 through the output terminal 5a , since an input impedance of the operational amplifier 7 is very large.The other output terrinal 5b is connected to the non inversion input terminal of the operational amplifier 7 and also to the reference potential and accordingly, provided that the direction of the abovementioned current 12 is in a direction of flowing out from the output terminal 5a , in case a resistance of the resistor 6 is R, the potential of the output terminal of the operational amplifier 7 falls to a potential of minus R 12 V cr the inversion input terminal , and makes a voltage between the non inversion terminal and the inversion terminal of the operational amplifier 7 R I2 A I , w rt in A is a gain of the operational amplifier 7 , to hcld a circuit equilibrium. Since the gain A of the operational amplifier 7 is generally around 10 the potential of the above mentioned inversion terminal becomes almost 0 Vi, and the potential of the output terminal of the operational amplifier becomes R.I2 vi. Therefore, for the above mentioned primary current, an output voltage Eo proportional to the input current I1 is obtainable by EMI3.1 As a means analogous to the above mentioned current detection means, for instance, an apparatus which is shown in FIG. 1 of the United States Patent No. 3875509 issued on April 1, 1975 to Miran Mikovic is known. However, the above mentioned conventional one has the following problem That is, when current to be detected is large, for instance, in an electronic type electric energy metering apparatus, it is necessary to introduce a current of 200 A at maximum as a primary current to the current transformer 13 , and in such case if a secondary current I2 is intended to be fed from a general operational amplifier 7 through a resistor 6 , the current is preferably not less than 5 mA .From this, provided that the secondary current 12 when the primary current I1 is made 200 A is, for instance, 2 mA , ratio of number of turn of the current transformer 13 becomesEMI3.2 and then, even though the number of turn of the primary coil is made 1 T , the number of turns of the secondary coil is required to be 100,000 T . The current transformer which requires such coil has the following shortcomings as a result that the number of turns is very large 1 Space occupation rate of the coil is low, and a bulky core is required and the current transformer itself becomes large. 2 A large amount of winding wire is necessary and material cost becomes expensive. 3 Work of winding wire takes long time. 4 Since a large amount of fine wire is wound, reliability is low. Furthermore, when it is intended that the above mentioned shortcoming is eliminated by using an operational amplifier 7 of a large current output type, such operational ampli fier 7 consumes a very large electric power, and therefore using it in the electronic type electric energy metering apparatus wherein whole circuit is intended to be operated with about 0.5 tW becomes impossible.DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present invention has a feature that output of a secondary coil is transformed into a very small current value which can be handled by semiconductor circuit, by utilizing a special current transformer which has a ternary coil with its both ends closed as a means to detect a large current by an operational amplifier constituted with semiconductor devices. By this, there is no need of the transformer having the secondary coil of a very large turn number nor the operational amplifier of a large current output. Accordingly, it is possible to obtain current detector circuit which is small in size, easy to manufacture low in cost, highly reliabile and small in power consump tion of themselves.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIG. 1 is the electric circuit showing the con ventional current detection circuit, and FIG. 2 is an electric circuit diagram showing one embodiment of the present invention. THE BEST MODE FOR EMBODYING THE PRESENT INVENTION FIG. 2 is an electric circuit showing one embodi ment of the current detection circuit in accordance with the present invention, and therein, the same numerals are designated for the same parts as in FIG. 1 and elucidations therefor are omitted. In FIG. 1, numeral 21 designates current trans former which has a primary coil 3 connected to a pair of input terminals 2a , 2b , an iron core 12 , a secondary coil 4 and besides a ternary coil 22 . The ternary coil 22 is connected to terminals 23a , 23b , which are closed by a conductor 24 . Next, the operation of the above mentioned con stitution is elucidated. A current which is inputted to the input terminals 2a , 2b are led to the primary coil 3 as the primary current I1 of the current transformer 21 . Against the primary current Ili the currents I2, I3 flow in the secondary coil 4 and the tenary coil 22 , respectively. Dkw, provided that in the secondary coil 4, the secondary current 12 is in a direction to flow out of the terminal 5a , the secondary current 12 does not flow in the inversion input terminal of the operational amplifier 7 but flows to the output terminal of the operational amplifier 7 through the resistor 6 , since the input impedance of the operational amplifier .7 is very large.Accordingly, the potential of the output terminal of the operational amplifier 7 becomes the value of the inversion input terminal , namely RI2, Since gain of the operational amplifier 7 is generally in a value of about 105, the voltage between the inversion input terminal and noninversion input terminal is almost 0 V , and potential between the terminals 5a and 5b becomes 0 V that is, the output ends of the secondary coil 4 are in a state which is equivalent to that of the shortcircuiting of the circuit. Relation of currents I1, 12 and I3 flowing in the primary coil 3 , secondary coil 4 and the ternary coil 22 in such state are elucidated. Now, by providing that numbers of turns of tne Friar coil 3 , the secondary coil 4 and the ternary coil 22 are N1, N2 and N3, respectively, and winding resistances of the secondary coil 4 and the ternary coil 22 are r2 and r3, respectively, and magnetic flux generated in the iron core 12 is , the following equations hold E2 N2 w E3 N3 w wherein E2 and E3 are voltages generated in the secondary coil 4 and the ternary coil 22 , respectively, and w is angular frequency of the current.Therefore, E2 r2 .I2 3 r3 I3 hold, and accordingly, the followings are obtained EMI7.1 On the other hand, since the ampere turn No it generated by the primary coil 3 becomes equal to the ampereturn generated by the ternary coil 22 , the following holds N1 Il N2 . 12 N3 I3 and from the above mentioned relations the followings hold EMI7.2 Now, provided that a relation I1 is 200 A and 2 mAJ is intended to be obtained, by selectingEMI8.1 is obtained.That is, when the primary current I1 is 200 fA , the current flowing in the secondary coil can be 2 imA . At this time, by making the resistance R of the resistor 6 1 Kf , a voltage of 1 2 mA 2 V is obtainable at the output terminal 8a of the current detection circuit 1 .Here, to obtain the relation ofEMI8.2 it is enough to wind the secondary coil 4 and the ternary coil 22 , for instance, with the same material of coil, and select the sectional area ratio thereof to be 1 99. This ratio can be accurately maintained by simply winding the secondary coil 4 and the ternary coil 33 parallelly. By the way, though the above mentioned embodiment is described on the case where the secondary coil 4 and the ternary coil 22 are of independent coils, both ones 4 and 22 need not be electrically insulated, and the may be one series coil. Furthermore, though the description is made on the case wherein the secondary coil 4 and the ternary coil 22 are wound with the same quality material, it is possible that these are of different kind of materials thereby giving a difference in resistance temperature coefficients thereof, thus giving desired temperature characteristic as the current detection circuit 1 .INDUSTRIAL UTILITY The present invention is not limited to the current detection means in an electronic type electric energy metering apparatus, but is easily applicable to a convertor for a large current measurement.
