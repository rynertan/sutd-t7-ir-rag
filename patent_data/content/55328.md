# A beam source for deposition of thin film alloys and method therefor.

## Abstract
The invention is an apparatus and method for achieving thin film deposition, of uniform composition, from evapo rated alloys. A source of wire alloy, selected for the particular thin film deposition on a substrate, is continuously fed through a region of high speed electron bombardment confined to an end of the wire, for evaporation of the wire in the vicinity of the substrate. An ion flux detector controls the rate of feeding of the wire source in accordance with the detected flux to lay down a uniform thin film of predeter mined thickness. A high potential is established between the wire and the source of the electrons and the liberated electrons are guided by the electric field toward the end of the wire being evaporated, which serves as an anode.
