# Magnetic head adjusting device.

## Abstract
Disclosed herein is a magnetic head adjusting device comprising a head retainer for retaining a magnetic head, the head retainer being mounted to a carrier adapted to reciprocate toward a center of a driving shaft for driving a magnetic disc, an azimuth adjusting mechanism for varying a direction of the head retainer with respect to a rotative axis parallel to the driving shaft, and a head attitude adjusting mechanism for letting the head retainer approach to or move away from the magnetic disc and incline relative to the same plane as the magnetic disc. With this arrangement, when a position and attitude of the magnetic head are varied during or after assembling of the device, such variation may be accurately corrected.
