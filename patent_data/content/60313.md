## Description
A method of preparing a suspension of fly ashes in water and a system of devices for production and pine transport of this suspensionThe subject of the invention is a method of preparing a suspension of fly ashes in water, those fly ashes being produced in the process of combustion of hard or brown coal, and a system of devices for production and pipe transport of this suspension to the point of its collecting or storage.The presently known and applied method of hydraulic offtaking of fly ashes from a power plant to storage yards consists in that dry ashes characterized by a considerable hydrophobia are directed from under dust extraction devices to flushing apparatuses of various types to which water is supplied at a proportion by weight being about a dozen times higher than the mass of ashes. A dilute mixture of fly ashes and water with a possible addition of granulated slag is further taken off through channels to intermediate tanks of appropriate capacity, wherefrom it is drawn by dredging pumps and transported through pipelines under pressure to open storage yards of a large area.After initial sedimentation of ashes over sediment water is drained via a system of overflow pumps to settling tanks wherefrom after further clarification it is turned back to the power plant by means of a separate installation of return water pumps and pipelines.This idea of hydraulic pipe transport of ash has been known for several dozen years and has been described in technical literature e.g. in the book by L.I. Kiercelli and W.J. Ryzkin Tieplowyje elektriczeskije stancji GEI,Moscow Leningrad 1949, or in the monography by Bures V., Busa K., Mlynek J., Policky K.L Hydraulicke odpopelnovaniSNTL, Prague 1964 . Within recent years this idea has not been changed, only particular elements of the system of devices have been improved.A disadvantage of the presently applied system of hydraulic transport of ashes is a large intensity by volume of the flow of the mixture, which is caused by the necessity to introduce into the system water at the amount which is several dozen times greater than the amount of ash in consideration of a considerable hydrophobia of fly ashes and a difficulty in their natural mixing with water. This causes a necessity of applying pumps and pipelines of large dimensions, requires an introduction of a returnwater installation, and causes a large consumption of electric energy and high losses of water.The object of the invention is to design a method of producing from dry fly ashes characterized by a considerable hydrophobia a suspension in water of a high concentration of ashes, as well as a system enabling production and transportation of such a suspension to the place of its collection or storage.The essence of the system of devices according to the invention consists in that a set of devices an ash storage reservoir, an ash feeder, an ash weigh feeder, water feeder, a mixer, and a suspension tank are connected in a gravitation train with a pump and via said pump with a pressure pipeline of the suspension and further on with the place of collection or storage of the suspension. In the aforesaid mixer at least two agitators are applied in a form of shafts having horizontal axes with several bladerings mounted on them, said agitators spinning in opposite directions in each cycle of producing the suspension from a weighed batch of ashes. Said mixer is also provided with an inlet for ashes which is situated over one agitator and with an inlet for water situated over the other agitator.In the above mentioned suspension tank compressed air is introduced to the suspension through air nozzles located on the bottom of the tank, due to which homogeneity of the suspension is maintained by barbotage.The essence of the method of preparing a suspension according to the invention consists in preparing a suspension of dry fly ashes in batches, in periodically repeated cycles.In the course of each cycle dry ashes taken off from under dust extracting units are proportioned by weight into the mixer together with a batched amount of water, according to a required concentration of dry fly ashes water 1 3 by weight, and preferably from 1 1 to 3 1. Then dry fly ashes are dynamically mixed with water for a period of 2 to 4 minutes. During mixing in the mixer, in the first phase the stream of water, at a speed of at least 2 m sec given to it by the blades of one agitator spinning horizontally, collides with a stream of ashes of a speed of at least 2 m sec given to it by the blades of the other agitator spinning in the opposite direction, and penetrates it.A mixture of ashes and water thus obtained is separated into two streams at each revolution of the agitators, and said streams run against each other and after the end of the mixing process they form a slow settling suspension of fLy ashes in water of the rheological properties similar to the properties of the liquid. The process of mixing of a determined amount of ashes and water in repeated cycles creates a possibility of producing a homogeneous suspension in the whole volume and renders it possible to obtain batches of a suspension of always the same concentration of ashes and provides for a control of the process.The method and the system according to the invention eliminates the disadvantages of the hitherto applied methods of hydraulic transport of ashes.The example of the system of devices for production and pipe transport of the suspension is presented schematically in the attached fig. 1. The installation for production and pipe transport of a suspension of ay ashes consists of an ash storage reservoir 1, an ash feeder 2, an ash weigh feeder 3, a water feder 4, a mixer 5 and a suspension tank 6, which are connected in a gravitation train with a pump 7, and via said pump with a suspension pressure pipeline 8, and further on with the place of collection or storage of the suspension 9.The mixer 5 is provided with two agitators 12 in a form of shafts having horizontal axes provided with blade rings mounted on them alternatively, and with an ash inlet 13, situated over one agitator and a water inlet 14 situated over the other agitator. The suspension tank 6 is provided with air nozzles 10 located on its bottom.Preparation of a suspension of fly ashes and their transport in this example is carried out in the following way. Dry fly ashes from under dust extracting units are transported to the ash storage reservoir 1, wherefrom they are fed via the ash feeder 2 to the ash weigh feeder 3, and then through the ash inlet 13 in the mixer 5 to said mixer 5.Then, through the water inlet 14 water is fed to the mixer 5. Both dry fly ashes and water are introduced into the mixer 5 in batches at the weight ratio of, for example 2 1, i.e. ashes at the amount of 2 tons and water at an amount of 1 ton. Each batch of ashes and water is dynamical ly mixed for a period offor example 3 minutes during which, in the first phase the stream of water at a speed of 2 m sec, given to it by the blades of one horizontally spinning agitator, collides with the stream of ashes of a speed of 2 m sec, given to it by the blades of the other agitator, spinning in the opposite direction, and penetrates it. At each revolution of the agitators 12 the mixture of ashes and water thus obtained is separated into two streams which run against each other and after the end of the mixing process they form a slow settling suspension of fly ashes in water of the rheological properties similar to the properties of the liquid. The suspension prepared in this manner flows down by gravitation to the suspension tank 6.Into the suspension being in.the tank 6 compressed air is forced through air nozzles 10 under a pressure of for example 0.6 MPa in order to maintain the homogeneity of the suspension by means of barbotage. From the tank 6 the suspension is drawn by the pump 7 and pressed through the pressure pipeline 8 to the suspension storage yard 9.The advantages of the solution according to the invention are as follows a reduction of the by volume intensity of the flow of the mixture of dry fly ashes with water, which causes a reduction of the dimensions and of the number of pumps and pipelines, a reduction of the consumption of electric energy, an elimination of return water installation, a limitation of losses and consumption of water.The invention can be applied in power plants, thermalelectric power stations and heating plants, in which as a result of a combustion of hard or brown coal dry fly ashes are produced.
