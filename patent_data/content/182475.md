# Signal amplifier and telephone line feed circuit.

## Abstract
A signal limiting amplifier 53 includes interstage limiting devices 55 to restrict the range of output voltage signals. The devices are base emitter circuits of transistors, one of which operates in response to one polarity of signals and has its collector terminal unconnected, and the other of which operates in response to the other polarity of signals and has its collector circuit connected when limiting to operate an appropriate utiliza tion circuit 20 . In one embodiment the limiting amplifier 53 is applied as a common mode feedback amplifier in a telephone line feed circuit, and the limiter signal 27 is used to limit large longitudinal signals on a customer line 10, 11 and to power down the line feed circuit 28 in the event the limited signals persist beyond a certain interval.
