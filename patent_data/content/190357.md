# APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING PROFILING IN ANY DIRECTION.

## Abstract
An apparatus for controlling profiling in any direction, permits profiling to be set in any direction and permits the profiling direction to be easily changed during the profiling operation. Memory means M stores the data that repre sents a profiling direction, i.e., stores an angle subtended by an axis for profile feeding and the X axis. Correction angle setting means COM sets the angle of correction relative to the axis for profile feeding. Adder means ADD adds the angle stored in the memory means M and the angle of correction set by the correction angle setting means CMO , and sends it to profile operation means PRO which calculates speed of motion in the direction of each axis to relatively move a model and a tracer head TH in a direction corresponding to the operation result of adder means ADD , the calculation being performed relying upon the operation result of adder means ADD and displacement signals from the tracer head TH .
