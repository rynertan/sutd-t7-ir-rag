## Description
Laser device and interferometer comprising such a laser device. The invention relates to a laser device including a laser resonator comprising two reflectors which are situated on one axis and means are provided for displacing of the reflectors alsong he said axis wherein one of the reflectors passes the generated beam of radiation, the device further comprising a beam splitter and a Fabry Perot interferometer the interterometer forming an effective wave length etalon, wherein at least part of the radiation bean impinges through the interferometer on a detection system, which controls the said means in such manner that the effective wavelength established by the etalon is equal to the effective wave length of the radiation generated by the laser. The invention also relates to an interferometer comprising such a laser device. Such a laser device and interferometer are known from the article Wellenlängenstabilisation , Feinwerktechnik und Messtechik 87 1979 8. It is described in this article that if the distance between the reflectors of a Fabry Perot interferometer is not influenced by the parameters which produce a variation of the refractive index of the ambient medium for example air , an effective wave length etalon is obtained. The effective wave length e e is defined as the wave length in free space free space is empty space divided by the refractive index n of the medium for example air .Thus e o n It is necessary that the medium between the reflectors of the Fabry Perot interferometer can assume the state temperature, pressure, humidity etc which prevails in the surrounding atmosphere. The space between the reflectors of the Fabry Perot interferometer therefore communicates with the surrounding atmosphere. Becouse the distance between the reflectors of the Fabry Pero interfeometer must be kept constant and temperature variations must have no influence on said distance between the reflectors, the spacing member between the reflectors is preferably manufactured from Zerodur. Zerodur is a trade name of Messrs.Schott, see Schott information No 1, 2. 1 21 The laser device described in the article above inentioned article Wellenlängenstabilisation ,Feinwerktechnik undMesstechnik 87 1979 8, a beam of radiation emmerging from a mono mode He Ne laser is split by a beam splitter and one of the splet beams thus formed passes divergingly through a Fabry Perot interferometer communicating with the ambient air. One of the interfering rings formed imponges on a detection system comprising two juxtaposed photo cells a socalled differential photo diode . If the refractive index in the etalon varies, the interference ring is displaced and the diodes are non uniformly exposed.A difference amplifier then conveys such a voltage to the means for displacing one of the reflectors of the laser that the effective wave length of the laser is adapted and the interference ring is again centered on the photo diodes. The mono mode He Ne laser used is expensive. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a laser device in which it is not necessary to use a mono mode laser. A laser device of the kind described in the opening paragraph is characterized according to the invention in that the etalon is centred directly on the said axis and the beam splitter is provided in the radiation path before or after the etalon. Because the etalon is provided directly in the radiation path of the generated radiation beam, one mode is selected and the other mode is rejected reflected when a comparatively cheap multimode He Ne laser is used. Its is possible to provide the beam splitter before the etalon in the radiation path and to cause one of the split beams, to pass through the etalon parallel to the other split beam to the detection system. However, it is also possible to provide the beam splitter after the etalon in the radiation path and to cause one of the split beams to be incident on the detection system. Just as in the described prior art laser device, the split beam which is incident on the detection system may be a diverging beam, in which an interence ring is formed which is incident on a diferential photo diode and is continuously centered thereon. It is also possible, however, for the detection system to be an intensity senitive detection system and the maximum of the intensity of the radiation path through the etalon to be established by reciprocating the laser reflector at fixed intervals of time Such an effective wave length stabilized laser device can often be used particularly readily as a radiationswource in an interferometer instead of frepuencystabilized laser device.In addition to a source of radiation such an interferometer comprisds a beam splitter to form a first and a second split beam from the bean of radiation generated by the swurce of radiation, which two split beams, after the first split beam has been reflected at a face of the object to be e camined, are made to coincide in the plane of a radiati3n sensitive detection system. Such an interferometer wliich is used as a displacement meter is described in an article in PhilipsTechnical Review iQ No 6 7, at gE 160 155, which article may be considered to be incorporated herein by reference. reflector is incorporated in the path of each of the split beams. One of these reflectors is accommodated so as te te stationary, while the second is connected rigidly t the article the displacement of which is to be measured. After reflection of the two split beams they are again made to converge by the beam splitter, said beams which have covered approximately the same path length interfering wit each other. The resulting intensity depends on the relative phase of the split beams and will hence vary periodically when the optical path lengh of the second split beam is increased or decreased continuously by a displacement of the object. A period of the interference pattern corresponds to a path length variation having the value of half an effective wave length of the light used.A periodic electric signal can be obtained by means of a radiation sensitive detector, and the number of cycles which thus is a measure of the displacement of the article can be counted. The above mentioned article in Philips Technical Review 30, No 6 7, E. 160 165 describes a special interferometer with particularly good properties, for example, an accuracy to a fraction of 1 um, simple digital indication and distinction between forward and backward displacements. However, the said properties can be obtained only when a special frequency stabillized laser source is used which provides a laser beam having two oppositely circularly polarized components of equal intensities but of different frequencies. Such a frequency stabilized laser source is very expensive. The stabilization method in which the Zeeman effect is used is described inAppl. Phys. Letters 6, 198, 1965. In Netherlands Patent Application 8005258 PHN 9846 is laid open to public inspection which may be deemed to be incorporated herein by reference, a similar very accurately operating interferometer is also described in which a laser device embodying the present invention can very readily be used. In this case the radiation sensitive detection system is a multiple photo cell censisting of a row of linear photo diodes which are in oparation are connected one after the other b an electronic switch to an electronic circuit for processing the signal generated in the photo diodes.As a result of this detection system operates as a moving frame shaped detector in which the frame period of the multiple photo cell corresponds to the period of the linear interference pattern of the two super imposed split beams. The invention described in said Patent Application uses the fact that a sinuoidal interference pattern can be generated in the interferometer and that the intensity variation in the interference pattern occurring as a result of a variation in the path length of a split beam may be considered az a displacement of said interference pattern.The displacement of such a pattern of light and dark lines which inturn may be considered as a frame can be determined by means of a reference frane in the form of a multiple photo cell. Such a multiple photo cell is described elaborately in United States Patent Specification No 3,973,119 PHN 7442 . According to said Patent Specification the displacement of an object can be measured by projection of a first frame which is connected to the article on a reference frame formed by the multiple photo cell. The accuracy of said displacement measurement is determined by the frame period of the first frame. Said frame period is, for example, 635 um. Via a suitable signal processing and interpolation within the signal period a displacement measurement up to an accuracy of in principle 0,5 um is possible. The invention will now be described in greater detail, by way of example, with reference to the drawing in which Figure 1 shows diagramatically a first laser device embodying the invention, and Figure 2 shows diagrammatically a second laser device embodying the invention. The laser of the device shown in Figure 9 comprises a glass envelope 1 which is filled with a gas for example, with a He Ne gas mixture , further comprises a laser campillary 2, and is sealed by means of two metal plates 3 and 4 having respective 5 and 6. Laser reflectors 7 and 8 consisting of a glass substrate on which reflective layers have been deposited on the side facing the inside of the envelope are connected against said plates opposite to the ends of the laser capillary 2. The laser reflector 8 is connected to the plate 4 by a cylinder 9 of an electrostrictive material which has two electrodes 10 and 11 between which a potential can be applied. By applying a potential the material of the cylinder 9 expands in the axial direction along axis 12 so that reflector 8 can be movedrelative to reflector 7.Other known means of moving the reflector 8 may, of course, also be used, for example electromagnetic,hydraulic or pneumatic means. By applying a sufficiently high potential between plate 3 which also forms the anode and the cathode which consiste of a coaxial metal cylinder 13, a gas discharge in the gas filled envelope 1 is produced which occurs via the laser capillary 2. The reflectors 7 and 8 together with the laser capillary 2 form the laser resonator. The generated beam of radiation 14 passes through a Fabry Pero interferometer 15 which is centered on axis 12 and forms an effective wave length etalon. Said etalon comprises a spacer 16 having one or more apertures 26 and two parrallel reflector 17 and 18 having a coefficient of reflection R of approximately 95 . Said reflectors also consist of a substrate on which reflecting layers have been vapour deposited.Becouse the spacer 16 is manufactured from Zerodur, the distance between the reflectors 17 and 18 is substantially constant and independent of the ambient temperature and humidity. The distance between the reflectors is in this case approximately 4mm. Fabry Perot interferometers are usually evacuated. By providing aperture 26 in theFabry Perot interferometer used in this case, the medium for example, air in the etalon between the reflectors can assume the state pressure, temperature and humidity etc which also prevails in the remaining part of the device. The beam 19 emanating from the etalon is split into two split beams 21 and 22 by means of a splitting mirror 20. The split beam 22 impinges on an intensity sensitive detection system 23, for example, a photo diode.Until the iutensity of the split beam 22 is maxiumum, a varying potential is applied via a control amplifier 24 between the electrodes 10 and 11 of the cylinder 9 of electro strictive material, and the laser is controlled so that the generated effective wave length corresponds to the effective wave length fixed by etalon 15. The maximum of the intensity of the radiation path through the etalon can be found by periodically reciprocating the laser reflectorBy providing, at point A in the path of radiation, a second etalon which is tuned to the same effective wave length as the first etalon but which has a different distance between its reflectors, the device can even be improved.By providing said second etalon in the device, the same mode is selected and the other modes are reflected every time when the deivice is switeleton Figure 2 shows diagrammatically part of another laser device embodying the invention. The beam of radiation 30 generated by a laser not shown here identical to that of Figure 1 is split into two paralle split beams 33 and 34 by means of a splitting mirror 31 and a mirror 32 which together form a beam splitter. Beam 34 passes through a diverging lens 35 and then, together with the split beam 33, through the Fabry Perot etalon 36. Said etalon comprises a spacer 38 of Zerodirhaving an aperture 37 and two reflectors 39 and 40 having a coefficient of reflection R of approximately 95 . In this case too the reflectors consist of a substrate on which reflecting layers have been vapour deposited. Because the spacer is manufactrured fromZerodur, the distance in this case 4 mm between the reflectors 39 and40 is substantially constant and independent of the ambient temperature and humidity. By providing aperture 37 in the etalon the medium for example, air in the etalon between the reflectors can assume the state pressure, temperature, humidity etc. which also prevails in the remaining part of the device. The split beam 34 made diverging by means of lens 35 falls, via a system of of lenses 41, on a frosted glass 42 on which a few interference rings are displayed.One of these interference rings is kept centrered on two juxtaposed photo cells 43 the signal of which tunes the laser not shown here via a difference amplifier 44 in such manner that the effective wavelength of the generated laser beam corresponds to the effective wave length which is fixed by the Fabry Perot etalon. It is of course also possible to use a detection system as used in Figure 2 in the laser device shown inFigure 1 and to use a detection system as used in theFigure device in device shown in Figure 2. In that case it is possible, aalos by to the second etalon at pointA in Figure 1, to provide before the detection system a second etalon which is tuned to the same effective wave length as the first etalon but which has a different distance between its reflectors. In a detection system as used in Figure 2, however, it is also possible to use a splitting mirror instead of mirror 32 and to cause the split beam passing through said splitting mirror to be incident on an intensity sensitive detection system via the second talon.
