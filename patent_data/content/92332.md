# LENS

## Abstract
Rod lenses comprise one or more transparent balls, e.g. sapphire bearings, embedded in a tramsparent cy linder of lower refractive index. Single ball lenses are par ticularly useful as collimating lenses for fibre optics, being cheap to make with high accuracy. Lenses having two spaced balls can be made to give erect images with 1 1 magnification, and arrays of such lenses are particularly suitable for various reprographic applications.
