# Drowsiness alarm system for a vehicle.

## Abstract
The drowsiness alarm system comprises a a steering angle pulse generation circuit 1, 2 which produces first and second angle pulses 2a, 3b at respective output terminals whenever the steering wheel is rotated clockwise and counter clockwise, respectively, through an angle equal to a predetermined angular increment b curved road detection circuit 3a responsive to the first and second steering pulses which counts the number of the first and second steering pulses separately and detects the vehicle travels on a curved road depending on whether the counted number of either of the first and second steering pulses reaches a first predeter mined number within a predetermined period of time or depending on whether the difference of the counted number between the first and second steering angle pulses reaches a second predetermined number within the predetermined period of time c a first counting circuit 3 12, 23 which counts the number of the first and second steering angle pulses 2a, 2b within the predetermined period of time and outputs a first alarm signal whenever the counted number reaches a third predetermined number d a second count ing circuit 31, 32 responsive to the curved road detection circuit which counts the number of the first and second steering angle pulses and outputs a second alarm signal whenever the counted number reaches a fourth predeter mined number greater than the third predetermined num ber and e an alarm unit 28 which produces an alarm to the driver in response to the first and second alarm signals.
