# Apparatus for transforming blanks into corresponding containers of parallelepiped shape.

## Abstract
The apparatus comprises first grasping means 14 designed to grip the bottom blank 1 in a stack 12 and, in co operation first of all with second grasping means 13 , then with an intermediate arm 16 , and finally with third grasping means 18 , to open the blank whilst it is held stably in a forming station F , through the contemporaneous gripping of two lateral walls 5 and 8 that are maintained orthogonal by the said first and third means 14 and 18 . At the said station F , first folding means 43 , 41 and 30 attend to the folding of the flaps 6a , 8a , 7a and 5a that define the bottom 50a of the container 50 , subsequently to which a stack of articles is placed inside the container 50 . Once this has been done, second folding means 43 , 41 and 30 attend to the folding of the flaps 6b , 8b , 7b and 5b that define the cover 50b of the container 50 . Then with the synchronous movement of the two frames 19 , each of which is provided with three of the four folding members 41 and 30 belonging both to the said first and second means, the transfer of the container 50 takes place towards the movement devices 44 connected to a banding group 46 .
