# Thermoplastic blend of polyolefin, isobutylene backbone elastomer and ethylene copolymer.

## Abstract
Compositions comprising a thermoplastic elastomeric blend of a polyolefin component, an isobutylene backbone elastomer component, and a copolymer of ethylene and an unsaturated ester of a lower carbocylic acid, such as ethylene vinyl acetate or ethylene methyl acrylate, are useful in the preparation of film and molded or extruded articles.
