# Video extractor.

## Abstract
A video extractor for a pulse radar apparatus comprises a memory 1 capable of storing a number of words corresponding with the number of range quanta, into which the range interval of the pulse radar apparatus is divided. The rate at which words are shifted in and out of memory corresponds with the counting rate of the range counter of the pulse radar apparatus. A video processor 2 updates the target information in the words in response to video, angular and range data from the pulse radar apparatus. The target information contains at least the initial azimuth value jb r , the final azimuth value je r , the weight E r and the target number N of a series of hits established in the range quantum r. A processor 7 , receiving at least the above information from the video processor determines the centre MR, M , the direction ø, the length L, the width B and the weight E₀ the target.
