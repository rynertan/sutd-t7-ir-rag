# Photosensitive ceramic coating composition.

## Abstract
A photosensitive ceramic coating composition which is fireable in a substantially nonoxidizing atmosphere compris ing an admixture of a finely divided particles of ceramic solids having a particularly defined surface area to weight ration and particle size, and b finely divided particles of an inorganic binder having a particularly defined surface area to weight ratio and particle size, dispersed in an organic medium comprising c an organic polymeric binder and d a photoinitiation system, dissolved in e photohardenable monomer and f an organic medium.
