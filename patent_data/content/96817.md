# Process for producing hydrogen fluoride.

## Abstract
A process for producing hydrogen fluoride with use of fluorite as starting material and by conducting reactions in a first reactor and a second reactor wherein a reaction of fluorite with sulfuric acid, sulfuric anhydride and steam in the first reactor is conducted at a conversion of from 35 to 90 while maintaining the reaction temperature within a range of from 140 to 240 C by controlling the respective amounts of the sulfuric anhydride, steam and sulfuric acid.
