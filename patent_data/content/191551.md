# Dimensional checking tool.

## Abstract
A dimensional checking tool for checking the flush and gap dimensions around a pressed panel has two probes 20 and 22 which move into and out of a housing 10, and are biassed in an outward direction, against the surfaces of a panel 34. Transduc ers or other devices 38 and 44 are sensitive to the positions of the probes and provide signals representative of the probe positions and which can be passed from the tool to an external data capture system.
