## Description
PROCESS OF PREPARING A SOLID CATALYTIC TITANIUM COMPONENT AND PROCESS FOR THE POLYMERIZATION OF 1 ALKENES USING SUCH A TITANIUM COMPONENT This invention relates generally to a process for preparing a solid titanium containing catalyst component useful for homopolymerizing l alkenes and for co polymerizing 1 alkenes with each other and or with ethylene, by complexing a titanium halide compound with an electron donor compound and combining, by grinding, the complex with a magnesium aluminum halide. The invention further relates to a process for homo polymerizing l alkenes and for copolymerizing l alkenes with each other and or with ethylene using such a titanium catalyst component. The expression magnesium aluminum halide is used here to mean a combination of a magnesium halide and an aluminum halide as an intimate mixture, a co crystalline compound, a complex, a solid solution or the like. The magnesium aluminum halide may, in addition, contain other components. A process as generally described above is known from U.K.Patent Publication No. 2,047,255 A. According to European PatentPublication No. 33,022 A 1, in order to lower the halogen content and the titanium content of the polymer obtained using the catalyst, the product obtained by grinding the titanium complex with the magnesium aluminum halide is suspended in an inert organic dispersant containing a dissolved organic aluminum compound. The solid which results is separated out and used as a finished titanium catalyst component. It has now been discovered that, specifically in the case of alkene polymerization catalysts formed by grinding a titanium halide compound complexed by an electron donor compound with a magnesium aluminum halide obtained by precipitation, catalytic activity and stereospecificity can be considerably improved by washing the ground product with a washing liquid containing one or a mixture of certain solvents in which the complex of the aluminum halide concerned and the electron donor concerned is at least partially soluble, and at least one alcohol, e.g. an aromatic alcohol, preferably an unsubstituted phenol or a phenol substituted with one or more halogen groups and or with one or more alkyl and or alkoxy groups with for instance 1 6 carbon atoms per group, for instance the cresols, the methoxy phenols, the xylenols, the ethyl phenols, the propyl phenols, the octyl phenols, the dibutyl phenols, the cumyl phenols or the naphthols, o cresol being the most preferred, the molar ratio between alcohol and titanium in the ground product ranging between 50 1 and 1 20, preferably between 20 1 and 1 10, and treating the washed product with a liquid titanium halide compound. Although the invention is not restricted by any theoretical consideration, it is believed that during the act of grinding a reaction occurs between the aluminum halide and the titanium halide compound electron donor complex whereby the electron donor is at least partly detached from the titanium halide compound and forms a complex with.the aluminum halide. The solvent washing step removes aluminum halide electron donor complex so formed. Next, titanium halide is taken up on sites vacated by the washed out complex. According to the invention a solid titanium catalyst component for the polymerization of l alkenes and for the copolymeriza tion of l alkenes with each other and or with ethylene is prepared by a process comprising A. forming a complex by exposing a titanium halide compound to an electron donor compound B. forming a magnesium aluminum halide by precipitation from an organic solvent C. forming a ground product by grinding said complex with said magnesium aluminum halide D. washing said ground product with a washing liquid containing a solvent which removes aluminum halide and electron donor, and at least one alcohol, the molar ratio between alcohol and titanium in the ground product ranging between 50 1 and 1 20 and E. exposing said washed product to a titanium halide com pound to form a finished titanium catalyst component. The titanium halide compound electron donor complex may be obtained in any known manner, for instance by bringing the components of the complex in contact with each other. A suitable method for preparing the said complex is adding to a solution of the titanium halide compound in question the electron donor in question, forming a precipitate of the said complex and separating off the titanium halide compound electron donor complex. The titanium component of this invention has a very high stereospecificity, is highly active and gives exellent powder morphology and bulk density. With this catalyst it is possible to obtain polymers, for example polypropylene, having a very low halogen content and a very low titanium content, such that a washing step following polymerization can be dispensed with. Moreover, the polymer exhibits a good particle size. Due to these desirable properties, the polymer is not only readily processable but also relatively non corrosive to processing equipment. The term titanium halide compound as used in titanium halide compound electron donor complex includes not only compounds derived wholly from titanium and halogen, but also compounds wherein a portion of titanium valences are used to form bonds to moieties other than halogen. The halogen moiety is preferably chloride, but may also be, for example, bromide and or iodide. Advantageously, the titanium halide compound is derived from tetravalent titanium. Examples are Tic4, TiBr4, TiI4 and Ti isobutoxy 2Cl2. Particularly suitable is TiCL4 For use in multi stage polymerizations, particularly those normally requiring more than half an hour for polymerization in the first stage before a second stage is started, titanium halide phenolates have particular advantages. For the sake of brevity, the aforementioned U.K.Patent Publication No. 2,047,255 is referenced for further details concerning titanium halide compounds which can be used. Suitable electron donors for use in making the titanium complex are, for example, oxygen containing electron donors such as aliphatic alcohols, aromatic alcohols e.g. phenols, ketones, aldehydes, carboxylic acids, acid halides, esters, ethers and acid amides, phosphorus containing electron donors such as phosphines, phosphites and phosphates, and nitrogen containing electron donors such as amines, nitriles, isocyanates and nitro compounds. For specific examples, U.K. Patent Publication No. 2,047,255 is again referenced.Ethers having 2 20 carbon atoms such as dimethylether, diethyl ether, di n butyl ether, di isoamyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, anisole or diphenyl ether, and organic esters having 2 40, and in particular 2 18 carbon atoms per molecule are especially favorable. The acid component of the ester normally contains 1 9 carbon atoms or is a natural fatty acid. The alcohol component of the ester normally contains 1 6 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable esters are methyl formate, cyclohexyl formate, ethyl acetate, vinyl acetate, amyl acetate, 2 ethylhexyl acetate, cyclohexyl acetate, ethyl propionate, amyl propionate, methyl butyrate, ethyl valerate, methyl chloroacetate, ethyl dichloroacetate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, n butyl acrylate, ethyl crotonate, dimethyl maleate, ethyl cyclohexane carboxylate, methyl benzoate, ethyl benzoate, isobutyl benzoate, octyl benzoate, cyclohexyl benzoate, phenyl benzoate, benzyl benzoate, phenyl ethyl benzoate,methyl toluate, ethyl toluate, isoamyl toluate, methyl anisate, ethyl anisate, y butyrolactone, e caprolactone, coumarin, phtalide and ethylene carbonate. Particularly preferred are esters derived from aromatic acids, especially esters of benzoic acid optionally substituted with alkyl or alkoxy groups. Alkyl esters having 1 4 carbon atoms in the alcohol moiety, particularly methyl or ethyl esters of benzoic acid, o or p toluene carboxylic acid or pmethoxy benzoic acid are especially favorable. The magnesium aluminum halide is obtained by precipitation from an organic solvent and should be virtually water free and, preferably, also virtually magnesium oxide free. The expressions virtually water free and virtually magnasium oxide free mean that the concentrations of water and magnesium oxide, respectively, in the magnesium aluminum halide support material are insignificant. Specifically, water should not be present in an amount greater than 0.2 percent, and preferably not more than 0.1 per cent, by weight of the support material. Magnesium oxide should not be present in an amount greater than 0.1, and preferably not greater than 0.01 mgeq, calculated as mgeq of base titratable with dilute strong acid such as 0.1 N hydrochloric acid, per gram of support material. The magnesium aluminum halide may in addition contain minor amounts of other metal ions, e.g. sodium, tin, silicon or germanium.The magnesium aluminum weight ratio ranges preferably from 1 3 to 100 1, and advantageously is between 1 1 and 20 1. The halide is preferably chloride, but may also be, for example, bromide or iodide or a mixture thereof. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the magnesium aluminum halide is obtained by precipitation from a solution containing an organic aluminum compound and an organic magnesium compound by using a precipitating halogenating agent having the formula RXm, wherein R denotes a hydrocarbon, a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom, X denotes a halogen atom, and m is an integer from 1 to 10. The compound RXm may be, for example, a hydrogen halide e.g. in the form of the water free gas or an aliphatic halogen containing compound e.g. having 1 8 carbon atoms per molecule. Hydrogen halides and alkyl halides are preferred. Exemplary as alkyl halides are methyl chloride, methylene chloride, chloroform, ethyl bromide, ethylene dichloride, isopropyl chloride, n butyl iodide and the like.Free halogens and interhalogen compounds such as C12, bur2, 12, ICl,ICl3 and BrCl may also be employed. The organic aluminum compound preferably contains one or more hydrocarbon groups bonded directly to the metal. The hydrocarbon groups preferably contain 1 to 10 carbon atoms. Examples are trialkyl or trialkenyl aluminum compounds such as triethyl aluminum, tripropyl aluminum, triisobutyl aluminum, triisoprenyl aluminum, trihexyl aluminum and trioctyl aluminum dialkyl aluminum hydrides such as diethyl aluminum hydride or diisobutyl aluminum hydride dialkyl aluminum halides, in particular a chloride and bromide, diethyl aluminum chloride and diethyl aluminum bromide being particularly suitable, but wherein di n butyl aluminum chloride or methyl n butyl aluminum chloride, for example, may also be employed. Further, monoalkyl alu minum dihalides such as ethyl aluminum dichloride, n butyl aluminum dichloride or n hexyl aluminum dibromide are also suitable.If a halogen containing organic aluminum compound is used, the halogen preferably corresponds to that used in the halogenating agent. Trialkyl aluminum compounds are preferred. The organic magnesium compound may be, for example, a dialkyl magnesium or an alkyl magnesium halide. The hydrocarbon groups again preferably contain 1 to 10 carbon atOms. Examples are ethyl magnesium chloride, n butyl magnesium chloride, isopropyl magnesium bromide, n decyl magnesium iodide, ethyl n butyl magnesium, di n butyl magnesium, di isoamyl magnesium and dia octyl magnesium. The conversion of the organometallic aluminum and magnesium compounds to the magnesium aluminum halide is effected by precipitation of the magnesium aluminum halide from a solution of the organometallic compounds in a suitable solvent. Examples of suitable solvents are aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic and mixed aromatic aliphatic hydrocarbons having 3 8 carbon atoms per molecule, such as butane, isobutane, n hexane, n heptane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene and the xylenes. The solvent is preferably inert under the reaction conditions employed. Further details concerning this preferred embodiment are described in U.K. Patent Publication 2,047,255. Using this preferred embodiment, a significant improvement in catalytic activity can be achieved, along with a high stereospecificity. According to a very suitable method the complexed titanium halide compound and the magnesium aluminum halide prepared as described above are then mixed and the mixture is ground in a ball mill for a period between 5 hours and 50 hours. The term ground product is used hereinafter to describe the product resulting from the grinding process. The ground product is then washed with a washing liquid containing a suitable solvent as indicated above and treated with a liquid titanium halide compound to form the finished catalyst component. The titanium content in the ground product and also in the finished catalyst component is usually between 0.1 and 10 percent by weight. The titanium magnesium aluminum weight ratio in the ground product may be 1 0.5 20 0.1 5 , and advantageously is 1 0.5 2.5 0.2 1 . The electron donor is present in the titanium component in an amount of, for example 0.1 to 5 molecules per titanium atom. A typical example of the various contents in the finished titanium catalyst, although these vary depending on the conditions for the catalyst preparation, is 1 10 percent by weight of titanium, 16 25 percent by weight of magnesium, 0.05 2.0 percent by weight of aluminum, 45 65 percent by weight of halogen and 5 25 percent by weight of the electron donor. As mentioned above, the ground product is washed with a washing liquid containing a suitable solvent for the complex formed by the aluminum halide and the electron donor compound during the grinding process and by preference at least one aromatic alcohol. Example of solvents preferred for this washing step are liquid at the temperature and pressure employed aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, aromatic and mixed aromatic aliphatic hydrocarbons having 4 12 carbon atoms per molecule, such as butane, isobutane, nhexane, n heptane, cyclohexane, tetralin, decalin, benzene, toluene and the xylenes. Halogenated hydrocarbons such as CC14 or C2C16 can also be used. If desired, the solvent may contain harmless i.e. nonreactive additives. Examples of the alcohols preferably used are unsubstitued phenol or a phenol substituted with or more halogen groups and or with on or more alkyl or alkoxy groups with for instance 1 6 carbon atoms per group, for instance the cresols, the methoxy phenols, the xylenols, the ethyl phenols, the propyl phenols, the octyl phenols, the dibutyl phenols, the cumyl phenols or the naphthols. O cresol is the most preferred. The washing treatment is carried out at a temperature e.g.between 250 and 425 K, and preferably between 330 and 380 K. The pressure is not critical and may be between 10 and 1000 kPa. The amount of washing liquid used is e.g. between 1 and 1000, preferably between 5 and 100 grams per gram of ground product. The washing conditions are such that a substantial quantity of the aluminum halide electron donor complex is removed from the ground product. Under these conditions some titanium may also disappear from the ground product.The weight ratio between solvent and alcohol in the washing liquid is preferably between 2 1 and 2000 1, more particularly between 5 1 and 200 1. The washed product is then treated with a liquid titanium halide compound. The liquid titanium halide compound may be an undiluted titanium halide compound which is liquid per se, or a liquid solution of a titanium halide compound in a suitable solvent. Compounds of tetravalent titanium are the most suitable. For examples of suitable titanium halide compounds, the same titanium compounds used to make the titanium halide compound electron donor complex may be employed. Here too, TiC14 is particularly suitable. If a solution of titanium compound is employed the same solvents may be used as those mentioned above for washing the ground product. The treatment with the liquid titanium halide compound is effected at a temperature e.g. between 250 and 450 OK, preferably between 320 and 420 K. The pressure is not critical and may be between 10 and 1000 kPa. The amount of liquid titanium halide compound, expressed as the number of mmoles of Ti per gram of washed product, is e.g. between 1 and 1000 mmoles gram, preferably between 5 and 500 mmoles gram. Amounts larger than 1 mole per gram may be used but offer no advantage. After this treatment, the titanium catalyst is preferably after washed with a second washing liquid. As second washing liquid the same solvents are suitable as the ones already mentioned for use in the washing liquid for the ground product. As second washing liquid also mixtures of these solvents or of these solvents with the alcohols mentioned above may be used. To carry out the homo polymerization of l alkenes or the copolymerization of one or more l alkenes with each other and or with ethylene, the finished catalyst component is used in combination with an organometallic component derived from a metal from groups I III of the Periodic Table having hydrocarbon groups bonded directly to the metal. Examples are trialkyl aluminum compounds, alkyl aluminum alkoxides, alkyl aluminum hydrides, alkyl aluminum halides, dialkyl zinc compounds and dialkyl magnesium compounds. Among these, the organoaluminum compounds are particularly suitable.Examples of organoaluminum compounds are trialkyl and trialkenyl aluminum compounds such as triethyl aluminum, tripropyl aluminum, trtisobutyl aluminum, triisoprenyl aluminum, trihexyl aluminum and trioctyl aluminum alkyl aluminum compounds in which two or more aluminum atoms are interconnected by means of an oxygen or nitrogen atom such as C2H5 2AlOAl C2H5 2, iso C4Hg 2AlOAl iso C4H9 2 or C2H5 2AlNHAl C2R5 2 dialkyl aluminum hydrides such as diethyl aluminum hydride or diisobutyl aluminum hydride dialkyl aluminum halides, in particular a chloride or bromide, diethyl aluminum chloride and diethyl aluminum bromide being particularly suitable, but wherein other dialkyl aluminum halides having preferably l to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl group such as dia butyl aluminum chloride and methyl nbutyl aluminum chloride are also suitable and dialkyl aluminum alkoxides or dialkyl aluminum phenoxides, e.g. diethyl ethoxy aluminum or diethyl phenoxy aluminum. The trialkyl aluminum compounds are most preferred. Additionally, the organometallic component may contain a trialkyl aluminum compound as well as a dialkyl aluminum halide, or a mixture of a dialkyl magnesium compound and a monoalkyl aluminum dihalide. The alkyl groups of the metal alkyl compounds preferably contain 1 10 carbon atoms each or are a palmityl or stearyl group. The organometallic component preferably comprises a complex of an organometallic compound, in particular a trialkyl aluminum compound, and an ester of an oxygen containing organic acid. As ester, the same esters may be used which are employed as electron donor to make the titanium halide compound electron donor complex, particularly the esters of aromatic carboxylic acids. Advantageously, a portion of the organometallic compound, e.g. 50 90 Z, is present in non complexed state. The Al Ti atomic ratio of finished catalyst component plus organoaluminum component is normally between 10 and 1000 the molecular atomic ratio of total bound Lewis base in the catalyst to Ti is normally between 1 and 200. The catalyst provided according to this invention finds application especially in the stereospecific polymerization of 1alkene monomers having at least 3 carbon atoms, e.g. up to 6 carbon atoms, per molecule, such as propylene, 1 butylene, 4 methyl 1 pentene and l hexene, and in the copolymerization of these l alkenes with each other and or with ethylene. Copolymers with a random distribution of the various monomers and block copolymers can be prepared. If ethylene is used as comonomer, it is generally included in the monomer mixture in minor amounts not exceeding 30, and preferably between 1 and 15 percent by weight. The process according to the invention is especially useful for the preparation of isotactic polypropylene, random copolymers of polypropylene with minor quantities of ethylene and block copolymers of propylene and ethylene.For the preparation of block copolymers, any desired order of monomer addition may be employed. The conditions under which the polymerization reaction with the catalyst titanium component is carried out do not differ from those known in the art. The reaction may be carried out in the gas phase or in the presence of a dispersant. The dispersant may be inert or a monomer in a liquid form. Examples of suitable dispersants are aliphatic hydrocarbons having 3 8 carbon atoms per molecule such as propylene, l butylene, butane, isobutane, n hexane, n heptane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene and the xylenes. If the polymerization is conducted in the liquid phase, the concentration of the titanium catalyst is preferably 0.001 0.5 mmoles, calculated as titanium atoms, and the concentration of the organometallic component 0.1 50 mmoles, both per liter of liquid phase. The titanium catalyst component and the organometallic component can be introduced in the polymerization reactor both together and separately. The polymerization temperature is generally between 190 and 475 K, and preferably between 310 and 375 OK. The pressure may be between 100 and 3000 kPa. If desired, the molecular weight of the polymer may be regu lated during the polymerization, for example by carrying out the polymerization in the presence of hydrogen or another known molecular weight regulator. The polymerization reaction may be carried out batchwise as well as continuously. The invention is explained by the following non restricting examples and comparative experiment.Example IA.1 Catalyst Preparation 6.5 ml of water free ethyl benzoate EB , dissolved in 75 ml water free gasoline, is added dropwise to a solution of 5 ml TiC14 in 125 ml gasoline at 273 K.
