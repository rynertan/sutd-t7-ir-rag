# RECOMBINANT DNA MOLECULES, PROCESS FOR THEIR PRODUCTION, THEIR USE FOR PRODUCTION OF HEPATITIS B SURFACE ANTIGEN HBSAG AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THIS HBSAG

## Abstract
Described are a recombinatn DNA molecules containing a DNA fragment from Hepatitis B Virus comprising the structu ral gene of the Hepatitis B surface antigen b recombinant cloning vehicles containing said recombinant DNA molecules c microbial hosts containing said recombinant cloning vehi cles d genomes or parts thereof of animal viruses as eukary otic vectors containing said recombinant DNA molecules or recombinant cloning vehicles for selection of vertebrate cells and expression of at least one Hepatits B surface antigen in the selected cells e established vertebrate cell lines continu ously producing in a nutrient medium large amounts of at least one Hepatitis B surface antigen which is released into the nu trient medium f compositions containing at least one Hepati tis B surface antigen as produced by said cell lines for stimulat ing the production of antibodies in humans to Hepatitis B Virus infection or for detecting Hepatitis B Virus infection or antibod ies to Hepatitis B Virus.
