# Collet type drill.

## Abstract
A collet type drill 10 includes a pressure foot member 18 which is connected with a drill motor and with a feed means 24 . A collet 44 is operably connected to and movable relative to the foot member 18 , and when actuated, connects the drill 10 to the work piece 20 . A clamp bushing 36 has one end pivotally connected with the collet 44 and encircles a cylindrical sleeve 26 that has a transverse slot 28 extending therethrough. The bushing 36 is connected to the pressure foot member 18 . A clamping piston 32 extends through the sleeve 26 and carries a connecting pin 30 that extends through the slot 28 in the sleeve 26 into the clamp bushing 36 whereby the bushing 36 and collet 44 are movable together in response to movement of the clamping piston 32 to force the collet 44 into holding engagement with the work piece 20 .
