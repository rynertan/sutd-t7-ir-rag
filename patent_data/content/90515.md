# Treatment of solutions to facilitate the removal of ferric iron therefrom.

## Abstract
A process for treatment of an acidic solution contain ing ferric iron and at least one non ferrous metal, prior to removal of ferric iron therefrom, is characterised by adding a specified amount of at least one neutralizing agent, and separating off from the solution any residue or undissolved neutralizing agent remaining after neutralization, thereby producing a solution possessing an acid consuming capac ity termed negative acidity , and still containing substan tially all the dissolved ferric iron in solution, and from which ferric iron can subsequently be removed with the generation of less acid compared to that generated from solutions partially neutralized according to the prior art.
