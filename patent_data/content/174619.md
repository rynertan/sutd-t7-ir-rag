## Description
INDUSTRIAL ROBOT WITH SERVO SYSs BACRGROUS OF THE Ih7rEhTION The present invention relates generally to an industrial robot with a servo Eystem for operating robot arms so as to position a working end at a predetermined working position on a workpiece. More specifically, the invention relates to a multi axis robot and an operation control system for actuating robot arms from an initial position to the working position. In recent years, industrial robots have become popular in various industries because of their capacity for accurate repetition and relatively high efficiency.Since one of the most important advantages of installing industrial robots is high efficiency in repeating simple operations, robots are required to operate at ever higher speeds. However, various factors limit acceleration of robot operations. One important factor preventing robots from being operated at ultimate speed is the inertial pseudo forces generated during robot operation. Especially, the inertia of the robot arm or arms limits the maximum speed of robot arm movement. Therefore, in order to enable robots to be operated at higher speeds, the inertia of the robot arms must be reduced. Also, it is necessary to stop the robot at precisely the desired positions during its operation. In order to accurately stop a robot at a desired position, a robot arm is operated through an initial acceleration zone, an intermediate constant speed zone and a final deceleration zone. In conventional robot operation, in order to move the working end of the robot to the working position, the working end must pass one or more transient points where the robot arm comes essentially to rest. For example, assuming the working end moves from an initial point to a working point through an intermediate transient point which does not fall on the straight line connecting the initial point and the working point, acceleration zones, constant speed zones and deceleration zones must be defined both between the initial point and the intermediate point and between the intermediate point and the working point. This clearly loses time by stopping the working end at the intermediate transient point.As set out above, since the maximum robot arm operation speed is determined by the distance through which the robot arm moves and the acceleration and deceleration characteristics of the robot servo system, stopping the robot at the transient point prevents the robot from being operated at its highest possible speed. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A principle object of the present invention is to provide an industrial robot which can operate at higher efficiency than the conventional robots.

When the housing 124 is mounted on the upper plate 111 of the first pivotal arm 103 with the support section 126 extending through the hole 112, the flange 128 contacts the edges of the hole 112. In this position, the through openings 129 in the flange 128 can be aligned with the slots 113. Also, the threaded opening 130 can be aligned with the opening 115. A fastening plate or plates 131 are attached to the lower surface of the upper plate 111.The fastening plate 131 has sections 132 to which fastening nuts 133 are secured. The fastening plate 131 is attached to the upper plate 111 so that the fastening nuts 133 align with the slots 113 on the opposite side of the flange 128. Fastening bolts 134 pass through the openings 129 and the slots 113 to engage the fastening nuts 133.Thus, the housing 124 supporting the second servo system 119 is firmly mounted on the upper plate 111 of the first pivotal arm 103. With this arrangement, since the slots 113 in the first pivotal arm 103 lie substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the first pivotal arm 103, the first pivotal arm 103 and the housing 124 can be displaced somewhat along the longitudinal axis of the arm 103. This allows adjustment of the position of the second servo system 119 relative the first pivotal arm 103. An adjusting bolt 135 extends through the recess 114 and the hole 115 and engages the threaded hole 130 in the housing 24. A driving pulley 136 is fixed to the lower end of the output shaft 127 which is driven by the second servo motor 120 via the reduction gear device 121. A steel belt 137 is stretched between the driving pulley 136 and the driven pulley 118. The steel belt 137 is an endless loop of SK hardened steel. The steel belt 137 is formed with vertically aligned pairs of through holes 138. Two pairs of holes 138 are spaced precisely halfway around the loop 137, as shown in Fig. 6. A fastener plate 139 is attached to each of the pulleys 118, 136 via the pairs of holes 138. The fastener plates 139 are slightly narrower than the dimension between the flanges of the driving and driven pulleys 136 and 118. A pair of recesses 141 are formed in the outer periphery of the fastener plates 139 opposite the holes 138. A pair of holes 140 pass through each fastener plate 139 Stow the bottoms of the recesses 141.The through holes 140 are respectively aligned with the through holes 138. The inner face of the fastener plate 139 opposing the steel belt 137 has a radius of curvature smaller than the outer radius of the pulleys 136 and 118. Therefore, the inner face of the fastener plate 139 contacts the steel belt 137 along lines at its opposite edges to hold the steel belt 137 in place on the pulleys as explained below. The holes 138 and 140 are also aligned with threaded holes 144 in the driving and driven pulleys 136 and 118. Fastening bolts 145 extend through the holes 138 and 140 and engage the corresponding threaded holes 144. By tightening the fastener bolts 145 firmly into the corresponding threaded holes 144, the fastener plates 139 are pulled tightly against the corresponding driving and driven pulleys 136 and 118. Thus, the fastener plates 139 clamp the steel belt 137 in place on the pulleys 136, 118 without applying force to the relatively weak section near the holes 138. As apparent from Fig. 8, the heads 145 a of the fastener bolt 145 protrude approximately halfway out of the fastener plates 139 The tension on the steel belt 137 is adjusted by means of the aforementioned adjusting bolt 135.First, the fastening bolts 134 which fix the housing 124 to the upper plate 111 of the first pivotal arm 103 are loosened so that the housing 124 can be moved along the longitudinal axis of the first pivotal arm 103. At this time, the fastening bolts 134 move along the slots 113.Then, the adjusting bolt 135 is turned in the loosening or tightening direction until the desired tension on the steel belt is obtained. After adjustment of the belt tension is completed, the fastening bolts 134 are again tightened to fix the housing 124 to the first pivotal arm 103. A third servo system 150 is mounted near the free end of the second pivotal arm 117. The third servo system 150 controls vertical positioning of the working end 151 of the robot. Alternatively, the third servo system 150 may control rotation of the working end, whereby the desired robot operation is actually executed. In the arrangement of Fig. 1, the third servo system 150 drives the vertically movable shaft 152 vertically to position a chuck 151 serving as the working end. The third servo system 150 also controls the gripping and releasing motions of the chuck 151 which cause a component to be set up for assembly to the workpiece at the working position. In the preferred embodiment, the controller 200 is programmed to control the first, second and third servo systems so as to move the working end from its initial position PO to the working position P3 along the trace illustrated in thick, solid lines in Fig. 9. In conventional robot operation, in order to move the working end of the robot from the initial position Po to the working position P3 around an obstacle 14, the working end is first moved to the intermediate point P1 along a straight path P0 P1. Then, the working end stops at the point P1 and thereafter is moved to a second intermediate point P2 along a straight path Pl p2. The working end is again stopped at the second intermediate point P2 and thereafter moved to the working poisition P3 along a straight path P2 p3. In the first zone Po Pl, the working end is first accelerated to a predetermined top speed within an acceleration zone a. After accelerating to the top speed, the velocity of the working end is held constant at the top speed throughout a constant speed zone b and then decelerated to rest at the intermediate point P1 within a deceleration zoneSimilarly, in the second zone P1 P2 and the third zone P2 P3, acceleration zones, Constant speed zones and deceleration zones are defined.This clearly lowers the average velocity of the working nd of the robot. According to the preferred embodiment, the working end is controlled by the controller such that it moves along a single non linear trace with no intermediate points at which the working end must come to rest. Fig. 10 is a circuit diagram of the robot control system which carrys out non stop, non linear robot positioning as set out above, according to the preferred embodiment of the invention. In Fig. 10, the controller 200 comprises CPU 202a connected to the keyboard unit 300 and the teaching box 400. The CPU 202a is also connected to servo control circuits 202b, 202c, 202r and 202z. The servo control circuit 202b is connected to the first servo motor 204 M1 which is, in turn, connected to the tachogenerator 107 TG and the encoder 106 PG . The tachogenerator 107 outputs a motor speed indicative signal 213f to the servo control circuit 202b as a feedback signal. On the other hand, the encoder 106 detects the angular position of the motor shaft and thus of the first pivotal arm 103. The encoder 106 outputs an angular position indicative signal as a feedback signal to CPU 202a.Similarly, the servo control circuit 202c is connected to the second servo motor 120 M2 which is, in turn, connected to the tachogenerator 123 TG and the encoder 122 PG . The tachogenerator 123 outputs a motor speed indicative signal 213f to the servo control circuit 202c as a feedback signal. The encoder 122 detects the angular position of the motor shaft and thus of the second pivotal arm 117. The encoder 106 outputs an angular position indicative signal as feedback signal to CPU 202a. The servo control circuit 202r is connected to a servo motor Mr which serves to control rotation of the working end. The servo motor Mr is connected to an encoder PGr r which detects the angular position of the servo motor Mr and thus of the working end, and outputs an angular position indicative signal to CPU 202a as a feedback signal. Also, the angular position indicative signal of the encoder PG r is send to the servo control circuit 202r as a feedback signal, via a frequency to voltage F V converter 202d. The servo motors Mr and the encoder PGr may be housed in a connector box 102a fixed to the base 102. The servo control circuit 202z is connected to a servo motor Mz which serves to. control vertical displacement of the working end. The servo motor Mz is connected to an encoder PG z which detects the angular position of the servo motor Mz and thus of the working end, and outputs an angular position indicative signal to CPU 202a as a feedback signal. Also, the angular position indicative signal of the encoder PG z is sent to the servo control circuit 202z as a feedback signal, via a frequency to voltage F V converter 202e. The servo motor Nz and the encoder PG z may be mounted near the free end of the second pivotal arm 117 as set forth above. The controller 200 further comprises a memory 204 which stores the initial position data of the working end of the robot, the working position data, and operation program input through the keyboard unit 300 and or the teaching box 400. CPU produces a first arm control signal consisting of an angular position control component and a speed control component, a second arm control signal consisting of an angular position control component and a speed control component, a working end rotation control signal and a working end vertical position control signal. The first arm control signal is sent to the servo control circuit 202b to control the driving direction and driving speed of the first servo motor 104. Similarly, the second arm control signal is sent to the servo control circuit 202c to control the driving direction and driving speed of the second servo motor 120. The F V converters 202d and 202e serve as means for producing motor speed representative signals as feedback signals for the servo control circuits 202r and 202z respectively. The servo control circuit 202r receives the working end rotation control signal and controls the angular position of the working end of the robot in accordance with a control signal from CPU 202a, described later. Similarly, the servo control circuit 202z receives the working end vertical position control signal from CPU 202a and controls the vertical position of the working end. According to the preferred embodiment of the invention, the controller 200 is programmed to move the working end along the thick, solid curve of Fig. 9. The path of the working end includes no intermediate points at which the working end must come to rest. Therefore, the working end moves through a single acceleration zone starting from the initial position Po, a single deceleration zone ending at the working position P3 and a single but rather long constant speed zone in between the acceleration zone and the deceleration zone. In order to facilitate better understanding of the control process according to the present invention, the control operations of the preferred embodiment of robot according to the invention will be described herebelow with reference to Figs. 9 and 11. In shifting the working end from its initial position PO to the working position P3 around the obstacle 14, the working end follows both non linear traces and straight stretches, as shown in Fig. 9. Position data for the initial position POT the working position P3 and intermediate points P1 and P2 in a unique three dimensional robot coordination system are received as operation parameters. An ideal or desired moving speed variation pattern for the working end determined on the basis of acceleration and deceleration characteristics of the servo motors is preset in the memory 204. Also, an initial lift distance through which the working end must be raised is set in the memory 204 through the keyboard unit 300 and or the teaching box 400. The final drop distance through which the working end is lowered to the working position is also set in the memory 204. The lift and drop distance values may be given coordinates of the points P4 and P5 at which lift ends and drop begins, respectively.CPU 204 derives the distances between the initial position PO and the intermediate point P1, between the intermediate point P2 and the working position P3 and between the intermediate points P1 and P2. On the basis of the distance data, the vertical moving speed variation pattern data, and the horizontal moving speed variation pattern data, CPU derives the trace, including an intial straight zone ZI Po to P4 , a first curved zone ZII P4 to P6 following the initial straight zone, an intermediate straight zone ZIII P6 to P7 , a second curved zone ZIV P7 to P5 and final straight zone ZV P5 to P3 .The lengths of each straight and curve zones ZI, ZII, Zill, ZIV and ZV vary according to the unique speed variation patterns of the specific robot and the preset position data. CPU 202a derives the trace of the working end in the three dimensional robot coordinate system, which trace is fully characterized by the straight and curved zones ZI, ZII, ZIII, ZIV and ZV, the speed and direction of the working end at specific points along the derived trace on the basis of the preset horizontal speed variation pattern and the preset vertical speed variation pattern. It should be noted that the speed and the direction at each specific point in the curve zones is given as a vector with a speed component in a first direction, e.g. along the x axla of the robot coordinate system and a speed component in a second direction, e.g.along the z axis. Although Fig. 9 shows movement of the working end in a two dimensional coordinate system defined by the x and z axes for simplification of the disclosure, the working end in practice moves through a three dimentional robot coordinate system. In this case, the vector is a composite of a speed component in the first direction, e.g. along the x axis of the robot coordinate system, a speed component in a second direction, e.g. along the z axis and a speed component in the third direction, e.g. along the y axis. The acceleration and deceleration characteristics of servo motors employed in the preferred embodiment of the industrial robot have been illustrated by the thin, solid curves V in Fig. 9. As seen from the curve V, the servo motor accelerates and decelerates in such a manner that, in the acceleration zone a, the motor speed increases non linearly and in fact can be expressed as a sin curve, and, in the deceleration zone, the motor speed also decreases non linearly along a sin curve. By utilizing servo motors with acceleration and deceleration characteristics which cause noln linear motor speed variation, smooth transistions between the acceleration zone and the constant speed zone, and between the constant speed zone and the deceleration zone can be achieved.In addition, the working end can be steadily lowered onto the working position by means of the characteristics V of Fig. 9. Based on t ne data as set out above, CPU 202a performs position anS speed control by deriving a first arm control signal, a second arm control signal, a working end rotation control signal and a working end vertical position control signal. CPU 202a also derives the coordinates flzr each boundary point between the straight zones and the curved zones and stores them in the memory 204. Then, the control program of Fig. 11 is periodically executed, e.g. every 10 msec. The flowchart of Fig. 1 L shows control operations actuating the working end through the initial straight zone ZI, the first curved Zcne ZII and the intermediate straight zone ZIII. As will be clear from the steps S1 and S2, as long as the working end remains in the intial straight zone ZI, CPU 202a outputs only the working end vertical position control signal to the servo control circuit 202z to vertically actuate the working end. The servo motor Mz is thus driven to accelerate the motor according to its own acceleration characteristics.During upward movement of the working end along the z axis, the target position data and target motor speed value are cyclically derived, e.g. every 10 msec. in step Sl. The target position data and target motor speed value are compared to the actual position data provided by the encoder PG z and the actual motor speed value represented by the output of the F V converter 202e. The servomotor Mz is controlled on the basis of the deviation between the target position data and the actual position data and the target motor speed value and the actual motor speed value. When the working end reaches the point PX, the first and or second arm control signals are output to activate the first and second servo motors 103 and 117.Therefore, the speed and direq n of the working end is given hereafter as the vector sum of the instantaneous speed in the z direction and the instantaneous speed in the x direction. During movement of the working end within the first curve zone ZII, target position data and the vector data representative of the speed and direction are derived at a step 53.On the basis of the derived target position data and the vector data, the servo motors are controlled to drive the working end along the determined trace, at a stfp SA. At a step S5, the instantaneous working end position is checked to see whether the working end has reached the point S6. Steps S3 through 55 are repeated until the working end reaches the point S6 Similarly to the control of the movement of the working end within the initial straight zone ZI, feed forward control is performed for accuracy of the position and speed control. When the working end reaches the point S6, the target position and target motor speed for the first and second servo motors 103 and 117 are derived at a step S6, and this step is repeated until the working end reaches point P7. As will be appreciated, position and speed control within the intermediate straight zone III, the second curved zone ZVI and the final straight zone ZV is similar to that set out above. As set forth above, according to the present invention, since the second servo motor 120 is mounted on the base 102, the load on the second pivotal arm 117 is significantly reduced. As a result, the inertia of the first and second pivotal arms is much smaller than in conventional robot systems in which the second servo motor is mounted at the free end of the first pivotal arm. This allows the second pivotal arm to be pivotted at higher speeds than in conventional robot systems.Therefore, the efficiency of the robot can be improved.Furthermore, since the robot is actuated between the initial position and the working position without stopping at an intermediate point or points, the total time requjired to move the working end from the initial position to the working position can be shortened significantly. This also serves helps improve robot efficiency. Therefore, the present invention fulfills all of the objects and advantages sought therefor. While the present invention has been disclosed in detail in terms of the specific embodiment of the invention, the invention should be appreciated as being capable of embodiment in various ways. Also, the specific embodiment disclosed hereabove can be modified in many ways without departing from the principle of the invention. Therefore, the invention should be understood to include all possible embodiments and modifications to the preferred embodiment encotpassed by the principles set out in the appended claims.
