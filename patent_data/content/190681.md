# Forming press of the pressure cell type.

## Abstract
A forming press of the pressure cell type comprising a press stand, a pressure cell arranged in the press stand with an elastic diaphragm 23 and a tray shaped tool carrying member, which is insertable into the press and in which a forming tool and a work piece are located. According to the invention the pressure cell is formed from a substantially plane diaphragm 22 , a substantially plane surface of the press plate, and a sealing ring 23 disposed around the periphery of the diaphragm to bridge a gap between the diaphragm and the press plate. The sealing ring 23 is U shaped with its flanges 23a, 23b directed inward towards the centre of the pressure cell. Inside the sealing ring 23 spring elements 30 , 32 are arranged to urge the flanges of the sealing ring outwardly to provide initial contact pressure with the diaphragm and the press plate, respectively.
