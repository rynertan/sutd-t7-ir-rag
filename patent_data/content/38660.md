# Casting method.

## Abstract
A method of casting a metal article of desired crystallog raphic characteristics includes using a starter element having those characteristics, and casting in a mold without signific ant bonding between the solidified cast metal and the starter element. The starter element sometimes a single crystal to provide a single crystal cast article is separated from the solidified cast body of metal and may subsequently be used in the casting of another article. In order to maximize the rate of heat transfer from the starter element and to tend to minimize bonding of the molten metal with the starter element, the starter element is advantageously located in a recess in a chill block, with an upper surface of the starter element level with an upper surface of the chill block. In order to retard formation of condensation and to prevent eroding of the metal of the starter element, one or more layers of metallic foil may be disposed between the starter element and the mold cavity.
