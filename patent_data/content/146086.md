# MICROWAVE BALUN FOR MIXERS AND MODULATORS

## Abstract
A microwave balun using TEM wave guides, consists of two second order reactance sections of electrical lengths equal to about a quarter of the wavelength of a radiofrequency signal comprising an unbalanced input port and a balanced output port. Each section I, II comprises two strips of micro strip like wave guides, placed in such a way above the ground plane being the bottom metallization 0 of the lower layered substrate 3 that one of the guides 1, 2 is on the top side of the lower substrate, and the other guide 1 , 2 placed there above is separated therefrom by the material volume of the upper layered substrate 4 and is on the top side of the upper substrate. The pair of guides, any one from each section, being the pair of input guides 1, 2 is connected with each other by two ends 12, 21 , while one of the two remaining ends 11 thereof is connected to the input port 10 , and the other one 22 is terminated for a radio frequency signal by a reflecting element. The second pair of the remaining wave guides 1 , 2 being the pair of output guides, forms with two ends 12 , 21 thereof, one from each section, a pair of output port terminals. Each of the remaining ends 22 , 11 of the pair of output guides is terminated for a radio frequency signal by a reflecting element, whereby phases of the said reflecting elements are dependent on the configuration choice of the input and the output ports and the phase choice of the reflecting element terminating the end of input guides, the opposite one to the in put. The cross section dimensions and material constants of materials used have the values dependent on the required broadband properties according to the set of transmission re flection parameters of the balun and the required input and output impedance. The balun design according to the invention is designed for uti lization within the frequency range of 1 18 GHz.
