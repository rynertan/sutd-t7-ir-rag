# Improved method and apparatus for wrapping machine.

## Abstract
A package is conveyed to a package elevator which elevates it into a film sheet stretched above the elevator. Side folding levers 100 and a coordinated rear folder 106 fold three sides of the film sheet about the package such that edges of first and second opposed sides 202 of the film sheet are overlapped by edges of a third or rear side 204 of the film sheet. The infolding of the third side 204 of the film sheet by the side underfolders 100 is delayed at the rear edge of the package by expanding the opening between the side underfolders 100 in that area. Thus, the rear underfold ing of the third side 204 commences substantially at the rear corners of the package to expand the underfolded third side 204 and ensure film overlap. The package is then pushed onto a conveyor to underfold the fourth side 206 of the film and entirely cover the underside of the package by overlapping edges of the folded sides 202, 204, 206 of the film sheet. The infolding is delayed by an improved side folding lever 100 having a curvilinear folding edge 112 with a notch 114 formed at its inner end and in substantial alignment with the rear edge of the largest packages to be wrapped using the folding lever 100 . Preferably, the notches 114 comprise curvilinear trailing edges which serve to tuck and roll the edges of infolded portions of the third or rear side 204 of the film sheet as it is rear underfolded.
