# Process for simultaneously detecting multiple antigens using dual sandwich immunometric assay.

## Abstract
At least two antigens in a sample may be detected using an immunometric dual sandwich assay containing an effec tive amount of at least one monoclonal antibody against each antigen, which antibodies are separately conjugated with the same or different signal moieties as labels, and an effective amount of at least one unlabeled monoclonal antibody against each antigen which unlabeled antibodies are immobilized on a single support. Preferably the anti bodies are all products of different cell lines and the antigens are prostatic acid phosphatase and prostate antigen.
