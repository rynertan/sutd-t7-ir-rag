## Description
PHOTOGRAPHIC RECORDING MATERIAL EMPLOYING A NONDIFFUSIBLE CYAN DYE RELEASING COMPOUND OR PRECURSOR THEREOF This invention relates to a photographic recording material employing a novel nondiffusible cyan dye releasing compound which, as a function of development of a silver halide emulsion layer, releases a diffusible cyan dye. The dye releasing compound can be premetallized or a metal complex of the released dye can be formed in an image receiving layer. U.S. Patent 4,142,891 relates to various nondiffusible azo dye releasing compounds including compounds having a releasable 6 arylazo 3 pyridinol dye moiety. However, these prior art dyes are not entirely suitable for commercial use due to their relatively broader band widths and unwanted absorption below 600nm. Cyan compounds in the 4,142,891 patent are obtained when the phenyl nucleus has a nitro group para to the azo linkage. In contrast, the compounds of the instant invention have a heterocyclic fused ring nucleus instead of a phenyl or naphthyl nucleus. In addition, the cyan dyes of this invention have excellent hues and less unwanted absorption below 600 nm than dyes shown in the 891 patent, as will be illustrated by comparative tests shown hereinafter. The object of this invention is to provide improved cyan dye releasing compounds containing chelating dye moieties, so that the dye which is released imagewise during processing, which can be premetallized or metallizable, can diffuse to an image receiving layer to form a metal complexed, dye transfer image having narrower bandwidth, minimum unwanted absorption outside the red region of the spectrum, better hue, rapid diffusion rate and shorter access time than those of the prior art, as well as good stability to heat, light and chemical reagents. A photographic recording material in accordance with this invention comprises at least one photosensitive silver halide emulsion layer having associated therewith a dye image providing material comprising a nondiffusible compound containing a ballasted carrier moiety which is capable of releasing, under alkaline conditions, at least one diffusible cyan dye moiety comprising a 6 heterocyclylazo 3 pyridinol, said dye image providing material having the following formula EMI2.1 wherein a Y represents the atoms necessary to complete a 5 or 6 membered aromatic heterocyclic fused ring which can be unsubstituted or substituted b CAR represents a ballasted carrier moiety capable of releasing the diffusible cyan dye moiety as a function of development of the silver halide emulsion layer under alkaline conditions c R represents a hydroxy group, a salt thereof, or a hydrolyzable precursor thereof, or CAR which is linked to the dye moiety through an oxygen atom thereon and d n is 0, 1 or 2 with the proviso that when n is 0, then R is CAR which is linked to the dye moiety through an oxygen atom thereon. Typical aromatic heterocyclic fused rings which Y, and the ring to which Y is fused, can complete include quinoline, quinoxaline, benzimidazole or indolenine. Preferably, R is hydroxy and the abovedefined fused ring has an electron withdrawing substituent para to the azo group. This electronwithdrawing substituent can be nitro or S02J, wherein J is amino, aryloxy of from 7 to 12 carbon atoms, alkyl or alkoxy having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms or aryl of 6 to 10 carbon atoms. In a particular preference R is hydroxy, Y represents the atoms necessary to complete a quinoline ring having aCOOH group in the 2 position, the pyridine ring has an amino group in the 2 position, n is 1 and CAR is attached to the pyridine ring. As stated above, R can be a hydroxy group, a salt thereof, such as a sodium salt or a tetramethylammonium salt, a hydrolyzable precursor thereof orCAR. Hydrolyzable precursors of a hydroxy group include acetate, benzoate, pivalate, carbamates, an acyloxy group having the formula OCOR1, OCOOR1 or OC0N R1 2, wherein each R1 is an alkyl group having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl or butyl, or an aryl group having from 6 to 12 carbon atoms, such as phenyl, or any of the blocking groups which can be cleaved by an intramolecular nucleophilic displacement reaction, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,310,612. When R is CAR or a hydrolyzable precursor of a hydroxy group, the absorption of the dye releasing compound is shifted out of the red region of the spectrum. As a result of this shift the dyereleasing compound can be incorporated in the silver halide emulsion layer. In another embodiment CAR can have attached thereto two azo dye moieties in which case two dye moieties will be released from one CAR moiety. Substituents can be present in the two rings illustrated above. These include alkyl or acyl of 1 to 6 carbon atoms, aryl of 6 to 10 carbon atoms, aralkyl of 7 to 12 carbon atoms, amino, alkylsulfonyl, alkoxy wherein the alkyl moiety has from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, halogens such as chloro or bromo, morpholino, phenylsulfamoyl, solubilizing groups such as sulfonamido, sulfamoyl, carboxy, sulfo or hydrolyzable precursors thereof. In another preferred embodiment the dyereleasing compounds described above can be premetallized, i.e., they can comprise a coordination complex of the nondiffusible compounds and a polyvalent metal ion. In a further preferred embodiment of the invention, the coordination complex comprises a 2 1 complex of the nondiffusible compound and a divalent or trivalent hexacoordinate metal ion. Such metal ions include zinc II , nickel II , copper 11 , cobalt II and cobalt III . Especially good results are obtained with nickel CII ions. There is great latitude in selecting a CAR moiety which is attached to the dye releasing compounds described above. Depending upon the nature of the ballasted carrier selected, various groups may be needed to attach or link the carrier moiety to the dye. Such linking groups are considered to be a part of the CAR moiety in the above definition. It should also be noted that, when the dye moiety is released from the compound, cleavage may take place in such a position that part or all of the linking group, if one is present, and even part of the ballasted moiety, may be transferred to the image receiving layer along with the dye moiety. In any event, the dye nucleus as shown above can be thought of as the minimum which is transferred.

When R is CAR, linkage must be to the dye moiety through an oxygen atom thereon, so that a pyridinol is released from the nondiffusible compound under alkaline conditions. Such CARs are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent 4,139,379 noted above. Representative dye releasing compounds useful in this invention include the following Metallizable CompoundsEMI6.1 EMI7.1 EMI8.1 EMI9.1 EMI10.1 EMI11.1 EMI12.1 EMI13.1 EMI14.1 EMI15.1 EMI16.1 A process for producing a photographic transfer image in color utilizing photographic recording materials as described herein comprises a treating such a recording material having a metallizable dye releasing compound with an alkaline processing composition in the presence of a silver halide developing agent to effect development of each exposed silver halide emulsion layer b the dye releasing compound then releasing the diffusible azo dye imagewise as a function of the development of each of the silver halide emulsion layers c at least a portion of the imagewise distribution of the azo dye diffusing to a dye imagereceiving layer and d contacting the imagewise distribution of azo dye with metal ions, thereby forming a metal complexed azo dye transfer image. The cyan azo dye moiety which is released from the metallizable dye releasing compounds described above is a tridentate ligand. This ligand will form a coordination complex in the image receiving layer with polyvalent metal ions.The metal ions can be present in the image receiving layer itself or in a layer adjacent thereto.Alternatively, the image receiving layer can be contacted with metal ions in a bath after diffusion of the dye has taken place. Metal ions most useful in the invention are those which are essentially colorless when incorporated into the image receiving element, are inert with respect to the silver halide layers, react readily with the released dye to form a complex of the desired hue, are tightly coordinated to the dye in the complex, have a stable oxidation state, and form a dye complex which is stable to heat, light and chemical reagents. Good results are obtained with polyvalent metal ions such as copper 11 , zinc II , nickel it , platinum it , palladium II , cobalt II and cobalt III ions. It is believed that the coordination complex which can be formed from the tridentate, metallizable azo dye ligand has the following structural formula EMI18.1 wherein Y is as defined above Me is metal and Lig is one or more ligand groups, depending upon the coordination number of the metal ion, such as H2O, C1 or pyridine, a second dye moiety or a part of a polymer. A divalent metal ion in solution always has a number of ligand groups attached to it depending upon its coordination number and the relative reactivity of various ligand groups such as water, ammonia, chloride, pyridine or acetate, which may be in the solution environment of the metal ion.These ligands can be displaced by a tridentate azo dye ligand which forms a more stable complex. Thus, in accordance with a preferred embodiment a photographic recording material is provided which comprises a support having thereon a coordination complex of a polyvalent metal ion and a compound having the formula EMI18.2 wherein Y is as previously described. The photographic recording material usually contains a photographic mordant or image receiving layer to bind the dye or coordination complex thereto. After processing the photographic recording material described above, there remains in it after transfer has taken place an imagewise distribution of azo dye in addition to developed silver. A color image comprising residual nondiffusible compound is obtained in this recording material if the residual silver and silver halide are removed by any conventional manner well known to those skilled in the photographic art, such as a bleach bath, followed by a fix bath or a bleach fix bath. Such a retained dye image should normally be treated with metal ions to metallize the dyes to increase their light fastness and shift their spectral absorption to the intended region. The imagewise distribution of azo dye may also diffuse out of the recording material into these baths, if desired, rather than to an image receiving element.If a negative working silver halide emulsion is employed a positive color image, such as a reflection print, a color transparency or a motion picture film, is produced in this manner. If a direct positive silver halide emulsion is employed a negative color image is produced. The photographic recording material in the above described process is treated in any manner with an alkaline processing composition to effect or initiate development. The recording material may also comprise a dye image receiving layer. The photographic recording material preferably contains the alkaline processing composition and means containing same for discharge within the material.There can be employed, for example, a rupturable container which is adapted to be positioned during processing so that a compressive force applied to the container by pressure applying members, such as would be found in a camera designed for in camera processing, will effect a discharge of the container s contents within the recording material. The dye image receiving layer may itself contain metal ions or the metal ions may be present in an adjacent layer, so that the tridentate, metallizable azo dye ligand which is released will form a coordination complex therewith. The dye thus becomes immobilized in the dye image receiving layer and metallized at the same time. Alternatively, the dye image in the dye image receiving layer may be treated with a solution containing metal ions to effect metallization. The formation of the coordination complex shifts the absorption of the dye to the desired hue, usually to longer wavelengths, which have a different absorption than that of the initial dye releasing compound. If this shift is large enough, then the dye releasing compound may be incorporated in a silver halide emulsion layer without adversely affecting its sensitivity. Otherwise the dye releasing compound can be contained in a layer contiguous to the silver halide emulsion layer. Either conventional negative working or direct positive silver halide emulsions can be employed. The concentration of the dye releasing compounds that are employed in the present invention may be varied over a wide range, depending upon the particular compound employed and the results which are desired. For example, the dye releasing compounds may be coated in layers at a concentration of 0.1 to 3 gim2 by using coating solutions containing between 0.5 and 8 percent by weight of the dye releasing compound distributed in a hydrophilic film forming natural material or synthetic polymer, such as gelatin or polyvinyl alcohol, which is adapted to be permeated by aqueous alkaline processing composition. Preferably, the silver halide developer or electron transfer agent ETA employed in the process becomes oxidized upon development and reduces silver halide to silver metal. The oxidized developer than cross oxidizes the dye releasing compound. The product of cross oxidation then undergoes alkaline hydrolysis, thus releasing an imagewise distribution of diffusible azo dye which then diffuses to the receiving layer to provide the dye image. The diffusible moiety is transferable in alkaline processing composition either by virtue of its selfdiffusivity or by its having attached to it one or more solubilizing groups, for example, a carboxy, sulpho, sulphonamido, hydroxy or morpholino group. The term nondiffusing used herein has the meaning commonly applied to the term in photography and denotes materials that, for all practical purposes, do not migrate or wander through organic colloid layers, such as gelatin, in the photographic recording materials of the invention in an alkaline medium and preferably when processed in a medium having a pH of 11 or greater. The same meaning is to be attached to the term immobile . The term diffusible has the converse meaning and denotes materials having the property of diffusing effectively through the colloid layers of the photographic recording materials in an alkaline medium. Mobile has the same meaning as diffusible . The term associated therewith is intended to mean that the materials can be in either the same or different layers, so long as the materials are accessible to one another. The following examples are provided to further illustrate the invention.Example 1 Released Dyes Spectra, Light Stability and Dye Diffusion Tests A receiving element was prepared comprising a poly ethylene terephthalate film support having thereon a nickel sulfate hexahydrate 9.58 g m2 gelatin 1.08 g m2 metal complexing layer, and a poly 4 vinylpyridine gelatin mordant layer each at 2.15 g m2 . An alternative receiving element was used with the premetallized dye complexes. It comprised a poly ethylene terephthalate film support having thereon a layer of gelatin 1.1 git2 and a mordant layer of poly styrene co l vinylimidazole co 3benzyl l vinylimidazolium chloride 50 40 10 4.5 g m2 and gelatin 2.2 g m2 . These receiving elements were immersed in alkaline solutions of the azo dyes listed below inTable I. The elements were removed from the dye solutions, washed in distilled water, placed in a pH 7.0 buffer solution and dried. Transmission spectra obtained on each receiving element of the mordanted dyes were normalized by computer to a density of 1.0. The may at maximum density, along with the half bandwidth HBW , the wavelength range of the curve at half the maximum density, are recorded inTable I. A narrow HBW generally designates a purer hue. The above receiving elements at pH 7 were then subjected to 21 days irradiation by a high intensity daylight HID , 6000W Xenon arc lamp, each element receiving 50,000 lux through a Wratten 2B ultraviolet filter at 380C. The percent fade represents the loss in density at AmaX after irradiation. Some of the released dyes in Table I were also subjected to a dye diffusion test. The test involved dissolving the dye in a viscous composition prepared as noted below and transferring it through a receiving element which contains an opaque and reflecting layer in addition to the mordant layer.The receiving element for this test had the following composition coverages are parenthetically given in g m2 A transparant poly ethyleno terephthelate film support coated with 1 a mordant layer of poly styrene co N vinylbenzyl N benzyl N,N dimethylammonium chloride co di vinylbenzene weight ratio 49.5 49.5 1 2.28 and gelatin 2.28 2 an opaque layer of carbon black 1.88 in gelatin 1.23 3 a reflecting layer of titanium dioxide 16.1 in gelatin 2.63 and 4 an overcoat layer of gelatin 4.3 .Dye Diffusion Test Approximately 0.075 mmol of the unmetallized released dye was dissolved in 10 ml of 0.125 N potassium hydroxide. After the dye was completely dissolved, 20 ml of a viscous composition was added.The resulting solution, stirred for at least 20 minutes, was 0.0025 M in dye at a pH of 13.4. The viscous composition was prepared from 46.2 g potassium hydroxide and 54 g carboxymethylcellulose dissolved in 1200 ml water. The dye solution was then spread between the image receiving element and a clear polyester cover sheet. This sandwich was then passed between spaced rollers so that the gap containing the viscous solution had a thickness of 102 pm. Measurement of the rate of dye diffusion was commenced at the point at which half of the sandwich, or laminate, had passed through the rollers. The appearance of dye on the mordant was measured at A as diffuse reflection density vs. time. The reflection density was converted to transmission density. A plot of transmission density, which is proportional to concentration vs.time was derived. Calculation was made of the value of t 1 2 of dyttransfer,the time in seconds required to obtain one half of the maximum transmission density. Various results from fade tests and or from dye diffusion tests are reported in Table I. Table IReleased Dyes EMI25.1 Spectrum Dye of Ni Dye Diffu Complex sion max HBW t1 2Cmpd.
