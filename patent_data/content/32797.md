## Description
IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO CONVEYOR BELTS This invention relates to conveyor belts of the honeycomb type comprising a series of transverse rods, and a plurality of open work belt sections extending between and pivoted to the transverse rods,each belt section being of cranked or wavey form comprising a series of longitudinal components which extend longitudinally of the belt, are spaced apart transversely of the belt, have apertures therein through which the transverse rods pass, and are joined at their ends by two rows of cross components hereinafter referred to as main cross components extending transversely alongside the transverse rods, and adjacent belt sections longit udinally of the conveyor belt intermeshing with one another at the transverse rods. Such conveyor belts are hereinafter referred to as of the honeycomb type described . When the conveyor belt is in operation the substantial stresses to which the belt sections are subjected can cause them to distort and the distortion can ultimately lead to fracture of the belt sections and breakdown of the conveyor belt. Further, the distortion can result in additional loading being imposed on the drive to the conveyor belt which may cause a failure in the drive. The open work structure of the belt sections does not readily lend itself to reinforcement, and therefore hitherto the serviceability of the belt sections has depended largely on the ability of the materials used in the manufacture of the belt sections to tolerate distortion. It is the primary object of the present invention to provide a conveyor belt in which the belt sections have improved resistance to distortion in use. The present invention consists in a conveyor belt of the honeycomb type described wherein the belt sections have additional cross components which extend between and are joined to the longitudinal components, and which are spaced from, and at the opposite sides of the transverse rods to, the main cross components joined to the ends of the longitudinal components. The additional cross components strengthen the belt sections laterally and thereby increase the resistance to bending of the main cross components joined to the ends of the longitudinal components, both from longitudinal forces on the belt which tend to urge the longitudinal components together and from relative movement between adjacent belt sections and between the belt sections and their supporting transverse rods when the conveyor belt travels round lateral curves. The additional cross components also relieve the joints between the longitudinal components and the main cross components of at least some of the stresses to which joints of the conventional conveyor belts of the honeycomb type described have been prone, and which have made the joints particular points of weakness in the belt sections. Whilst the belt sections are strengthened by the additional cross components they also retain the essential open work structure. Conveyor belts of the honeycomb type described are used to a large extent in the food preparation industry. The open work structure of the belt sections is most advantageous in such use because it permits water and other liquids, and solid matter, to drain and fall away freely from the belt, and it facilitates cleansing of the belt so that the standards of hygiene required in the handling of foodstuffs can be complied with satisfactorily. The conveyor belt in accordance with the present invention is suitable for such use. Any matter which may collect on the transverse rods, or between the transverse rods and the main and additional cross components can be cleaned off readily. The belt sections may be formed as plastics mouldings, each section conveniently being a unitary moulding including the additional cross components. Alternatively the belt sections may be made of metal, for example continuous metal strip bent to form the longitudinal components and the main cross components joining the ends of the longitudinal components and further strips secured, as by welding for example, between the longitudinal components to provide the additional cross components. An embodiment of the present invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is a plan view of part of the length of a conveyor belt, and Figure 2 is an enlarged plan view of a belt section of the conveyor belt. The conveyor belt comprises a series of transverse metal rods 1 and a plurality of moulded plastics belt sections 2 spanning and pivoted to the rods. Adjacent belt sections 2 longitudinally of the conveyor belt intermesh at the transverse rods 1. Each belt section extends across the full width of the belt. The belt sections 2 each comprise two parallel rows of main cross components 3 joined by a series of integral longitudinal components 4 extending lengthwise of the belt, such that the belt section is of cranked form.Joined at their ends integrally to the longitudinal components are additional cross components 5 which are spaced from, and are parallel to, the main cross components 3. The longitudinal components 4 are of oblong rectangular cross section disposed on edge, as are the additional cross components, in the normal load supporting position of use of the belt section. The main cross components have a narrow generally D shaped crosssection, their rounded sides 6 facing outwardly away from the other row of main cross components of the belt section and the adjacent additional cross components.The longer dimensions of the cross sections of the longitudinal components, main and additional cross components are all the same, and opposite ends of the cross sections of the components lie in common planes. The portions 7 of each longitudinal component 4 between the main cross components 3 and the adjacent additional cross components 5 extend at right angles to those components. Each main cross component, the adjacent additional cross component and the portions 7 of the longitudinal components between the two cross components therefore define in combination an elongated, rectangular configuration. The portion 8 of each longitudinal component between the additional cross components 5 joined to the longitudinal component extends obliquely to the additional cross components such that the oblique portions 8 of the two longitudinal components to which an additional cross component are joined extend divergently away from the additional cross component.The rectangular configurations described and the divergency of the oblique portions 8 of the longi tudinal components enable adjacent belt sections lengthwise of the assembled conveyor belt to intermesh closely at the transverse rods. In each of the portions 7 of the longitudinal components 4 of a belt section between the main cross components and the adjacent additional cross components there is an aperture 9. The transverse rods to which the belt section is pivoted pass through the apertures 9 and the spaces 10 defined between the main and additional cross components, that is within the rectangular configurations described. The apertures 9 are of diameters complementary to the transverse rods which fit freely in the apertures. The spaces 10 are only slightly wider than the diameters of the transverse rods so that the main and additional cross components lie close to the transverse rods. At the free ends of the longitudinal components which are at the sides of the belt section and define the longitudinal sides of the conveyor belt, there are shortened main and additional cross components 11 and 12 respectively. The spaces between these shortened cross components 11, 12 are stopped off at the ends remote from the side longitudinal components by webs 13 joined integrally to the cross components. Thus the shortened main and additional cross components and the webs 13 define sockets 14. The sockets 14 receive the ends of the transverse rods which are entered into the sockets through apertures 15 in the side longitudinal components. The engagement of the ends of the transverse rods in the sockets retains the transverse rods to the belt sections. Lateral movement of the transverse rods relative to the belt sections is prevented by the webs 13. There is sufficient flexibility in the side longitudinal components to permit their free ends to be deflected laterally outwardly for the ends of the transverse rods to be inserted in the sockets 14. The conveyor belt is driven by sprockets, not shown, at spaced positions across the width of the belt, the sprockets being mounted on a common drive shaft.The rounded sides 6 of the main cross components are engaged by the sprockets and nestle closely between the teeth of the sprocket. When the belt is to travel a sinuous path in use the apertures in the longitudinal components are elongated, and the spacing of the additional cross components from the main cross components is increased, so as to allow the required relative movement between adjacent belt sections, and between the belt sections and transverse rods, to permit the belt to pass round the lateral curves. Whilst the additional cross components of the belt sections in the embodiment described have cross sections similar to those of the longitudinal components and of the same longitudinal dimensions as the longitudinal and main cross components, the additional cross components are not limited to being of those cross sections and dimensions. They may be of other cross sections and dimensions but it is advantageous for the components to have surfaces in the planes of those surfaces of the longitudinal components and main cross components which form supporting surfaces of the belt sections in use, thereby to provide further supporting surfaces on the belt sections.
