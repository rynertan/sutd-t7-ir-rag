# Coupling pipe part for interconnecting corrugated pipe parts and pipe connection.

## Abstract
Plastics coupling pipe part 1 for connecting corrugated plastic pipe 2 , which coupling pipe part comprises abut ment projections 3 and a radially resilient displaceable lip 6 carrying an inwardly directed cam 4 . The lip 6 is surrounded by openings 21 delimited by a rectangular incision 11 in the plastics pipe. The transition part 7 connecting the lip 6 with the pipe wall has a smaller width than the end edge 8 of the lip. In a pipe connection with such a coupling pipe part the coupling cam 4 engages a flank 9 of a wave valley of a corrugated pipe 2 .
