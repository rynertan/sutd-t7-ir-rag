# DISPLAY SYSTEM AND METHOD

## Abstract
A graphic display system and method in which a large number of object elements can be stored in a pattern memory and called up for display in real time is described. The system comprises A. a pattern memory A for storing data representing a plurality of object elements B. a system memory B for storing data identifying the plurality of object elements and data comprising instructions defining the nature and location of representations of the ob ject elements or parts thereof C. a third memory C for storing instructions as to the identity, nature and location of display of desired ones of the preselected object elements D. a buffer memory F for storing data corresponding to the desired representation of at least a portion of the scene E. first data processing means D operatively connected between said system memory B , the pattern memory A and the third memory for transferring data therebetween F. second data processing means E operatively connect ed between the third memory B , the pattern memory A and the buffer memory F for depositing in the buffer memory data from the pattern memory in response to instructions from the third memory and G. display means for causing the data in the buffer memory F to produce a display on the screen corresponding to the desired representation.
