# Data processing device for computed tomography system.

## Abstract
A data processing device 10 applied to a computed tomography system which examines a living body 18 utilizing radiation of X rays 14 is disclosed. The X rays 14 which have penetrated the living body 18 are converted into electric signals in a detecting section 20 . The electric signals are acquired and converted from an analog form into a digital form in a data acquisition section 22 , and then supplied to a matrix data generating section 30 included in the data processing device 10 . By this matrix data generating section 30 are generated matrix data which correspond to a plurality of projection data. These matrix data are supplied to a partial sum producing section 32 . The partial sums respectively corresponding to groups of the matrix data are calculated in this partial sum producing section 32 and then supplied to an accumulation section 34 . In this accumulation section 34 , the final value corresponding to the total sum of the matrix data is calculated, whereby the calculation for image reconstruction is performed.
