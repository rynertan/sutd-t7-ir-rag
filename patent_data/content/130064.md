## Description
Improvements in and relating to an enzymatic detergent additive, a detergent, and a washing method The field of enzymatic additives has been rapidly growing during the last decades. Reference is mode to e.g. the article How Enzymes Cot into Detergents , Vol. 12,.Developments in Industrial Microbiology, a publication of the Society for Industrial Microbiology, American Institute of Biological Sciences, Washington, D.C. 1971, by Claus Dambmann, Poul Holm, Villy Jensen, and Mogens Hilmer Nielsen. The most common enzymatic detergent additive is a proteolytic additive, but also lipolytic detergent additives are described, e.g. in U.S. Patent No. 4,011,116, column 4, line 65 to column 5, line 68, and British Patent No. 1,293,613, page 2, lines 6 to 29. Also, a comprehensive review article of lipases as detergent additives written by Hans Andree et al. is to be found in the Journal of Applied Biochemistry, 2, 218 229 1980 , entitled Lipases as Detergent Components . If the washing process is conducted at high temperature and high alkalinity, the fat containing dirt will be dissolved by saponification. However, due to the energy crisis, low temperature washing processes around 600C and below are generally preferred, and at these low temperatures the known lipases are able to dissolve only a part of the fat containing dirt. The efficiency of lipolytic enzymatic detergent additives can conveniently be measured by means of EMPA Eidgen√∂ssische MateriolprUfungsund Versuchsanstalt, St. Galleon, Switzerlond swatches Nos. 101 olive oil cotton and 102 olive oil wool by odaptation of the procedure described in British Patent No. 1,36 1 ,386 especially poges 4 and 7 and US patent No. 3,723,250 especially ccl. 15 19 . In this way it appears that the enzymes known as lipolytic detergent added tives are rather unsatisfactory in the sense that they exhibit an un satisfactorily low lipolytic cleaning efficiency, as reflected in the low value of the differential remittance value iSR at economically reasonable lipase activities in the washing solution.Thus, a need exists for a lipolytic detergent additive which exhibits a considerably better lipolytic cleaning efficiency, corresponding to a considerably higher differential remittance value, AR, at economically reasonable lipase activities in the washing solution.Now, according to the first aspect of the invention, a lipolytic detergent additive has been found which exhibits a considerably better lipolytic cleaning efficiency, corresponding to a considerably higher differential remittance value, AR, at economically reasonable lipase activities in the washing solution this lipolytic detergent additive being characterized by the fact that the lipase is producible by means of a lipase producing strain of rusarium oxvsDorum. The definition of the species Fusarium oxvsPorum has changed somewhat during the last decades. However, for the purposes of this invention the definition of the species Eusarium oxvsporum is the definition set forth in The Genus Fusarium , C. Booth, CMI, 1971.In relation to certain strains of Fusarium oxvsPorum a lipase formation is described, vide e.g. Agric. Biol. Chem. 43 10 1979 , 2126,Table I where a Fusarium lini lipase is indicated according to the above definition of Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium lini now belongs to Fusarium oxysnorum , and Indian Journal of Experimental Biology,Vol. 11 1973 , p. 37 39 with the title Lipids and Lipase Activity in Strains of Fusarium vasinfectum according to the above defini titan of Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium vasinfectum now belongs to Fusa rium oxysporum .Some strains belonging to Fusarium oxYsPorum are poor lipase produ ers. For the purposes of this invention, a lipase producing strain of Fusarlum oxvsnorum is defined as a strain which produces more than 10 LU ml the LU being the Lipase Units defined later in this specification under the following conditions A substrate intended for shaking flasks is prepared with the follows ing ingredients in grams per litre Soy bean meal ......... 45 Glucose ............... 70 KH2P04 2 Na2HP04 3 Soy oil ............... 5.Sterilization took place at 121 C for 40 minutes. A 500 ml Erl nmeyer flask with 100 ml of substrate was inoculated with spores from an agar slant previously inoculated with the strain of Fusarium oxyspcrum to be tested for lipase production. The flasks were shaken at 230 rpm and at 300C for 5 days whereafter the lipase yield was determined. Reference is made to example 29.Thus, it has surprisingly been found that the detergent additive according to the invention exhibits a drastically improved lipolytic cleaning efficiency which will appear from documentation presented later in this specification.With regard to the Fusarium oxvsorum strains DSM 2672, ATCC 7808,CBS 620.72, CBS 645.78, and CBS 794.70, it has been found that the average value of the pH activity optimum is around 9 11, and that the 0 average temperature activity optimum is around 35 50 C time of analysis 20 minutes . On the basis of crossed immunoelectrophoresis with antibodies produced from the lipase from DSM 2672 it appears that the lipases originating from the above indicated five strains are identical or partially identical. On the basis of the above findings the conclusion may be drawn that the active component of, the enzymatic detergent additive according to the invention is a group of closely related lipases. The lipase activity is determined according to the NOVO method for determination of lipase activity. This method is based on the hydrolysis of tributyrin by the enzyme. The butyric acid liberated is determined by titration with NaOH. One NOVO Lipase Unit LU is the amount of enzyme which1 in a pH stat and under the standard conditions stated below, liberates titratable butyric acid equivalent to 1 pmol of NaOH per minute. Standard Conditions Temperature ...... 30.00C pH 7.0 Reaction time .... 20 minutes Substrate ........ tributyrin. Further details of this method are described in the leaflet AF 95 4 dated 1982 08 18, which is available on request from NOVO INDUSTRIA S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark.In a specially preferred embodiment of the enzymatic detergent additive according to the invention, the lipase producing strain of Fusarium oxesDorum is DSM 2672. The strain Fusarium sP. DSM 2672 has been classified as Fusarium oxYsPorum Schlecht. ex Fries, emend. Snyder BR Hansen. The morphological properties of the strain DSM 2672 Fusarium oxvsDorum exactly correspond to the description of the species description of Fusarium oxvsporum in the Genus Fusarium, C. Booth, CMI, 1971. The pH activity curve of the lipase has been drawn up, the lipase activity being measured according to AF 95 4 GB, modified by adjustment of the pH value of the substrate to 4, 5, and 6, and 8, 9, and 10 besides the normal pH value of the substrate of 7.Due to the fact that tributyrin is decomposed without lipase at high pH values, the pH curve is corrected for such autodecomposition. Hereby a pH activity optimum of around pH 10 has been found. The stability of the enzyme is excellent over a wide pH interval, inasmuch as more than 80X residual activity after 18 hours can be observed in the pH interval of 4.5 11 at 50C and in the pH interval of 5 10 at 250C. Also, the temperature optimum of the lipase activity is around 400C. The enzyme is stable up to 400C for 30 minutes, which is very advantageous in relation to the previously mentioned low temperature washing processes at around 600C and below.In a specially preferred embodiment of the enzymatic detergent additive according to the invention, the additive is provided as a non dusting granulate. These granulates can be produced in several different ways. Reference can be made to GB patent No. 1,362,365 which describes the production of enzyme containing granulates used as detergent additives by means of an apparatus comprising an extruder and a spheronizer sold as MARUMERIZER , , and to US patent No. 4,106,991 which describes the production of enzyme containing granulates used as detergent additives by means of a drum granulator.In a specially preferred embodiment of the enzymatic detergent additive according to the invention, the additive is provided as a liquid with an enzyme stabilizer. The stabilizer can be propylene glycol or other agents known as stabilizers for enzyme solutions. Liquid detergents exhibit a growing popularity due to the ease of application.In a specially preferred embodiment of the enzymatic detergent additive according to the invention, the lipase activity is between about 20,000 and about 100,000 LU g of additive. In this manner, a convenient lipase activity is generated in the washing solution when the detergent additive is added to the detergent in an amount of 0.2 2 g 100 g of detergent, and when the detergent is added to the washing solution in an amount of 1 5 g of detergentll of washing solution.In a specially preferred embodiment of the enzymatic detergent additive according to the invention, the additive contains a proteolytic enzyme besides the lipase. Surprisingly it has been found that the proteolytic detergent additive does not break down the protein lipase, either in the additive, in the detergent, or in the washing solution. Thus, the proteolytic and the lipolytic detergent additives are compatible, and it has been found that this detergent additive has a very high cleaning efficiency, resulting in a very high AR value. The proteolytic enzyme ALCALASE commat from NOVO INDUSTRI A S, manufactured microbially by means of Bacillus licheniformis, can be used with superior results.The mixed enzymatic additive can be prepared either by mixing a previously prepared granulate of proteinase with a previously prepared granulate of lipase1 or by mixing a concentrate of proteinase with a concentrate of lipase and then introducing this mixture into a granulating device, together with the usual granulating, aids.In a specially preferred embodiment of the enzymatic detergent additive according to the invention, the proteolytic activity is between about 0.5 and about 3.0 Anson Units g of additive. In this manner, a convenient proteolytic activity is generated in the washing solution when the detergent additive is added to the detergent in an amount of 0.2 2 g 100 g of detergent, and when the detergent is added to the washing solution in an amount of 1 5 g of detergent l of washing solution.The second aspect of the invention comprises a detergent with an enzymatic detergent addictive, the active component of which is mi crobially produced lipase, wherein the enzymatic detergent additive is the enzymatic detergent additive according to the invention.In a specially preferred embodiment of the enzymatic detergent additive according to the invention, the detergent contains the enzymatic detergent additive according to the invention in an amount of between 0.2 and 2.0t w w. In this manner, a reasonable balance between enzyme action and the action of the other detergent ingredients is generated. The third aspect of the invention comprises a washing process in which the detergent used is the detergent according to the invention, and in which the pH is between 7 and 11, and the temperature tis below 60 C. In a specially preferred embodiment of the enzymatic detergent additive according to the. invention, the washing solution contains the detergent according to the invention in an amount of between 1 and 5 g l of washing solution. In this manner, a convenient enzyme activity is generated in the washing solution, i.e. typically between 1,000 and 5b,000 LU l of washing solution. Under these circumstances, very high AR values are obtained for usual washing times, i.e.around 20 minutes.The invention will be illustrated by the following examples. Example l This example illustrates the production in shake flasks of the active component in the enzymatic detergent additive according to the invention. The substrate consists of the following ingredients in grams per liter. Soy bean meal 50 Glucose 50 KH2P04 2 Na2HP04 3 Soy oil 1 Sterilization took place at 1210C for 40 minutes. A 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask with 100 ml substrate was inoculated with 107 spores from an agar slant previously inoculated with Fusarium oxysporum DSM 2672. The flasks were shaken at 230 rpm and at 250 300 for 2 5 days. The yield was 30 80 LU ml.Example 2 This example and examples 3 15 illustrate the production of the active component in the enzymatic detergent additive according to the invention in a 2 litre laboratory fermentor.

The temperature was maintained at 300C.Fermentation was maintained for 100 hours, during which time the pH value rose from 6.3 to 8.5. The supernatant was analysed, and the lipase activity was found to be 90 LU ml. A series of experiments were performed in the same manner as indicated in example 2, except for the temperature, vide the following tableExample No. 3 4 5 6 7Temperature in fermentor, OC 28 30 32 34 36LU ml of supernatant 60 90 125 140 60 From the above table it appears that the optimum temperature is around 340C. In order to investigate the influence of pH two new experiments were performed at 340C and as indicated in example 6, except for pH in no one of the two experiments pH was controlled during the first 24 hours of the fermentation in the fermentor in the first experiment example 8 the pH was maintained at 6.5 by means of H3PO4 after the first 24 hours of the fermentation in the fermentor, and in the second experiment exampMeg VtSe pH was not monitored during the entire fermentation time. The results appear from the below indicated table.Example No 8 9Temperature in fermentor, C 34 34 after 24 hours maintained at 6.5 x no no regulation x LU ml of supernatant 180 140 From the above table it appears that the lipase yield is improved if the pH value is monitored in the manner indicated. In order to investigate the influence of the degree of agitation three experiments were performed in the same manner as indicated in example 8 except for the degree of agitation the speed of the agitator was raised from 600 rpm to different levels during the entire fermentation time after the first 24 hours fermentation, vide the following table.

Corn steep liquor 7.2 kg Soy oil 1.5 Calcium carbonate 1.5 Pluronic 25 ml Water up to 290 1 The medium was sterilized at 121oC for 1 hour. A twelve liter solution containing 7.2 kg glucose and 7.2 g citric acid was sterilized at 1210C for 1 2 hour and added to the corn steep liquor mixture. After cooling to 300C the medium was inoculated with spores of DSM 2672 from a Fernbach flask containing yeast extract, phosphate, magnesium, glucose and agar and which had been incubated at 300C for 7 days. Aeration 300 1 min was started immediately, and stirring 250 rpm was initiated after 20 hours.The temperature was maintained at 300C and growth was maintained for 29 hours. 30 1 of this seed culture Mete transferred to the main fermentor containing Soy bean meal 15 kg KH2P04 0.6 Na2HPO4 12H20 1.2 Soy oil 3 Pluronic 25 ml Water to a volume of 275 liters. The medium was sterilized for 1 hour at 1210C. 15 kg glucose and 15 g citric acid in 25 1 water were sterilized separately at 121 C for 30 minutes and added to the soy bean meal mixture. Following the inoculation, aeration 300 1 min was started. Stirring was also started, and the velocity thereof was increased to 400 rpm during the first 10 hours of fermentation. The temperature was maintained at 340C. Fermentation was maintained for 60 hours, during which time the pH value rose from 6.64 to 8, and thereafter the tank was cooled and the mycelium separated by centrifugation. The supernatant liquid was analysed, and the lipase activity was found to be 90 LU ml.Example 17 This example illustrates the production of the active component in the enzymatic detergent additive according to the invention in a pilot plant fermentor.

The spores from the slant were suspended in sterilized skim milk, and the suspension was lyophilized in vials. The contents of one lyophilized vial was transferred to the Fernbach flask. The flask was then incubated for one week at 300C. A substrate with the following composition was prepared in a 500 liter seed fermentor CaC03 1.5 kg Glucose 7.2 kg Corn steep liquor 7.2 kg Antifoam agent Pluronics 30 ml Tap water was added to a total volume of around 240 liters. pH was adjusted to around 5.5 before addition of CaCO3. The substrate was steam sterilized in the seed fermentor for 1 hour at 1210C. Final volume before inoculation was around 300 liters.
