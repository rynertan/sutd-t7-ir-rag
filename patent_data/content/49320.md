# Digital frequency synthesizer.

## Abstract
A digital frequency synthesizer for synthesizing a selected frequency or a library of preselected frequencies in which a selected phase increment is fed at a clock rate to an adder and accumulating register in mutual cooperation as a digital integrator, the resultant period overflow of the register corresponding to the selected frequency of interest. An improvement is provided for reducing discrete spectral spurs in the spectral output of the synthesizer by means of preselectively randomly jittering the input to, or output of, the register, whereby the average periodicity of the register overflow for a selected frequency is not affected.
