# MEDIA AND METHOD FOR PRINTING

## Abstract
Media and method for printing which is so constructed that on one main surface of a heat conductive layer of electric insulating property are successively laminated a first conductive layer, a resistive layer, and a second conductive layer, media for printing having an ink layer laminated on the other main surface of the heat conductive layer is superposed at the ink layer side on an object to be printed, and an elec trode is brought into press contact with the surface of the second conductive layer, so that electric signals are applied between the electrode and the first conductive layer, thereby enabling the printing of images corresponding to the electric signals.
