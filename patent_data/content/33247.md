# Electrolytic apparatus for reclaiming dissolved metal from liquid.

## Abstract
An apparatus is disclosed for reclaiming dissolved metal from a liquid, in which a pail or similar container 10 is pro vided with at least one pair of nested, concentric cylindrical metal cathodes 16,34 with an anode rod 40 located concen tric with the central cathode 34 and a plurality of anode rods 38 located in the annulus between the cathodes 16,34 . Liquid containing metal to be reclaimed is introduced by grav ity feed at a location 20 near the bottom of the container 10 so that when a voltage is applied between the cathodes 16, 34 and anodes 38, 40 , the dissolved metal plates out on the cathodes 16, 34 and essentially metal free liquid may be drawn off at a location 22 near the upper portion of the container.
