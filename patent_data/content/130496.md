# Magnetic field sensing device.

## Abstract
A magnetic field sensing device employs a magnetoresis tive element which exhibits a negative Δρ effect Δρ ρ ρ when a magnetic field is applied to it to magnetise it to satura tion at room temperature. The electrical resistivity ρ of the element in a direction perpendicular to the direction of current through the element is greater than the electrical resistivity ρ of the element in a direction parallel to the direction of the elec trical current through the element. The magnetoresistive ele ment is formed from a ferromagnetic material containing at least one of Ni Fe and Co together with Ir in an amount suffi cient to cause the element to exhibit negative anisotropic mag netoresistance at room temperature.
