## Description

The ceramic materials of this invention are obtained by firing a mixture of a polycarbosilane and iron octoate to an elevated temperature in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum.

Preferred sintering aids include substances or compounds of such elements as B, Al, Fe, W, Mg, Ti and others. The halogen and organic substituted compounds are preferred as sintering aids. Yajima et al., J. Mat. Sci., 13, 2569 1978 andHasegawa et al., J. Mat. Sci., 18, 3633 1983 also discuss polycarbosilanes which are useful as preceramic polymers for preparing silicon carbide ceramics. What is newly discovered is that iron octoate, when added to polycarbosilanes prior to firing at elevated temperatures, allows for the formation of ceramic materials with a significant increase in ceramic yield relative to ceramic materials fired under the same conditions without the additive. This invention relates to a method of preparing a ceramic material with increased ceramic yield, said method comprising heating a modified polycarbosilane in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum to a temperature of at least 7500C until said modified polycarbosilane is converted to a ceramic material with increased ceramic yield relative to a nonmodified polycarbosilane heated under the same conditions, wherein said modified polycarbosilane is prepared by mixing the non modified polycarbosilane with an effective, ceramic yield increasing, amount of iron octoate. Ceramic yield, as employed in this present invention disclosure, is the percentage yield of the ceramic product upon firing a modified or non modified polycarbosilane to an elevated temperature under an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum until the modified or non modified polycarbosilane is converted to a ceramic material. The ceramic yield is calculated by dividing the weight of the ceramic product obtained by the initial weight of the modified or non modified polycarbosilane and then multiplying the result by 100. A correction for the amount of iron octoate added is not made. The process of this invention is carried out by first mixing a polycarbosilane with an effective amount of iron octoate and then firing the resulting mixture to an elevated temperature under an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum until the resulting mixture is converted to a ceramic material. By iron octoate , we mean both iron II octoate and iron III octoate. Iron III octoate orFe OOC CH2 6CH3 3 is preferred. As one skilled in the art would realize, not all combinations of polycarbosilane, the iron octoate compounds, and pyrolysis conditions will lead to ceramic materials with increased ceramic yield. Routine experimentation may be required in some cases to determine if an increase in ceramic yield is actually realized. Cases where such an increase in ceramic yield is not realized are not considered to be within the scope of this invention. The method of mixing the polycarbosilane and the iron octoate is not critical. It is preferred that the polycarbosilane and the iron octoate be well mixed to help insure that the ceramic yield does not vary significantly throughout the ceramic material or article. Using an organic solvent such as toluene for the mixing medium helps to insure that the two components are well mixed. Other mixing techniques may be used. The polycarbosilane is mixed with an effective amount of iron octoate. By an effective amount of the iron octoate, we mean that amount which results in an increased ceramic yield in the resulting ceramic material. Generally, the iron octoate is added at such a level so as to obtain a mixture containing the polycarbosilane and 0.1 to 2.0 weight percent of the iron. Iron octoate may be added at higher levels although no added benefits may result. It is preferred that the iron octoate be present at a level equivalent to about 0.5 to 1.5 weight percent of elemental iron The increase in ceramic yield of the ceramic material prepared by the method of this invention is determined by comparison with the ceramic yield of a ceramic material obtained by firing the same polycarbosilane, without the added iron octoate, under the same experimental conditions. The mixture of polycarbosilane and an effective amount of a iron octoate is fired to an elevated temperature of at least 7500C under an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum until the mixture is converted to a ceramic material. Although not wishing to be held to such a theory, the inventor believes that the iron octoate additives of this invention interact with the polycarbosilane during the early stages of the pyrolysis step. The interaction may be in the form of crosslinking or the promotion of crosslinking of potentially volatile species from the polycarbosilane. By keeping potentially volatile material in the system more carbon, nitrogen, and silicon are available for conversion to ceramic in the latter stages of the pyrolysis step. It is expected that iron octoate will be reduced to iron metal during the pyrolysis. The polycarbosilanes suitable for use in this present invention contain Si and C as the main skeleton elements in the form of QSiCH2 units. The polycarbosilanes useful in this invention may also contain oxygen as a skeleton element in addition to Si and C as the main skeleton elements. Oxygen may be introduced during preparation or handling or may be incorporated into the polycarbosilane by design. It is preferred that the amount of oxygen present is less than about 10 weight percent, more preferably less than about 5 weight percent, and most preferably less than 1 weight percent. Other elements may also be present as main skeleton elements in addition to Si, C, and 0. However, these other elements should be present at less than about 1 weight percent and preferably only be present at trace levels i.e. less than 0.1 weight percent .Suitable polycarbosilanes may be prepared by methods well known in the art.For example, suitable polycarbosilanes may be prepared from monosilanes by pyrolysis at 400 to 12000C as described byVerbeck et al. in German OLS 2,236,078.7. Suitable polycarbosilanes may also be prepared from polysilanes by heating and polycondensing the polysilanes at 300 to 20000C under an inert atmosphere or vacuum as described by Yajima et al. in U. S. Patents 4,052,430 and 4,100,233. Other suitable polycarbosilanes may be prepared by heating a mixture of polysilanes with about 0.01 to 15 weight percent of a phenylborosilane under an inert atmosphere as described inYajima et al. in U. S. Patents 4,220,600 and 4,283,376.Suitable polycarbosilanes may also be prepared by the method of Iwai et al. U. S. Patent 4,377,677 wherein an improved procedure for preparing polycarbosilanes from polysilanes is disclosed. The branched polycarbosilanes of Schilling U. S.Patent 4,414,403 are also suitable for use in this present invention. Other polycarbosilanes capable of being converted to ceramic material by pyrolysis at elevated temperatures under an inert atmosphere or vacuum are also useful in the present invention. Preferred polycarbosilanes for the practice of this invention are prepared from the thermal polycondensation of polysilanes as described in U. S. Patents 4,052,430 and 4,100,233. More preferred polycarbosilanes are prepared by thermally decomposing and polycondensing a polysilane or polysilanes by heating said polysilane or polysilanes at a temperature of 300 20000C in an inert gas, hydrogen, or vacuum wherein said polysilane or polysilanes are selected from the group consisting of cyclic polysilanes of the general formula R1R2 Si n and linear polysilanes of the general formulaEMI7.1 where n is greater than or equal to 4 where m is greater than or equal to 2 and where RÚ, Rê, R , and R4 are independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, alkyl groups containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, phenyl, Si R5 3 groups where R5 is a alkyl group containing 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and halogen atoms. Examples of R1 , R2, R3, and R4 as alkyl groups and R5 include methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl groups.Examples of RÚ, Rê, R , and R4 as halogens include chlorine and bromine with chlorine being preferred. The most preferred polycarbosilanes are prepared by the thermal decomposition and polycondensation of dodecamethylcyclohexasilane or polydimethylsilane. The actual method of preparing the polycarbosilanes for use in the invention is not critical. The polycarbosilanes should contain Si, C, and optionally, 0 as the main skeleton elements and should be capable of being converted to silicon carbide containing ceramics upon pyrolysis to elevated temperatures in an inert atmosphere or vacuum.Preferably, the polycarbosilanes used in the practice of this invention have a softening point of about 50 to 3000C and most preferably in the range of 70 to 2000 C. After the polycarbosilane and the iron octoate are mixed, the mixture is fired to an elevated temperature of at least 7500C until the mixture is converted to a ceramic material. It is generally preferred that the polycarbosilane and iron octoate mixture be vacuum stripped prior to pyrolysis. If the polycarbosilane and irob octoate mixture is of sufficient viscosity or if it possesses a sufficiently low melt temperature, it can be shaped first and then pyrolyzed to give a silicon carbide containing shaped article such as a fiber. The polycarbosilane and iron octoate mixture can be filled with ceramic type fillers if desired and then fired to at least 7500C to obtain silicon carbide ceramic materials or silicon carbide ceramic articles. The polycarbosilane and iron octoate mixtures of this invention can be used in both the filled and unfilled state, depending on the application. Thus, it is contemplated within the scope of this invention to coat substrates with filled and unfilled mixtures and heat the substrates to produce ceramic coated articles. Fillers and adjuvants can be milled on 3 roll mills by simply mixing the polycarbosilane and iron octoate of this invention with the fillers and making several passes on the mill. In the alternative, the polycarbosilane and iron octoate can be placed in solvents and the fillers and adjuvants can be added thereto and, after mixing, the solvent can be removed to give the filled mixture. The coating can be carried out by conventional means. The means used depends on the mixture and substrates used and the application one has in mind. Thus, these materials can be brushed, rolled, dipped or sprayed. In the filled state, it is sometimes necessary to trowel the mixture onto the substrate. The polycarbosilane and iron octoate mixtures of this invention may also be used as an infiltrant with ceramic materials or as a matrix material for composites. Other uses will be apparent to those skilled in the art from a consideration of this specification. So that those skilled in the art can better appreciate and understand the invention, the following examples are given. A solution method for mixing the polycarbosilane and iron octoate additive was employed. The desired amount of the iron octoate additive was dissolved in dry toluene.The polycarbosilane was added to the toluene solution to give a 35 weight percent solution. The resulting solution was placed in a glass jar, purged with argon, and then sealed.The solution was then agitated for 4 hours on a wheel mixer.Solvent was removed from the modified polycarbosilane by vacuum stripping for four hours at 250C and 3mm Hg and for one hour at 500C and 2mm Hg. All mixed samples were stored under argon in a dry box until used. Samples were fired in an Astro Industries Furnace water cooled, graphite heated, model 1000.3060 FP 12 under a helium atmosphere or in a Lindberg furnace Heavy Duty SBType 54877A under argon. In the examples, control samples were subjected to the same treatment i.e., the solution mixing method as the iron containing polycarbosilane except that the control samples did not contain iron additive. The ceramic yield of control samples that were subjected to the mixing procedure and control samples that were not subjected to the mixing procedure were essentially identical when fired to elevated temperatures under the same pyrolysis conditions. The polycarbosilane employed in the example was obtained from Nippon Carbon Co., Ltd., 2 6 1, Hachi Chobari,Chuo Ku, Tokyo 104, Japan and is thought to be prepared by the method described in U.S. Patents 4,052,430 and 4,100,233.The polycarbosilane was yellow in appearance and was soluble in toluene, xylene, n hexane, n heptane, and tetrahydrofuran and was insoluble in methanol and water. IR analysis KBr plates with film of polycarbosilane cast from toluene solution indicated absorptions at 740 and 830 cm 1 SiCH3 , 1020 and 1355 cmÚ SiCH2Si , 2095 cm 1 SiH , 1255, 1400, 2900, and 2960 cm 1 CH32 . Molecular weight distribution was determined by gel permeation chromatography using a four weight percent of the polycarbosilane in a toluene solution with a toluene elutant at a flow rate of 1.5 ml minute and a differential refratometer detector. Molecular weight measurements were relative to a polysiloxane standard. The polycarbosilane had a number average molecular weight of 1166 g mole and a weight average molecular weight of 2260 g mole.The molecular weight polydispersity was 1.94. The polycarbosilane had a penetration temperature of 172 C as determined on a DuPont Instruments Thermoanalyzer Model 1090 equipped with a Model 1091 DuPont Disk Memory and a DuPont Model 943Thermomechanical Analyzer. The penetration temperature is related to the softening point.Example 1 A mixture of the powdered polycarbosilane 19.8 g described above and iron III octoate 3.33 g of a mineral spirits solution containing 6 weight percent iron was prepared using the solution mixing method described above.The amount of iron III octoate employed was such that the final polycarbosilane iron III octoate mixture contained 1 weight percent iron. Samples of both a control polycarbosilane without added iron III octoate and the polycarbosilane iron III octoate mixture were fired to various elevated temperatures under a helium atmosphere in the Astro furnace. The results are presented in Table I. All ceramic yield data for the iron III octoate containing polycarbosilane samples are the average of two runs.Example 2 This example is for comparative purposes only. A mixture of 12.3 g polycarbosilane as described above and a degassed solution of 0.36 g FeC13 in 125 ml of tbluene was prepared under an agron atmosphere. After filtering the solution, the toluene was removed. The polycarbosilane FeCl3 mixture contained about 1 weight percent iron. Both a control sample containing only the polycarbosilane and the polycarbosilane FeCl3 mixture sample were fired to 12000C at a rate of 50C min under argon in the Lindberg furnace. The ceramic yields of the control and the polycarbosilane FeCl3 mixture were 61.5 weight percent and 55.2 weight percent, respectively. This represents a decrease of 10.2 percent in the ceramic yield of the FeCl3 containing polycarbosilane relative to the control. 12TABLE IADDITIVE TOTAL FIRING TIME AT FINAL CERAMIC IMPROVEMENT TIME Hrs FINAL TEMP TEMP C YIELD IN CERAMIC YIELD Hrs Wt.
