# Testing operability of a controlled rectifier device.

## Abstract
The state of operability of a semiconductor device 1 , e.g. a TRIAC, is tested by introducing narrow switching pulses into its normal control signal 7, 8 and sensing the resulant momentary change of state. Sensing is by means of a light emitting diode 13, 16 connected in parallel with the device 1 so that when sufficient voltage appears across the device terminals, as in the non conducting state, the diode 13, 16 will be illuminated. The L.E.D. output is received by a photo responsive device 20, 19 and corresponding signals 21 supplied to means for correlating these with the original introduced test pulses. Lack of correspondence between these indicates that the semiconductor 1 is inoperable.
