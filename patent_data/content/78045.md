# Synchronizing signal generating circuit for solid state colour video camera.

## Abstract
A synchronizing signal generating circuit generating a horizontal synchronizing signal applied to a solid state color video camera comprises an oscillator 1 1b generating an oscillation output signal having a frequency which is n n an integer times as high as the horizontal frequency, a frequency divider 12 dividing the frequency of the oscilla tion output signal from the oscillator to generate a pulse signal having a recurrence frequency equal to the horizontal frequency, and another oscillator 15 generating, in re sponse to the application of the pulse signal to its control terminal, a horizontal clock pulse signal whose oscillation phase is controlled to be maintained at the same fixed phase in each horizontal period.
