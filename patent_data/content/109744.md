# UV curable composition and coatings.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a UV curable coating composition and method of preparing it, a method of coating a conductor with it, and the resulting coated conductor. The composition comprises about 20 to about 40 by weight of an acrylated epoxy which is the reaction product of an epoxy resin and an acrylate adduct. The acrylate adduct is the reaction product of an acrylate which may be either 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate, 2 hydroxypropyl acrylate, 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate or mixture thereof, and either an anhydride or a diisocyanate. The anhydride may be phthalic anhydride, maleic anhydride, trimellitic anhydride, or mixture thereof. The diisocyanate can be toluene diisocyanate, 4,4 diisocyanato diphenyl methane, or mixtures thereof. The composition also includes about 4 to about 15 by weight of an acrylated blocked isocyanate which is the reaction product of caprolactam and an acrylated isocyanate. The acrylated isocyanate is the reaction product of an acrylate which can be 2 hydroxyethyl acrylate, 2 hydroxypropyl acrylate, 2 hydroxyethyl methac rylate, or mixtures thereof, with an isocyanate which can be toluene diisocyanate, 4,4 diisocyanato diphenyl methane, or mixtures thereof. The composition also includes about 45 to about 65 by weight of a mono acrylate of which at least 60 by weight is phenoxyethyl acrylate, about 5 to about 20 by weight of a polyacrylate of which at least about 50 is triethylene glycol diacrylate, about 2 to about 5 of a photoinitiator, and about 0.05 to about 0.3 by weight of an inhibitor.
