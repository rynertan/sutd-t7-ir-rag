# Process for preparing 1,2 dihydro 6 methyl 2 oxo 5 pyridinyl nicotinonitriles.

## Abstract
A process for preparing cardiotonically active 1,2 di hydro 6 methyl 2 oxo pyridinyl nicotinonitriles which comprises reacting a pyridinylmethyl methyl ketone with ethoxymethylenemalononitrille, where pyridinyl is 4 or 3 pyridinyl or 4 or 3 pyridinyl having one or two lower alkyl substituents.
