# Proximity adjustment means.

## Abstract
A means for adjusting an electrical value within inac cessible electrical circuitry is disclosed including a proxim ity stimulus means 11 acting upon and within the vicinity of a proximity stimulus response means 3 to produce a response which is converted into an electrical signal by a transducing means 5 . The number of electrical signals produced are accumulated and placed into the appropriate electronic form to adjust the electrical value. The magnitude of the adjustable electrical value and its adjustment may be monitored on an optional monitoring means 7 .
