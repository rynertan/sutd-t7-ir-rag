# Process for making a casting solution and membranes prepared from that casting solution.

## Abstract
A casting solution of polyaramide in N,N dimethylacetamide containing about 10 to 60 by wt. MgClâ‚‚, based on polyaramide, and a process for making such casting solution, are provided. An asymmetric permselective membrane and process for making such membrane from the casting solution are also provided. Such membrane has excellent performance characteristics in a reverse osmosis process for purifying salt water.
