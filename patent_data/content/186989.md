## Description
5 2 CHLORO 4 TRIFLUOROMETHYLPHENOXY 2 NITRO E SUBSTITUTEDACETOPHENONE, OXIME DERIVATIVE THEREOF, PROCESS FOR PREPARINGTHEREOF, HERBItIDAL COMPOSTTION,AND METHOD FOR THE DESTRUCTIONOF UNDESIRABLE WEEDS This invention relates to a novel compound which exhibits a high herbicidal activity with high selec tivity, a novel process for the preparation thereof, a novel herbicidal composition comprising as an active ingredient the novel compound which is useful as an effective herbicide for various crops and a method for the destruction of undesirable weeds using the novel compound.More particularly, the present invention is concerned with a 5 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethyl phenoxy 2 nitro a substituted acetophenone compound and an oxime derivative thereof, a process for the preparation of such compounds, a herbicidal composi tion comprising such compounds and a method for the destruction of undesirable weeds using the compound. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART To now, a herbicide comprising as an active ingredient an alkyl 2 nitro 5 2 chloro 4 trifluoro methylphenoxy phenyl ketone compound or an oxime derivative thereof is well known as the generally called diphenyl ether type herbicide see, for example, U.S. Patents No. 4,344,789 and No. 4,401,602 . Also, is well known, as another class of the diphenyl ether type herbicide, a herbicide com prising as an active ingredient an oxime derivative of 2 nitro 5 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethylphenoxy phenyl acetonitrile see, U.S. Patent No. 4,490,167 . However, with respect to all of the known diphenyl ether herbicides, there is a dilemma, that is, when they are good in herbicidal activity, they are poor in selectivity, and when they are good in selectivity, they are poor in herbicidal activity.Hence, any of them is not suitable for efficient and prompt control of only undesirable species of weeds. The ideal herbicide should be one which further satisfies the following conditions in addition to the above stated excellent herbicidal activity and high selectivity. The toxicity of the herbicide to warmblooded animals must be low. The herbicide is effective even if it is applied any time through the whole period of growth of crop plants. Moreover, after usage, the herbicide decomposes as promptly as possible so that it does not contaminate the soil.However, such an ideal diphenyl ether herbicide which satisfies the above conditions is not yet known.OBJECT OF THE INVENTION Under the above stated current situation, the inventors have made intensive studies to develop a novel diphenyl ether herbicide which is free from the drawbacks inevitably accompanying the conventional diphenyl ether herbicides, which has selective and high herbicidal activity that means complete safety to crop plants and prompt elimination of any unnecessary weeds present therewith, which can be used continuously through the whole period of growth of crop plants.As a result, it has been found that a novel 5 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethylphenoxy 2 nitro a substituted acetophenone compound and oxime derivatives thereof satisfy the above mentioned requirements for an improved herbicide, and that the compounds, even at a low dosage, are very effective for a wide spectrum of broad leaved and Gramineae family crop plants, such as soybean, peanut, corn, wheat and rice plants. Based on this novel finding, the present invention has been completed. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel 5 2 chloro 4 trifluoromethylphenoxy 2 nitro a substituted acetophenone compound and an oxime derivative thereof having a high selectivity as well as a high herbicidal activity. It is another object of the present invention to provide a process for the preparation of the above mentioned compounds having a highly selective herbicidal activity. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a novel herbicidal composition containing the above mentioned compounds. It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a method for the destruction of undesirable weeds using the novel compound of the described above. It is still a further object of the present invention to provide novel intermediate compounds which are useful for the preparation of the abovementioned compounds. The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description and appended claims.DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In one aspect of this invention, there is provided a compound represented by the formulaEMI4.1 whereinR1 represents a methyl group orEMI5.1 in which A represents an oxygen atom or a sulfur. atom, R3 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, and R4 represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkenyl group having 3 to 6 carbon atoms, an alkynyl group having 3 to 6 carbon atoms, or an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and substituted with a halogen atom, an alkoxy group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms or a carboalkoxy group having 2 to 4 carbon atoms andY represents an oxygen atom or N O R2 in which R2 represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms orEMI5.2 in whichR5 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, andR6 represents BR7 orEMI5.3 in whichB represents an oxygen atom or a sulfur atom,R7 represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, an alkenyl group having 3 to 6 carbon atoms, an alkynyl group having 3 to 6 carbon atoms, a substituted or unsubstituted phenyl group, an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms and substituted with a halogen atom or an alkoxy group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal in proportion corresponding to mono valency of the alkaline earth metal, an ammonium group, an ammonium group substituted with an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, orEMI6.1 in which R10 represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, and R11 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, andR8 and R9 are identical or different and each independently represent a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, an alkynyl group having 3 to 6 carbon atoms, or an alkoxy group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms. The characteristic feature of the compounds of the present invention resides in that they have, in their respective molecular structures, an substi tuted acetophenone or an oxime derivative thereof, as opposed to the conventional similar compounds which have, in their respective molecular structures, an aunsubstituted alkyl phenyl ketone such as acetophenone or propiophenone, an oxime derivative thereof, or an oxime derivative of phenylacetonitrile. It is surprising that the introduction of a substituent to the a position of the acetophenone moiety enables the compounds of the present invention to provide a preemergence or postemergence herbicide which is very effective for control of undesirable weeds at a lower dosage and has a high selectivity as well as a high activity, as compared with the conventional compounds having similar structures.

the present invention.Preparation Example 1 wettable powder 25 Parts by weight of the compound of the present invention, 5 parts by weight of Sorpol 5039 trade name of a product of Toho Chemical Industry Company,Japan and 70 parts by weight of talc are thoroughly pulverized and mixed to obtain wettable powder.Preparation Example 2 emulsifiable concentrate 5 Parts by weight of the compound of the present invention, 10 parts by weight of Sorpol 3005 X a product of Toho Chemical Industry Company, Japan , 45 parts by weight of n butanol and 40 parts by weight of xylene are thoroughly mixed to obtain emulsifiable concentrate.Preparation Example 3 granule 1 Part by weight of the compound of the present invention, 45 parts by weight of bentonite, 44 parts by weight of clay, 5 parts by weight of sodium lignosulfonate and 5 parts by weight of sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate are thoroughly pulverized and mixed.To the mixture is added water, and the resultant is thoroughly kneaded. The kneaded mixture is then subjected to granulation, followed by drying, thereby to obtain granule.Preparation Example 4 dust 1 Part by weight of the compound of the present invention and 99 parts by weight of clay are thoroughly pulverized and mixed to obtain dust.Application Example 1 Pots each having a surface area of 1 2500 a were packed with upland soil in a greenhouse. In each pot were planted seeds of soybean, Indian corn, crabgrass, velvetleaf, lambsquarter and smartweed. The preemergence application was effected, by applying a composition in a dosage of 25 a.i. g lOa, 24 hours after the planting of the seeds. On the other hand, the postemergence application was effected by applying a composition in a dosage of 10 a.i. g 10a, when the soybean, the Indian corn and the weeds grew up to respectively 2 to 3 leaf stage, 3 to 4 leaf stage and 2 to 2.5 leaf stage. The herbicidal com position of the present invention was applied as follows. Using the compounds listed in Table 3, emulsifiable concentrates were prepared according to the method described in Preparation Example 2. Each of the thus prepared concentrates was diluted with 10 liters of water per each are of the upland soil, and then applied by means of a glass sprayer. 14 Days after the application, the degree of the herbicidal effect on weeds was observed. 30 Days after the application, the degree of the phytotoxicity to crop plants was observed. The results obtained are shown in Table 3. The values indicated in Table 3 are based on the following criterion. 5 Perfect inhibition 4 80 inhibition 3 60 inhibition 2 40 inhibition 1 20 inhibition 0 No effect Table 3 EMI76.1 SEP Herbicidal

In the soil of each section were sown seeds of soybean and Indian corn for crop plants and seeds of crabgrass, lambsquarter, smartweed, velvetleaf, hemp sesbania, morningglory, jimsonweed, teaweed and cocklebur for weeds, respectively, and allowed to grow. The postemergence application was effected to the stalks and leaves when the soybean, the Indian corn and the weeds grew up to respectively 2 go 3 leaf stage, 3 to 4 leaf stage and 3 to 5 leaf stage. The herbicidal composition of the present invention was applied as follows.Using the compounds listed in Table 4, emulsifiable concentrates were prepared according to the method described inPreparation Example 2. Each of the thus prepared concentrates was diluted with 10 liters of water per each are of the upland soil, and then applied by means of a sprayer. 14 Days after the application, the degree of the herbicidal effect on the weeds was observed. 30 Days after the application, the degree of the phytotoxicity to the crop plants was observed.The results obtained are shown in Table 4.

Seeds of barnyardgrass and monochria, seeds of broad leaved annual weeds, toothcup and false pimpernel, and seeds of perennial weeds, Hotarui Scirpus juncoides , were mixed with dry paddy field soil and incorporated into the surface soil. Further, as the perennial weeds, tubers of arrowhead and flat sedge were transplanted. Rice seedlings of 3 leaf stage were transplanted at a depth of 2 to 3 cm from the surface soil. Using the compounds listed in Table 5, emulsifiable concentrates were prepared according to the method described in Preparation Example 2. Each of the thus prepared concentrates was diluted with water and dropwise applied by means of a pipette when the barnyardgrass grew up to 0.5 to 1 leaf stage. 21 Days after the application, phytotoxicity to rice plants and herbicidal effects on weeds were observed.
