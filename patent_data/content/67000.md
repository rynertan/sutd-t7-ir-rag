## Description
DESCRIPTION PRODUCTION OF A NITROGEN CONTAINING POLYSACCHARIDE HAVING ANTI TUMOUR ACTIVITY The present invention concerns a process for producing a nitrogen containing polysaccharide having an anti tumour activity by culturing mycelia of CordscePs ophioqlossoides Fr. belonging to Ascomycetes. In recent years, various methods for producing polysaccharides or protein containing polysaccharides having anti tumour activity by culturing a Basidiomycetes fungus have been reported. Some methods have been practised industrially, for instance United States PatentNo. 4,051,314 Ohtsuka et al . The present inventors, while researching into the anti tumour activity shown by the polysaccharides produced by microbes, have found that a nitrogen containing polysaccharide having a high anti tumour activity is produced by culturing mycelia of Cordsceps ophioqlossoides Fr. By the way, a fruit body per se of Cordyceps ophioqlossoides Fr. has been customarily used as a roborantia, so called vegetative wasp , belonging to Ascomycetes. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for producing a nitrogen containing polysaccharide characterized by culturing mycelia of a strain of Cordyceps ophioglossoides Fr. in a liquid medium and obtaining the said polysaccharide thus produced. Preferably, a strain of Cordyceps ophioglossoidesFr. is cultured by agar plate culture to form mycelia of said fungus, the thus obtained mycelia are successively cultured in a liquid medium to produce the said polysaccharide therein, and the said polysaccharide thus produced is separated from the liquid medium. Growth of the mycelia in a liquid medium is preferably achieved by culture in a stationary state for 3 to 5 days at a temperature of 25 to 270C and then in a shaking state or under aeration agitation for 4 to 6 days at a temperature of 25 to 270C. In the description which follows, reference will be made to the accompanying drawing which is an infrared absorption spectrum of the nitrogen containing polysaccharide obtained by the process according to the present invention. The strain of CordscePs ophioqlossoides Fr.utilized in the present invention is one which produces the desired nitrogen containing polysaccharide. Cordvceps ophioqlossoides Fr. is a known species of fungus belonging to genus Cordsceps of family Hypocreales of the classAscomycetes. It is parasitic to Elaphomyces varieqatus Vittad. and E prannulatus Nees, etc in soil. It assumes a similar shape to C capitata, however, the head is elliptic to club like dark green and later black in colour, and the size is 6 15 x 4 9mm. The flesh is yellowish white in colour. The stem is 4 9 x 0.1 0.3 mm and cylindrical.The base of the stem splitts into roots connected to the host body. The perithecium is 0.6 0.7 x 0.3 0.4 mm. The ascospore splits further into finer and rectangular arthroconidia. A preferred strain has been deposied under deposit number lFO 8992 at the Institute of Fermentation, Osaka, Japan, which is one of the culture collections recognised for the purposes of the EPC, and under deposit number FERM BP 128 at the Fermentation Research Institute, Agency of IndustrialScience and Technology, Japanese Government, which is anInternational Depositary Authority under the Budapest Treaty. In a preferred embodiment of the process of the present invention, Cordsceps ohioqIossoidets Fr lFO 8992 FERM BP 128 is at first cultured in an agar plate culture used for culturing a mold fungus or yeast, for instance that prepared by admixing 0.1 to 0.3 by weight of yeast extract with a potato dextrose agar medium and adjusting the pH to 4 to 7 usually at 20 to 300C, preferably 25 to 270C for 10 to 14 days to obtain the proliferated mycelia. Then, the thus obtained white to pale brown mycelia are preferably cultured in a liquid medium as a seed culture generally for 3 to 6 days in a stationary state at the early stage and for 4 to 6 days in a shaking state or under aeration agitation.The reason why the culture is preferably carried out in this mode is that where the culture is directly carried out in a shaking state or under aeration agitation, although the proliferation of the mycelium is vigorous, the production of the nitrogen containing polysaccharide is reduced. The temperature of the liquid culture is 20 to 300C, preferably 25 to 270C throughout the two stages. The medium used in the liquid culture may be any one of the known media used generally for culturing microorganisms, for instance a medium containing glucose as the carbon source to which pepton and yeast extract have been added. In addition, inorganic salts, vitamins or a milk component may be added to the media. The pH of the initial culture medium is suitably 4 to 7. A liquid medium showing a pH of 5.5 before sterilization is particularly preferable for use. Furthermore, although the culture of the abovementioned Ascomycetes fungus in a liquid medium can be carried out generation after generation, the productivity of the nitrogen containing polysaccharide by the fungus is reduced with increase in the number of successive cultivations.Accordingly, successive cultivation in liquid culture medium should preferably be limited within only 3 to 5 times.However, from the viewpoint of the productivity of the nitrogen containing polysaccharide, it is more profitable to utilise a seed culture grown on by stationary culture on an agar plate every time than successively cultivating the liquid culture. However, accompanying the enlargement of the scale of cultivation, for instance, a liquid culture of more than 10 litres is carried out. It is operationally difficult to use such mycelia obtained by agar plate culture as the seed culture. Accordingly, the product of the above mentioned liquid culture in a stationary state may be used as the seed culture. The mycelia cultured in a liquid medium as mentioned above according to the process of the present invention produce a highly viscous substance and excrete it into the culture medium with the result of making the cultured material highly viscous. In order to recover the nitrogen containing polysaccharide having an anti tumour activity from the highly viscous cultured material, a method of extraction is required. However, since direct extraction from the highly viscous cultured material is not effective, it is preferable to carry out the extraction as follows First, the cultured material is diluted with 2 to 3 times its weight of distilled water. After heating the diluted material at 80 to 900C for 30 min, the material is stirred well in a mixer.The thus treated mixture is subjected to centrifugal separation or filtration to obtain an aqueous liquid material from which the nitrogen containing polysaccharide is collected. The solid residue of centrifugal separation or filtration is mixed with 2 to 3 times its weight of distilled water and the aqueous mixture is subjected to a crusher, for instance Waring blender to crush the mycelia. After subjecting the aqueous mixture containing the crushed mycelia to centrifugal separation, it is possible to obtain an additional amount of the nitrogen containing polysaccharide from the thus separated filtrate. Since the thus obtained aqueous liquid material and filtrate contain various impurities such as free protein, free nucleic acid and reducing sugars, the aqueous liquid and the filtrate are preferably treated with activated carbon or a weakly basic ion exchanging resin or by chromatography to remove the impurities. By such a treatment, decolorization of the aqueous liquid and the filtrate is effected. In addition, other means of purification of the thus obtained aqueous liquid material and filtrate such as salting out with ammonium sulfate, precipitation with a lower alcohol or acetone, molecular sieving and ultrafiltration may be used additionally either singly or in combination as well as theSevag method which is used for extracting polysaccharide from cultured materials and the method using enzymes. After carrying out dialysis of the thus purified aqueous liquid material and filtrate both containing the nitrogen containing polysaccharide obtained from the cultured material of Cordyceps ophioalossoides Fr. against distilled water and concentrating the dialyzate if necessary, the dialyzate or its concentrate is freeze dried as the nitrogen containing polysaccharide of the present invention hereinafter referred to as the present substance . The steps of purification and those thereafter of the aqueous liquid material and the filtrate may be respectively carried out on the aqueous liquid material and the filtrate as mentioned above. However, these steps may be preferably carried out on a mixture of the aqueous liquid material and the filtrate. Further, the aqueous mixture containing crushed mycelia may be directly mixed with the aqueous liquid material, without subjecting the aqueous mixture to centrifugal separation, and then the thus obtained mixture may be subjected to the steps of purification and those thereafter. The thus obtained present substance has the following physical properties Appearance White powdery substance, carbonized with decomposition by heating without showing a clear melting point. Infrared The result of determination using a KBr absorption tablet is shown in the accompanying spectrum drawing. Solubility Soluble in water and dimethylsulfoxide but insoluble in organic solvents in general. In addition, an aqueous solution of the present substance does not permeate a semipermeable membrane, the pH of an aqueous 2 to 10 by weight solution of the present substance is 6.2 to 6.4 and no recognisable ultraviolet absorption is obtainable from an aqueous 0.1 by weight solution of the present substance. Colour reaction Positive Molish, anthrone and ninhydrin reactions, and negative Elson Morgan, Bachart and iodo starch reactions. In addition, glucose and a small amount of mannose and galactose were detected by gas chromatography in the product obtained by hydrolyzing the present substance with 2 to 4 N sulfuric acid followed by neutralization and trimethylsilylization. Further, in the product obtained by hydrolyzing the present substance with 4N hydrochloric acid for 14 hours, galactosamine and a small amount of glucosamine were detected by an amino acid autoanalyser. It has been confirmed that the present substance consists of the respective polymers of neutral sugars and amino sugars and proteins, as a result of analysis of a supernatant liquid obtained by subjecting to centrifugal separation the well solubilized present substance dispersed in water at a concentration of 1 mg ml by treatment such as supersonic irradiation. Although the contents of these components depend on the condition of cultivation of the fungus and the conditions of extraction of the cultured material, generally they are as follows Neutral sugars 40 to 50 by weight as total hexose by the phenol sulfuric acid method. Amino sugars 15 to 25 by weight as hexosamine by the indole hydrochloric acid method. Protein 5 to 15 by weight as protein by the Lowery Folin method. Considering of the foregoing characteristics, the present substance obtained according to this invention is believed to be a new nitrogen containing polysaccharide. Pharmacological properties of the present substance will be explained as follows 1 Acute mammalian toxicity As test animals, ICR JCL mice 4 to 5 weeks old and with a body weight of 20 to 25 g, and Wistar rats 4 to 5 weeks old and with a body weight of 110 to 150 g were used.The present substance was orally or intraperitoneally administered to each animal of groups each consisting of 25 animals at various dose rates. The symptoms, change of body weight and mortality of the animals were observed for a week. Then, all animals were sacrificed and autopsied.

The number of animals in eachSarcoma 180 tumour test group was 10 and for each Ehrlich s tumour group was 11. a Anti tumour activity aqainst Sarcoma 180 tumour At the right lower side of each mouse of the test group and the control group, 0.1 ml of aqueous physiological saline solution containing about 4 x 106 cell of Sarcoma 180 tumour ascitic type successively cultured intraperitoneally in a mouse of the same strain as in the test group and after one week of inoculation was subcutaneously injected, and 24 hours after transplantation, 0.25 ml of aqueous physiological saline solution containing 5 mg of the present substance per ml of the solution and having been sterilized for 15 min at 120 0C was intraperitoneally administered to each mouse of the test group. The same administration was repeated once a day for 10 days running. 0.25 ml of physiological saline solution was administered in,the same manner as for the test group to each mouse of the control group. All mice were sacrificed after 35 days of transplantation to extirpate the solid Sarcoma 180 tumour, which was weighed. The anti tumour activity of the present substance against Sarcoma 180 tumour is evaluated by the rate of inhibition on the proliferation of the inoculated tumour cells according to the following formula C T Rate of inhibition s Ts x 100 C S wherein Cs is the average weight of the tumour in the control group and T5 is the average weight of the tumour in the test group. As a result of the above mentioned test, the present substance showed a rate of inhibition of as high as 83.5 . and no tumour could be found in five out of the total of 10 animals of the test group. b Anti tumour activity against Ehrlich s ascites tumour 1 x 106 Cells of Ehrlich s ascites tumour were transplanted into each mouse in 4 groups. 24 Hours after transplantation, the present substance was intraperitoneally administered as a solution in aqueous physiological saline solution at the respective daily dose rates of 25 mg kg, 10 mg kg and 2.5 mg kg to each mouse of the first, second and third groups once a day for 10 days running. Thereafter, the lifeprolongation and healing effects of the present substance was evaluated. In addition, only the aqueous physiological saline solution was administered in the same manner as in the other groups to the fourth group the control group . The life prolongation effect was obtained from the following formula Life prolongation rate 1 1 C1 x 100 C1 wherein T1 is the average survival days of the test group andC1 is the average survival days of the control group. The healing effect was evaluated by the number of cured animals, namely the number of animals which survived for 60 days after the transplantadon without retention of ascites.

Where the nitrogen containing polys accharide obtained according to the present invention is used as an anti tumour agent, it can be used by itself or in the form of a pharmaceutical composition also comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. The nitrogen containing polysaccharide can be administered orally or parenterally as a form of administration unit. It can be administered in the form of, for example, a powder, granules, tablet or capsules for oral administration or injection for parenteral administration. The following Examples illustrate the present invention, EXAMPLE 1 200 ml of a liquid medium of a composition consisting of 10 g of polypepton, 5 g of yeast extract, 30 g of glucose and one litre of water and adjusted to pH of 5.5 was charged into each of 50 conical flasks of 500 ml capacity. After plugging up the flask with a cotton stopper and sterilizing the flask for 15 min at 1200C, mycelia of Cordyceps ophioqlossoides Fr lFO 8992 FERM BP 128 , which had been preliminarily slant cultured in a potato dextrose agar culture medium to which has been added a 0.3 yeast extract, were inoculated into the culture medium in each flask. The thus inoculated mycelia were cultured in a stationary state for 5 days at 23 to 270C.They were successively cultured in a shaking state on a rotating table of 180 r.p.m. for 6 days at the same temperature as above to obtain 10 litres of a highly viscous cultured material in total. 10 Litres of hot water was added to the thus obtained cultured material. After stirring the mixture in a mixer, the well mixed mixture was subjected to centrifugal separation at 10,000 G for 20 min to remove the mycelia in the mixture, thereby obtaining a transparent viscous liquid.A mixture 1 1 by weight of activated carbon and celite which had been preliminarily washed with concentrated hydrochloric acid, washed well with water, washed with ethanol and then with acetone and dried, was added to the viscous liquid in an amount of 4 by weight. The mixture was stirred for 16 hours at room temperature. After dialyzing the filtrate of the thus stirred mixture against distilled water for 48 hours at 500C, the dialyzate was freeze dried to obtain 25.0 gof a greyishwhite powdery substance. The thus obtained powdery substance was a nitrogencontaining polysaccharide. The anti tumour activity of the thus obtained substance tested against Sarcoma 180 solid tumour cells transplanted into female ICR JCL mice 6 weeks old at a daily dose rate of 500 mg kg body weight for 10 days running showed a rate of inhibition of proliferation of the transplanted tumour cells of as high as 83.5 . EXAMPLE 2 100 ml of a liquid medium of a composition consisting of 5 g of polypepton, 3 g of yeast extract, 30 g of sucrose, each 0.5 g of potassium dihydrogen phosphate and dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, 0.3 g of magnesium chloride, 0.05 g of manganese chloride and one litre of water adjusted to pH of 5.5 was introduced into each of 50 conical flasks of 500 ml in capacity. After plugging the flask with a cotton stopper and sterilizing for 15 min at 1200C, mycelia of Cordyceps ophioqlossoides Fr lFO 8992 FERM BP 128 , which had been preliminarily slant cultured in a agar culture medium, were inoculated into the culture medium in the flasks. The mycelia were cultured in a stationary state for 6 days at 250C. On the other hand, 10 litres of a medium of the same composition as above were introduced into a jarfermenter of 20 litres in capacity. After sterilizing for 30 min at 1200C and cooling, the above mentioned cultured material in the conical flasks was transplanted into the culture medium in the jar fermenter. After culturing the mixture in a stationary state for 2 days at 25 C, it was further cultured under agitation of 250 r.p.m. while blowing air into the medium at a flow rate of 0.4 volumes of the total liquid volume per min for 7 days. After diluting the thus obtained cultured material with the same volume of distilled water and heating the diluted material at 800C for 30 min, the mixture was filtered using a filter cloth to remove the mycelia in the cultured material. The thus obtained transparent and highly viscous filtrate was mixed with 10 by volume ofAmberlite XAD 2, under agitation for 2 hours at room temperature. After removing the Amberlite XAD 2 from the mixture, the supernatant liquid was freeze dried to obtain 25.5 g of a greyish white powdery substance. The thus obtained powdery substance was a nitrogen containing polysaccharide mainly consisting of glucose units. Its anti tumour activity examined as in Example 1 showed a rate of inhibition of the proliferation of transplantedSarcoma 180 solid tumour cells of 83.5 at a daily dose rate of intraperitoneal administration of 50 mg kg. EXAMPLE 3 A solution of 0.5 w v concentration of the nitrogen containing polysaccharide obtained in Example 1 was prepared by dissolving it in 0.01 M of citric acid. The osmotic pressure of the thus obtained solution was adjusted to 1.0 by addition of sodium chloride. The thus obtained solution was sterilized for 15 minutes at a temperature of 120 0C to form an injectible pharmaceutical composition.
