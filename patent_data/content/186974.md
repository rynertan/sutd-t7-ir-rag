# Integrated circuit for checking boundaries.

## Abstract
A bounds checker is provided consisting of a pair of comparators that each compare a 16 bit number with a lower and an upper limit stored in registers. The device is preferably constructed as a single integrated circuit chip employing emitter coupled logic ECL circuitry and can be made externally compat ible with either transistor transistor logic TTL circuitry or ECL circuitry. The device can be cascaded to operate on extended precision numbers and has a pin which can be used to select comparison of numbers either as signed two s complement numbers or as unsigned numbers. No added gate delay is imposed by the device s ability to operate either type of number.
