# COMPOSITE STRIP FOR LABELLING

## Abstract
A composite strip for preparation of a substrate edge for application of labels is disclosed. The composite strip comprises an elongated carrier web having an upper surface and a lower surface with the lower surface having a pressure sensitive adhesive backing covered with a removable release sheet. A high tensile strength film, such as that sold under the trademark Mylar by DuPont, is directly bonded to the upper surface of the carrier web by a further adhesive. This film provides a receptor surface for receiving labels. The film is of a width equal to or less than the width of the carrier web and of a width to receive a label therein. This composite strip has proven useful in preparing a substrate, such as an existing file folder tab or the edge of an x ray jacket for the subsequent application of a discrete series of labels applied about the edge of the substrate. Such discrete series of labels may also be applied to the composite strip before its application to the edge of the substrate. The composite strip is also advantageously used in combination with a tab extension to provide an add on tab assembly.
