# A silencer for pneumatic equipment.

## Abstract
The silencer, particularly suitable for use with either a pneumatic gun for forcibly inserting fixing elements such as nails, metal staples and similar, or other items of pneumatic equipment, is constituted by a casing 5, open at the lower extremity 5a made to communicate with the source 2 and 2a of compressed gases, and closed at the top by a cover 6, inside which are placed, from the bottom upwards, a first element 10, a filter 15 or 55 and a second element 17 which, jointly with the inside surface of the casing 5, define a first, a second and a third expansion chamber, 12, 22 and 32, respectively, for the compressed gases. The first expansion chamber 12 communicates with the open extremity 5a of the casing, the second 22 contains the aforementioned filter 15 or 55, while the third 32, via a slit 7 made in the cover 6, communicates with the outside. The first and second expansion chambers, 12 and 22, respectively, are inter communicating because of through holes 13 drilled in the first element 10, and likewise the second and third expansion chamber, 22 and 32, respectively, are inter communicating because of through holes 18 drilled in the second element 17.
