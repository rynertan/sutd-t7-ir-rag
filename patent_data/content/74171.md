# Tool assembly.

## Abstract
A tool assembly comprises a piston 1 , a sleeve 2 around the piston 1 , the piston 1 and sleeve 2 being correspondingly apertured 4,5 to receive a locking pin not shown , and a tool holder 6 abutting an end face of the piston 1 and an opposing face of the sleeve 1 so as to be a tight fit between said faces. The tool holder 6 forms a relatively small volume of metal thereby facilitating brazing of the tool bits 12 and inexpensive replacement.
