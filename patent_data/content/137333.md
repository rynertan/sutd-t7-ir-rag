## Description
This invention relates to novel Spiro tricyclicaromatic succinimide derivatives and related spiro heterocyclic analogs such as spiro tricyclicaromatic thiazolidine dione, imidazolidinedione, and oxazolidine dione derivatives and more particularly to the compounds defined by claim 1, compositions containing such a compound as well as more of such compounds for the treatment of complications of diabetes mellitus in humans and animals. As disclosed in US A 3 821 383, aldose reductase inhibitors such as 1,3 dioxo 1 Published EP A O 065 392 describes pharmaceutical compositions containing spiro succinimide derivatives which are useful in the treatment or prophylaxis of the side effects of diabetes or galactosemia. The compounds disclosed in this European application, however, contain different substituents on the rings and contain a central 6 membered ring as opposed to the central 5 membered ring of the present invention. US A 4 127 665 discloses thienohydantoin derivatives useful as aldose reductase inhibitors. The spirohydantoin disclosed in this patent, however, contains only two condensed rings and differs from the present invention in the basic ring systems. In contrast to this prior art, the invention provides a novel series of spiro tricyclicaromatic succinimide derivatives and related spiro heterocyclic analogs, which compounds are useful as inhibitors of aldose reductase and alleviators of diabetes mellitus complications. The invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions which may be used for inhibiting aldose reductase and the treatment of diabetes mellitus wherein the active ingredient comprises a spiro tricyclicaromatic succinimide derivative or spiro heterocyclic analog. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent as the description thereof proceeds. The compounds of the present invention are inhibitors of the enzyme aldose reductase and, while applicant is not bound by any theory, the pharmaceutical utility of the compounds of the present invention appears to correlate with their observed aldose reductase inhibitory property. The inhibition of the enzyme aldose reductase and related reductases results in the inhibition of abnormal polyol accumulation at the expense of NADPH in those tissues containing aldose reductase and or related aldehyde reductases. The inhibition of the formation of a polyol, such as sorbitol or galactitol, arising from the reduction of an aldose, such as glucose or galactose respectively, is believed beneficial to delay the progression of certain complications arising from hyperglycemia or hypergalactocemia. Hyperglycemia is associated with the complications of neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, cataract, glaucoma, and impaired wound healing in diabetes mellitus patients. According to US A 3 821 383, aldose reductase inhibitors such as 1,3 dioxo 1 As a result, the compounds of the present invention are of significant value as aldose reductase inhibitors, since it is already known in the art that aldose reductase inhibitors prevent diabetic cataract, nerve tissue damage, and certain vascular changes. In accordance with the present invention, it has been surprisingly found that various spirocyclic imide containing derivatives of the tricycle fluorene and related hetereocyclic analogs of fluorene and their derivatives are extremely useful as inhibitors of aldose reductase, espescially human aldose reductase. In a more preferred embodiment, the spiro cyclic aromatic imides of the present invention are of the follwing general formula wherein A, B, U, X, Y, R¹, R², R³, Z, and t are as defined in claim 1. In the compounds of Formula I, Rings A and B are attached to the central five membered ring at positions 1,2 and 3,4. In more preferred embodiments, the cycloalkyl groups have 4 to 7 carbon atoms and lower alkyl groups have 1 to 6 carbon atoms. In an especially preferred embodiment, Ring A is selected from Ring B is selected from and In those instances where, according to general Formulae I and I A, A does not equal B, the spiro carbon is chiral. Activity of any such racemic mixture may be attributable to only one isomer. Resolution, or direct synthesis, of the enantiomers, as is known in the art, is recognized as a method to isolate or prepare the active or the more active enantiomer. It is also recognized that certain patterns of substitution on A and or B according to Formulae I and I A may create asymmetry, and the resulting diastereomeric mixtures may be separated by chromatography or solvent recrystallizations, as is known and practiced in the art. For example, if A has a methylsulfoxyl substituent and A is different from B, then there are at least two chiral centers the spiro carbon and the sulfoxide sulfur. Physical separation of this diastereomeric mixture by chromatography or other methods practiced in the art will yield two racemic mixtures, each containing a pair of enantiomers. Stereospecific oxidation of a methylsulfide on A to yield a methylsulfoxide e.g., vis sodium metaperiodate and albumin when A is different than B according to Formula I will yield a diastereomeric mixture, which then can be separated by conventional physical methods known in the art, such as liquid chromatography or differential solvent solubility, to yield the purified diastereomers which are themselves purified optical isomers. Reduction of the two optically active sulfoxide diastereomers will yield the optically active pair of enantiomers or mirror image isomers. Of special interest in this invention are typical and preferred specie of Formula I such as these racemic mixtures spiro 6 fluoro 4 Also of special interest in this invention are these achiral or nonracemic compounds spiro 2,7 difluoro 9 The novel compounds of the present invention are readily prepared from appropriate ketones of Formula II of their methylene analogs of Formula III wherein A and B are previously defined with the exception that introduction of a nitro substituent s is conducted after hydantoin derivatization. Similarly, certain other derivatizations, e.g., esterification of carboxylic acids, oxidation of alkyl sulfides to sulfoxides or sulfones and direct aromatic halogenations may be conveniently performed after the tricyclic aromatic is spiro imide derivatized, e.g., converted to the hydantoin or thiazolidinedione. In addition, certain labile protecting groups may be employed as is known and practiced in the art. The four major derivatization methods to transform tricycles of Formulas II and III into derivatives of Formula I follow. The novel spiro hydantoin derivatives of the present invention are readily prepared from appropriate ketones of Formula II, wherein A and B are previously defined. For example, spiro imidazolidinedione derivatives 29 and 41 are prepared respectively from 5 Similarly, spiro imidazolidinedione derivative 39 is prepared from its starting muterial ketone 8 To synthesize a spiro imidazolidinedione derivative, the ketone in Formula II is condensed with an alkali metal cyanide, such as potassium cyanide, and ammonium carbonate. The reaction is typically conducted in the presence of a ketone solubilizing inert polar organic solvent which include, but is not limited to, water miscible alcohols such as ethanol and isopropanol, lower alkylene glycols such as ethylene glycol and trimethylene glycol, N, N di lower alkyl , lower alkanoamides such as N,N dimethyl formamide, acetamide. In general, the reaction is conducted at temperatures ranging from 60 C to about 180 C preferably 100 C to 130 C for 6 hours to about 4 days, depending upon the ketone, solvent and temperature used. In general reagents in this reaction are employed in excess of stoichiometric amounts to provide maximum conversion of the ketone substrate to the spirohydantoin derivative. For example, a moderate excess of potassium cyanide i.e., 1.1 equiv and a 1.5 to 4 fold excess of ammonium carbonate achieves an increased yield of spirohydantoin derivative based upon ketone starting material. Reaction ketone substrates of Formula II are prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art. Typical preparative methods for substrate ketones are represented by, but are not limited to, examples in Table A and in the example preparations which follow. The novel spiro tricyclicthiazolidinedione derivatives of the present invention ire readily prepared from appropriate fluorene and heterocyclic analogs of fluorene derivatives of Formula III, wherein A and B are previously defined. For example, spiro thiazolidinedione derivative 26 is prepared from 5 Likewise, the spiro thiazolidinedione of example 12 is prepared from its starting material 2 fluoro 9 The synthesis of a spiro thiazolidinedione from the corresponding tricyclic fluorene or heterocyclic fluorene derivative is a multi stepped synthesis as depicted in Example IV. The first step involves metalation with a lower alkyl lithium reagent such as n butyllithium in an inert aprotic solvent such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran under an inert atmosphere of nitrogen or argon, e.g., metalation of 2 fluoro 9 Metalation occurs primarily at the methylene bridge. Reaction with carbon dioxide results in carbonation of the bridge carbon to yield upon isolation the carboxylic acid, e.g., 2 fluoro 9 Isolation of the carboxylic acid derivative can be accomplished by a process including acidification, simple column chromatography and solvent recrystallization similar to the process cited in Example IV. In contrast to this general case, metalation and carbonation of 8 Proton abstraction from the acidic methine bridge of the carboxylic ester by in alkali alkoxide such as sodium metal in methanol or alkali hydride such as potassium hydride in DMSO or DMF generates a carbanion. Introduction of purified dry oxygen results in oxidation of the methine carbon. Bisulfite reduction and a simple work up involving filtration results in the isolation of an α hydroxy ester product, e.g., 2 fluoro 9 hydroxy 9 α Halogenation of the α hydroxy ester by a thionyl halide such as thionyl chloride at reflux transforms 2 fluoro 9 hydroxy 9 In a typical work up procedure the cooled reaction mixture is diluted with benzene or a similar inert solvent, is known to those skilled in the art, and the solution is evaporated with reduced pressure and heat to yield the α halo ester. The α halo ester, e.g., 9 chloro 2 fluoro 9 Hydrolysis of the spiro aminothiazolone in an acidic aqueous alcoholic solution such as concentrated hydrochloric acid in methanol yields the spiro thiazolidinedione, e.g., spiro 2 fluoro 9 Reaction starting materials, tricyclic fluorene and tricyclic heterocyclic flourene derivatives of Formula III, are prepared by methods known to those skilled in the art. Typical preparative methods are represented by, but are not limited to, preparation examples of Table A and in the examples which later follow. The novel spiro tricyclic oxazolidinedione derivatives of the present invention are readily prepared from appropriate derivatives of flourene and heterotricyclic analogs of fluorene of Formula III, wherein A and B are previously defined. The synthesis of the spiro oxazolidinediones and spiro thiazolidinediones see II generally have common synthetic intermediates. For example, spiro tricyclic oxazolidinedione derivative 6 is prepared from the tricyclic α hydroxy ester, 2 fluoro 9 hydroxy 9 Similarly, other tricyclic α hydroxy esters known in the art are derived from the appropriate fluorene derivitives and heterotricyclic analogs of fluorene derivatives, as are represented in but not limited by those examples cited in Table A and in the following example preparations, can be utilized to prepare spiro tricyclicoxazolidinediones according to this general scheme M alkali metal cation e.g., Na The novel spiro tricyclicsuccinimide derivatives of the instant invention are readily prepared from appropriate fluorene derivatives and heterocyclic analogs of fluorene of Formula III, wherein A and B are previously defined. The synthesis of the spiro tricyclicsuccinimides, spiro oxazolidinediones and spiro thiazolidinediones generally have common synthetic intermediates. For example, spiro tricyclicsuccinimide derivatives 20 and 21 are prepared from the tricyclic acid esters, 9 Similarly, other tricycliccarboxylic acid eaters known in the art are derived from the fluorene derivatives and heterotricyclic analogs of fluorene and derivatives, as are represented in but not limited to those examples cited in Table A and in the following example preparations can be utilized to prepare spiro tricyclicsuccinimides according to this general scheme M alkali metal cation e.g., Na , K Halogenation of fluorene and fluorenone and related indeno heterocycle analogs such as 4 azafluorene or 4 azafluorenone and as exampled in Table A where Q is dihydrogen and oxygen can be accomplished by methods known and practiced in the art e.g., Eckert and Langecker, The structure reactivity of tricyclic azines, nitrogen analogs of fluorenone and fluorene, to electrophillic halogenation has bean characterized by Mlochowski and Szulc, Fluorination of selected derivatives of fluorene and fluorenone and indeno heterocyclic analogs involves a multistepped process wherein the substrate is first nitrated Kretor and Litvinov, where B is a previously defined are derivatized to the corresponding arylisopropanoic and arylacetic acids. The process involves the following synthetic steps M A serial process involving several of the aformentioned processes can be employed to introduce for example a fluoro, and a chloro substituent into the same tricyclcic aromatic substrate. Other fluorene and fluorenone derivatives and indeno heterocyclic analog derivatives can be prepared in accordance with common synthetic procedures known and practiced in the art. Finally, tricyclic aromatic azine derivative such as 5 Nitrated fluorenone will not easily derivatize to form the corresponding spiro hydantoin. The preferred method of preparation of spiro hydantoin aromatic nitro derivatives is via direct nitration e.g., via nitric acid and 60 sulfuric acid of the spiro cyclic derivatives, especially spiro hydantoin see Example XI . After nitration of the selected spiro tricyclic imidazolidinediones, thiazolidinediones, oxazolidinediones and succinimides by methods well known and practiced in the art, the corresponding aromatic nitro group s of corresponding spiro tricyclic derivative s of the present invention can be reduced to the corresponding amine derivative s . Aromatic nitro group s reduction to the aromatic amime s can be accomplished by a number of methods including reduction by hydrazine hydrate and Raney Nickel see Fletcher and Namkung, Spiro tricyclic azine derivative, such as spiro 7 fluoro 5 The spiro tricyclic thiazolidinedione, imidazolidinedione, oxazolidinedione and succinimide compounds of the present invention are weak acids. In addition, several examples, as cited in Example XIX, are carboxylic acid derivatives and or aromatic azines i.e., contain a basic nitrogen s in the aromatic tricycle and or contain an alkylamine substituent. Therefore, these compounds are ameanble to preparation as base salts and in some cases, where basic amines are present, acid salts. Several examples contain both an acidic spiro functionality and carboxylic acid functionality. These cases can be prepared as mono or di basic salts. The chemical bases which are used as reagents to prepare the aforementioned pharmaceutically acceptable base salts are those which form nontoxic pharmaceutically acceptable salts with the various heroin described acidic spiro imidazolidinedione, thiazolidine dione, oxazolidinedione and succinimdie derivatives such as spiro 7 fluoro 5 Acid salts of spiro tricyclic azine derivatives, e.g., spiro 7 fluoro 5 As previously indicated, the spiro tricyclic thiazolidinedione, imidazolidinedione, oxazolidinedione and succinimide compounds of this invention are all readily adapted to therapeutic use as aldose reductase inhibitors for the control of chronic diabetic complications, in view of their ability to reduce lens sorbitol levels in diabetic subjects to a statistically significant degree. The herein described compounds of this invention can be administered by either the oral or parenteral routes of administration. In general, these compounds are ordinarily administered in dosages ranging from about 0.1 mg to about 10 mg kg of body weight per day, although variations will necessarily occur depending upon the weight and condition of the subject being treated and the particular route of administration chosen the preferred range is 0.5 to 4.0 mg kg.

For purposes of oral administration, tablets containing various excipients such as sodium citrate, calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate may be employed along with various disintegrants such as starch and preferably potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid and certain complex silicates, together with binding agents such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often very useful for tabletting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules preferred materials in this connection would also include lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions and or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the essential active ingredient therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter of dyes, and if so desired, emulsifying and or suspending agents as well, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various like combinations thereof. For purposes of parenteral administration, solutions of those particular spiro tricycles in sesame or peanut oil or in aqueous propylene glycol may be employed, as well as sterile aqueous solutions of the corresponding water soluble, alkali metal or alkaline earth metal or acid salts previously enumerated. Such aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose.
