# Demodulation with error detecting capability.

## Abstract
In a demodulator for recovering data from a frequency modulated data signal having clock peaks and data peaks read from a record medium, error detection is accomplished by checking the occurrence of the peaks of the signal relative to three windows. The time lengths of the windows are varied after each clock peak so that they are proportionally related to a length of interval between a clock peak and the preceding one.
