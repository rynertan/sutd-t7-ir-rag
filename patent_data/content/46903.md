# Apparatus for manufacturing slide fastener chains having solid sections.

## Abstract
An apparatus for manufacturing a fastener chain having solid sections by repeating the steps of providing a tape having perforated sections which include holes punched in a longitudinal edge of the tape, and solid sections, which are free of holes, alternating with the perforated sections, supplying the tape so that the perforated section thereof is placed between a stationary mold and movable mold, applying tension to the tape to stretch it, and then injection molding fastener elements onto the tape at the holes. Stretching of the tape is accomplished by a sprocket wheel provided adjacent a freely rotatable drum. Teeth on the circumferential surface of the sprocket wheel are caused to recede below the circumferential surface of the freely rotatable drum when a solid section of the tape passes over the drum.
