# FABRIC CLEANER

## Abstract
The invention provides a carpet cleaning composition and dispensing means which use foam producing surfactants, sol vents, propellants, builders and water. Other adjuncts may be added, such as fragrances, dyes, and fabric softeners. The invention also provides a method for cleaning soiled fabrics having fibers containing soiling particles which com prises a applying to said fibers an aqueous, solvent surfactant admixture having a solvent with consistent evaporation rate in ambient air b collapsing without abrasion said mixture into said fibers and emulsifying and segregating said soiling particles during a controlled residence time and c evaporating said solvent so as to form said admixture into a foam, elevating said soiling particles substantially to the surface of said fibers and compositions directed to the same.
