# Process for setting a polychloroprene latex.

## Abstract
Delayed action setting of a composition comprising an anionic latex of a film forming polymer by addition of a delayed action setting agent characterised in that the setting agent is a compound containing a multivalent metal cation having defined solubility characteristics in a quantity not greater than 2.5 wt wt on total composition and not greater than 11 wt wt based on film forming polymer solids in the composition.
