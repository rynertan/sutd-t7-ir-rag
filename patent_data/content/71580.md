# INGOT MOULD WITH TUBULAR CRYSTALLIZER

## Abstract
The invention concerns an ingot mould 10 with a tubular crystallizer for continuous horizontal casting, said ingot mould including in coordinated cooperation a replaceable tubular crystallizer 20 having a modest thickness and located in the inner part of the ingot mould 10 , a tubular cooling sleeve 30 which is located in the outer part of the ingot mould 10 and forms a cooling interspace 33 around the tubular crystallizer 20 , whereby each end of said tubular sleeve 30 is provided with an annular chamber 36 communicating with said interspace 33 , and circular crown means 40 which are located in the end of the ingot mould 10 near the channel feeding the liquid metal and which are able to connect the end of the tubular crystallizer 20 to the end of the tubular cooling sleeve 30 , whereby said circular crown means 140 are provided with a plurality of cooling ducts 42 which connect the interspace 33 to the annular chamber 36 envisaged in said end.
