# Waveform data display.

## Abstract
Acquired sampled waveform data is displayed on a screen as a busform, wherein a change of state in the waveform during a sampling interval is represented by a solid block character on the screen, and wherein the lack of a change of state in any of the channels during a sampling interval is represented by a space character of the same width as the block character. The blocks and spaces repre senting contiguous sampling intervals are of the same width and are displayed in horizontal sequence across the screen such that the time between state changes is graphically represented by the horizontal distance between the blocks. Numbers indicating the associated waveform state are displayed when possible in the space or spaces following each block character.
