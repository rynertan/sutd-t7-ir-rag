## Description
METHOD OF MEASURING POLYNUCLEOTIDE AND REAGENT KIT FOR FOR USE THEREIN This invention relates to a method of measuring polynucleotide, i.e. deoxyribonucleic acid DNA or ribonucleic acid RNA , in a fluid sample, in particular a body fluid. The measurement of a DNA in a sample of human serum provides significant results when testing for a viral infection or a hereditary disease. A conventional method of detecting a particular DNA comprises denaturing of a double stranded DNA d DNA in a sample under investigation to produce a single stranded DNA s DNA , immobilising the s DNA on a carrier material, hybridising the immobilised s DNA with a radioisotope labelled s DNA, removing unreacted radioisotope labelled s DNA, and then measuring radioactivity of the immobilised material.Since this method comprises many processes including immobilisation of each sample, it is complicated to carry out and hence the procedure is time consuming. It is an object of this invention to provide a simpler method of measuring a polynucleotide. According to this invention, there is provided a method of measuring a polynucleotide which is either single stranded as such or a single stranded polynucleotide obtained from a double stranded polynucleotide to be measured, which comprises, contacting the single stranded polynucleotide to be measured with an immobilised labelled single stranded polynucleotide which is able to hybridise with said single stranded polynucleotide in aqueous solution to produce a double stranded polynucleotide, breaking the double stranded polynucleotide thereby obtained by means of a double stranded polynucleotide restriction enzyme, and measuring the amount of labelling substance in the solution obtained and or on immobilised material, as appropriate as a measure of said single stranded and or said double stranded polynucleotide to be measured. This invention also provides a reagent kit for use in said method comprising the aforesaid immobilised labelled single stranded polynucleotide and a restriction enzyme. The method of this invention uses as starting material a single stranded polynucleotide, hereinafter termed s polynucleotide to be measured, which may be derived from a double stranded polynucleotide in which case its quantity is a measure of the polynucleotide from which it has been obtained. The s polynucleotide to be measured may be s DNA or s KNA. When the fundamental polynucleotide in a sample to be determined is double stranded, it is necessary that the polynucleotide be denatured by alkaline treatment using a sodium hydroxide solution or heating to convert it to single stranded polynucleotide. Test materials which may be subjected to this method include human serum, urine and tissue extracts. When a protein is combined with the polynucleotide in a sample, such as serum, the protein is preferably separated off by using, for example, a protease. The immobilised single stranded polynucleotide labelled s polynucleotide incorporates or has bound thereto a labelling substance and is able to hybridise with the s polynucleotide to be measured. Hence, this labelled s polynucleotide acts as a probe which can hyridise with the s polynucleotide to be measured. The s polynucleotide to be labelled may be produced by denaturation of a double stranded polynucleotide containing the s polynucleotide to be measured by means of alkaline treatment or heating. It may also be produced by a known solid phase polynucleotide synthesis method or by a genetic synthesis method accomplished with y DNA using a plasmid. Some s polynucleotides have, in themselves, found commercial use. The labelling substance which is used may be a radioisotope, a fluorescent material, a luminescent material, a magnetic material, an enzyme, a prosthetic group of such an enzyme, a coenzyme, or an enzyme inhibitor or activator. Radioisotopes which may be used include 32p 3H 35S 14C and 125I. Fluorescent materials which may be used include fluorescent reagents, such as rhodamine, fluorescein, methylcoumarin and dansyl chloride. Luminescent materials which may be used include chemically luminescent materials such as isoluminol and luminol, and a biologically luminescent material such as luciferine luciferase. Enzymes, for example glucose oxidase, peroxidase and alkaline phosphates, whose activities can easily be measured are preferably used.Since processes for measuring a polynucleotide include heating, the enzyme is preferably thermostable. Should an enzyme which is not thermostable be used, hybridisation may also be carried out at 35 to 400C. Prosthetic groups include flavine adenine dinucleotide which is an active site of a glucose oxidase, and its amount can be determined by measuring the activity of a holoenzyme after reaction with an apoenzyme. Coenzymes which may be used, include NADH,NADPH2, aminopyrophosphate, pyridoxal phosphate, ADP andATP. The carrier material of the labelled s polynucleotide may be Sepharose, Sephadex RegisteredTrade Marks , cellulose gel, ion exchange resin, filter paper, nitrocellulose, nylon, polystyrene or polyacrylamide. Immobilisation may be carried out by following a general immobilisation method or a general polynucleotide synthesis route. In such a procedure, an oligonucleotide is first allowed to bind to a carrier material, and then, the s polynucleotide is allowed to bind to the oligonucleotide by using a 3 nucleotidase.An amino group or carboxyl group is introduced to the s polynucleotide, and then it is allowed to bind to a carrier material having carboxyl groups or amino groups by using a reagent for peptide synthesis such as dicyclohexyl carbodiimide or carbonyldiimidazole. When both the s polynucleotide and a carrier material have amino groups, they can be combined by using for example cyanuric chloride or glutaraldehyde. When both the materials contain SH groups, they can be combined by using a reductant or a reagent having maleimide group.A physical adsorption method may also be employed for the immobilisation. For example, nitrocellulose is immersed in a solution of the s polynucleotide for a prescribed time and then washed. Finally, the immobilised product may also be produced by connecting nucleotides successively on a carrier material using a solid phase synthesis method. Introduction of the labelling substance into the s polynucleotide may be carried out by following a conventional method. The introduction is usually carried out prior to the immobilisation. However, when the labelling substance is a large molecule like an enzyme, the introduction is preferably carried out after the immobilisation. The s polynucleotide to be measured is contacted with the labelled s polynucleotide in the solution phase.The contacting time is usually about 0.5 to 40 hours.The temperature of the solution is preferably from 20 to 700C, and the pH is usually 5 to 9. The double stranded polynucleotide restriction enzyme then used hereinafter abbreviated as restriction enzyme is preferably one which is specific for double stranded polynucleotides, and preferably recognises a short polynucleotide chain. Moreover two or more different restriction enzymes may be employed. The restriction enzyme is usually added to the solution after the hybridisation, although it may be added together with or prior to the s polynucleotide to be measured. After the restriction enzyme reaction, the immobilised material is separated from the solution, if necessary, and the residual labelling substance in the solution or of the immobilised material, as appropriate, is measured. The measurement may be carried out by a known method. For example, radioactivity of this material may be determined by using a scintillation counter or a Geiger counter in the case of a radioisotope labelling element. Characteristically, the method of the invention does not need the immobilisation of the s polynucletide to be measured, and is easy to carry out. Instead, standard reagents, and optionally devices, can be made available as a kit. A polynucleotide such as DNA can then be easily detected or determined by using this kit. . The following Examples illustrate this invention EXAMPLE 1 1 Preparation of HBV DNA Probe 500 ml of a pool serum from chronic B type hepatitis patients were centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 15 minutes, and the supernatant was further centrifuged 0 using an ultracentrifuge at 4 C at 100,000 xg for 5 hours to collect HBV particles as a pellet. This pellet was dissolved in 10 ml of 0.01 M tris HCl buffer solution of pH 7.5 containing 0.1 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 by weight 2 mercaptoethanol and 0.1 by weight of BSA. 5 ml of the virus solution were stored, and the remaining 5 ml were centrifuged at 100,000 xg for 5 hours to obtain a pellet again.

Then, the solution was layered over 30 by weight sucrose solution placed in a centrifuge tube, and centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 3 hours using a SW 65 rotor made by Beckman Co. to obtain a pellet. This pellet was treated with a protease, and two extractions from the solution were carried each with phenol.The extracts were combined and placed on 5 to 20 by weight sucrose solution gradient, and centrifuged 32 at 50,000 rpm for 3 hours. 15 S PDNA fractions were collected, and pooled. 15 S32PDNA was precipitated from the pooled fractions by adding ethanol, and dried to obtain the target HBV DNA. 2 Preparation of DNA Probe by Nick Translation 1 vg of the above HBV DNA was added to 100 p1 of 50 mM tris HCl buffer solution of pH 7.5 containing 5 mM MgC12, 10 mM 2 mercaptoethanol, 5 MdTTP, 5 lJMdGTP, 5 UM 32P dCTP relative radioctivity 100 700 Ci mmol and 5 32P dATP relative radioactivity 100 700 Ci mmol .100 pg DNase I and 100 pg DNA polymeriase I were added to the solution which was incubated at 150C for 90 minutes.Extraction of radioactive HBV D DNA from the solution was carried out by using phenol, and the extract was purified by using a Sephadex G 50 column. 1 mg of this HBV d DNA 1 ml was mixed with 5 mg of single stranded M13 phage DNA 2 ml . 8 ml of formamide were added to the mixture which was then boiled for 5 minutes. Subsequently, 2 ml of 0.07 M tris HCl buffer solution containing commat M M NaCl and 15 mM EDTA pH 7.5 were added to the solution which was then warmed at 500C for 4 hours and then at 60 0C for 1 hour. The reaction mixture obtained was separated by gel filtration using Bio Gel A50 m, and hybridised DNA and unreacted DNA were removed. The first peak fraction near the void fraction was collected, and NaCl powder was dissolved therein in a concentration of 0.1 M. 100 ethanol in a volume twice that of the solution was added, and the solution obtained allowed to stand at 70 0C for 2 hours. Subsequently, the solution was centrifuged at 17,000 xg for 10 minutes, and the precipitates which formed were collected. The precipitates were dissolved in 50 ml of 0.001 Phenol Red solution containing 0.1 N NaOH and 0.25 mM EDTA, and purified by gel filtration using Bio Gel A50 to obtain the target HBV s DNA. Meanwhile, 1 pg HBV, 100 pg DNase I and 100 pg DNA polymerase I were added to 100 ijl of 50 mM tris HCl buffer solution of pH 7.5 containing 5 mM MgC12, 10 mM 2 mercaptoethanol, 5 MdTTP, 5 pMdGTP, 5 vMdCTP, 5 UMdATP, 10 pM aminohexyl dATP and 10 uM aminohexyl dCTP and the solution was incubated at 150C for 90 minutes.Extraction from the solution was carried out by using phenol, and the extract was purified by using SephadexG 50 column to obtain a modified HBV d DNA. This d DNA was converted to s DNA by following the aforementioned procedure. 3 Preparation of Immobilised Material A polyuracil nucleotide was allowed to bind toCNBr activated Sepharose gel beads. The radioactiveHBV s DNA was added to the gel beads, and the 3 terminal position of the polyuracil was allowed to bind to 5 terminal position of the radioactive HBV DNA by addingRNA ligase. The gel beads were sufficiently washed with 50 dimethylformamide containing 0.2 M NaCl to yield the required immobilised material. 1.0 ml of d DNA restriction enzyme solution BglII, Ava II, Hae II, Hae III, Hap 11, Hinc II each 1U ml, 10 mM tris HCl, 7 mM MgCl2, 70 mM NaCl, 7 mM 2 mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5 was added to the immobilised 0 material, and allowed to react at 37 C for 1 hour.
