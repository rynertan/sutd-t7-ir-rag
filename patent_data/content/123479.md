# Synthetic yarn and yarn like structures and a method and apparatus for their production.

## Abstract
In forming yarn and yarn like structures separate multifi lament strands 1, 2, 3 of thermoplastics material are treated so that at least one 2, 3 has a shrinkage ratio higher than normal at an elevated temperature. The strands are inter mingled in a gas stream with formation of loops 21 on the strands, the yarn so produced is subjected to a twisting force and is then heated to cause the filaments to shrink differen tially while being held to a predetermined length, then cooled while being held until shrinkage ceases. The yarn produced is highly flexible, of uniform cross section and shows no tendency for the strands to separate. It has also a high degree of softness and tenacity.
