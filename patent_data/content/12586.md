# Apparatus for heat shrinking a plastics film around goods stacked on a pallet.

## Abstract
In an apparatus for shrinking of a shrink film hood around goods stacked on a pallet, heat radiation elements and reflec tors, serving to heat the film hood, are mounted in a gallow shaped rod with a U shaped cross section. The said rod is suspended from an endless chain and can be moved around the stacked goods in a quadrangle movement, being guided in such manner that it turns 90 when a corner is passed in the quadrangular movement. A single round of the gallow shaped rod gives the necessary heating of the shrink film hood.
