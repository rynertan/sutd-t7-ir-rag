# CONTAINER AND CLOSURE

## Abstract
A closure container combination of the type in which the closure is released from the container by tilting the closure by downward pressure on the periphery of the closure comprises a container having a circular sealing rib adjacent its mouth and one or more stop formations which limit the downward movement of the closure on the container. The closure has a skirt which is cylindrical or includes a cylindrical portion and the height of the skirt exceeds the distance between the outwardly projecting rib and the stop formation or formations which provide hinge points about which the closure may be tilted. The skirt of the closure forms an interference fit with the outwardly projecting rib. The stop formation is preferably in the form of a part circular rib extending through 210 270 around the container. The ends of the rib form the hinge points for tilting the closure. The skirt of the closure may include an inwardly extending detent which lies above the level of the stop rib and prevents tilting of the closure except when the detent is aligned with the gap between the ends of the stop rib.
