# Throttle control system for automotive vehicle.

## Abstract
In a throttle control system including electrical elements or devices 3, 4A, 4B , if trouble occurs in these elements, there exists a problem in that the throttle valve 5 is further driven forcibly in spite of the fact that the throttle valve has already been fully closed or opened. To overcome the above problem, a throttle valve close limit switch 7A and a throttle valve open limit switch 7 are additionally provided for the accelerator control system, in order to generate an alarm signal or a system disabling signal in the case where the difference between the target throttle opening rate and the actual throttle opening rate exceeds a predetermined value when one of the limit switches is on.
