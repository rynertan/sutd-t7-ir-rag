# Portable information device.

## Abstract
A pocket sized portable information device for use mainly by Moslems has means for entering information identifying geographical location. Codes identifying geog raphical locations are input via suitable key pads, resulting in geographical co ordinate information being supplied to a microprocessor from a location ROM. The device is also provided with a compass, identifying the direction towards magnetic North. Using the information from the location ROM the microprocessor calculates the diviation from magnetic North to the direction towards Mecca for the location concerned. The device can then be oriented so as to point towards Mecca, i.e. at the correct deviation from magnetic North. An audible output is given when the orientation is correct. The device also includes an oscillator driving a clock calendar and an interrupt timer both of which are linked to the microprocessor. By means of suitable algorithms the microprocessor calculates sunrise, sunset and thus the prayer times for Moslems, and at the appropri ate times provides an audible alarm through an amplifier and a transducer T .
