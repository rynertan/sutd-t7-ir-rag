# Torque multiplier assembly.

## Abstract
A torque multiplier assembly A that is portable, compact, and may be easily and conveniently disposed adjacent a nut, bolt or similar threaded elements to remov ably engage the same. The torque multiplier assembly A when so engaged is adapted to exert a first relatively high maximum torque of predetermined value on the nut, bolts or similar elements to initially rotate the same from binding threaded engagement or perform the final tightening of the nut, bolt or rotatable element. The torque multiplier assem bly A is manually actuated by the use of an elongate torque wrench B of a type that is commercially available and may be adjusted to supply any one of a number of maximum torque. The desired maximum torque supplied by the elongate torque wrench B is relatively low, normally not over fifty foot pounds, and is visually indicated on a calibrated scale 14,15 that forms a part of the torque wrench B . The maximum torque supplied by the torque wrench B is transferred to the multiplier assembly A with the torque output of the multiplier assembly A being the torque input of the torque wrench multiplied by a factor that is inherent to the specific gear structure of the multiplier assembly A .

## Description
The present invention relates to a torque multiplier assembly that is portable, compact, and may be easily and conveniently disposed adjacent a nut, bolt or similar threaded elements to removably engage the same. The present invention may provide a torque multiplier assembly that is capable of exerting the same maximum torque on a nut, bolt head, or other rotatable element, as my prior invention described in U.S. Patent No. 3,564,955 entitled High Torque Wrench Assembly that was granted onFebruary 23, 1971 but one that has the operational advantage that it is more compact, lighter in weight than my prior high torque wrench, and does not require a torque indicating device as a part thereof. The present invention may provide a torque multiplier assembly that is actuated by a conventional elongate low torque output wrench that may be manually adjusted to provide any one of a number of maximum torques and the torque output of the present torque multiplier assembly being the torque input of the torque wrench multiplied by a factor that is inherent to the gear structure of the torque multiplier assembly. The present invention may also provide a torque multiplier assembly that is used only when a relatively torque output is required, and the user of the invention being free to use the lightweight low torque producing wrench in its normal manner when not being used to actuate the torque multiplier assembly. The present invention may also provide a torque multiplier assembly in whicb the torque produced thereby may be more accurately determined as to the magnitude thereof than is possible with the torque wrench described in my previous patent, which prior art invention includes a torque indicating device of the torsion bar type. The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIGURE 1 is a perspective view of the invention fully illustrating one side thereof, and the view also including a low torque output wrench used in actuating the torque multiplier assembly, as well as a stabilizing bar that may be used to maintain the torque multiplier in a fixed position relative to the rotatable element to which torque is being applied FIGURE 2 is a second pèspective view of the torque multiplier assembly illustrating a second side thereof FIGURE 3 is an end elevational view of the torque multiplier assembly FIGURE 4 is a second end elevational view of the torque multiplier assembly with the torque output element removably engaging a socket wrench which, in turn, engages a nut or bolt head of the element that is to be rotated FIGURE 5 is a front elevational view of the torque multiplier assembly FIGURE 6 is a transverse cross sectional view of the torque multiplier assembly taken on the line 6 6 ofFigure 5 and FIGURE 7 is a second transverse cross sectional view of the torque multiplier assembly taken on the line 7 7 of Figure 5. The torque multiplier assembly A of the present invention as may best be seen in FIGS l, 2, 6 and 7 is actuated by a conventional elongate torque wrench 3 that has a head C and the wrench being commercially available. The torque multiplier assembly A is preferably held in a stabilized stationary position when imparting torque to a desired rotatable element by use of a stabiliring rod D shown in FIG. 1 or other anchoring means. The torque wrench t includes an elongate handle 10 that has a rotatable portion 12 that moves longitudinally relative the handle as the portion 12 is rotated. The handle 12 has a first scale 14 over which the free edge portion 12a of the rotatable portion 12 moves as the handle 10 is rotated. The first scale 14 has numbers 14a thereon which indicate the maximum torque that can be applied to a rotatable element by use of the head C. Torque wrenches 3 of the above described type are commercially available and are normally designed to provide not over fifty foot pounds of torque through the head C.The head C includes a torque imparting means 16 which may be either a protuberance of non circular transverse cross section or a recess that is likewise not of circular transverse cross section. The torque imparting means 16 as may be seen in FIG. 6 is adapted to removably engage a torque receiving member 18 as shown in FIG. 6 that is of non circular transverse cross section, and is a part of the torque multiplier assembly A. The torque wrench B is of such structure that when the maximum torque for which it is set is reached the torque wrench becomes inoperative into far as producing additional to que. The torque multiplier assembly A as may be seen in the drawings includes first and second housing half portions E and E that have first and second abutting surfaces 20 and 22. First and second transverse bores 24 and 26 are formed on the peripheral portions of the housing half portions E ana E , with the second bores having threads on the interior thereof that are engaged by cap screws 28 that serve to hold the two housing half portions in abutting contact. The fist and second housing half portions E andE have an opening 30 of substantial diameter extending transversely therethrough, which opening is defined by first circular side walls 32 formed in the first and second housing half portions R and E . The first and second housing half portions E and E have an elongate opening 34 therein that is tangential to the opening 30, with the elongate opening 34 being defined by a second circular side wall within the first and second housing halt portion E dnd E . A heavy torque output shaft 38 is provided that has a longitudinal slot 42 therein that is engaged by a key 40, with the key also engaging a radially aligned slot 44 formed on the interior surface of a cylindrical huS 46 or a worm gear 48 as shown in FIGS. 6 and 7. The worm gear 48 has teeth 50 on the outer periphery thereof. A pair of laterally spaced anti friction foller bearing assemblies 52 are provided, each of which assemblies includes a number of tapered rollers 54 that rotatably engage a bearing cup 56 and bearing cone 58. The shaft 38 as may best be seen in FIG. 7 has a torque output plug 60 of non circular transverse cross section projecting outwardly from one end thereof and a torque output recess 62 extending into the shaft 38 from the opposite end thereof. A pair of oil seals 64 are disposed within the first and second housing portions z and E as shown in FIG. 7 to encircle the shaft 38, with the oil seals being removably ehld in position within the housing portion by a pair of retainer seals 66. A par of retainer rings 68 are provided that abut against the retainer seals 66, and the ret iner rings removably engaging grooves 70 that extend into the first circular side wall 32. The worm gear 48 is held in a fixed longitudinal position on the shaft 38 by a pair of transversely spaced retainer rings 67 that engage grooves 69 formed in the shaft 38. A pair of laterally spaced, anti friction ball bearing assemblies 72 are provided, with each assembly including an outer race 74, inner race 78 and a number of balls 76 situated therebetween. A worm 80 80 is provided that has cylindrical end portions 82, with each of the end portions being rotatably supported by the inner races 78 of the anti triction ball bearing assemblies 72. The worm 80 and the anti friction ball bearing assembly 72 as can best be seen in FIG. 6 are mounted in the elongate opening 34 defined between the first and second housing half pot tions and E . A torque receiving plug 18 projects outwardly from one end of the worm 80, which plug is of non circular transverse cross section. A torque receiving cavity 18 extends inwardly into an opposite end of the worm 80. The ball bearing assembly 72 as may best be seen in FIG. 6 are maintained in a fixed position within the first and second housing half portions E and E by a pair of longitu dinally spaced ring shaped retainers 88 that engage circular grooves 90 formed in the half housing portions. Two transversely aligned lugs 92 project outwardly from the half housing portions E and E as shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, with each lug having a semi circular groove 94 extending therethrough, with the grooves cooperating to provide a first cylindrical opening 96. The first opening 96 may be removably engaged by the stabilizing rod B as shown in FIG. 1.The pair of lugs 92 also have transversely and axially aligned second openings 98 therein, which openings may be engaged by a chain or the like not shown to hold the torque multiplier assembly A in a. substantially stationary position during the time that it is being used to supply torque through the plug 60 or recess 62 shown inFIG. 7. In FiG. 4 the plug 50 is shown in removable engagement with a conventional socket wrench 100, which wrench 100 is in turn in engagement with a nut or bolt head 102 to which it is desired to impart a high torque either in loosening or rotating the scale. The elongate torque wrench B has a longitudinally extending first numbcred scale 14 thereon over which the rotatable portion 12 moves as the latter is rotated, with the free edge portion 12a of the portion 12 when transversely aligned with a graduation of scale 14 indicating the maximum torque in foot pounds that can be delivered by the torque wrench B. The gradeations 14 have numbers 14a imprinted on the handle B that indicate the magnitude of the torque. The handle B preferably has a second longitudinal scale 15 thereon opposite the scale 14, with numbers 15a of the seocnd scale indicating te torqu output of the torque multiplier assembly A. Each number 15a is obtained by multiplying the number 14a opposite thereof by the factor previously described. Once the actor has en determined it may be used to obtain all of the torque output numbers on the second scale 15, for the friction between the gears and bearing assemblies will not vary appreciably over the entire range of the low torque input. to the multiplier assembly A. The torque wrench B may be used individually over the entire low torque range thereof in a conventional manner. When a higher torque is required the tprque multiplier assembly A is placed in direct engagement with a socket wrench as shown in FIG. 4 to apply a desired high torque to a nut or bolt head 102. The torque multiplier assembly A is held in a non rotatable position relative to the nut or bolt head 102 by use of the stabilizer rod D, or a chain or restraining element not shown that extends through openings 98 and is secured to a suitable anchor.The torque wrcnch B is now placed in operative engagement with the multiplier assembly A, and the wrench portion.12 rotated for it to move longitudinally on the handle 10 until the free edge 12a thereof is transversely aligned with the graduation 15 that indicates the maximum torque output that will be exerted by the plug 60 or recess 62 when the torque wrench is exerting the maximum torque input 14a for which it is set. The torque wrench B exerts torque on torque multiplier assembly A by being pivoted upwardly and downwardly relative thereto as shown in FIG. 4. The.torque multiplier assembly A is illustrated as having a projecting torque receiving member 18 of non circular transverse cross section on o e end of worm 80 and a torque receiving recess 18 on the opposite end thereof, each of which may receive input torque from the torque input member 16 of head C of torque wrench . The direction of rotation of torque output plug 60 is controlled by changing the direction in which torque is imparted to worm 80 by torque wrench B. From the prior description of torque multiplier assembly A it will be apparent that lubricant ray be disposed within the housing portions E and E , and retained therein by the oil seals 64. The use and operation of the torque multiplier assembly A has been previously described in detail and neea not be repeated.
