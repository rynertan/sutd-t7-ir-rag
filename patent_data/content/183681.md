# METHOD OF COMPACTING CONCRETE

## Abstract
This publication describes a method for compacting a concrete mix 1 in a casting mold 2...8 into which the concrete mix 1 is poured between at least two adjacent and at least approximately parallel mold walls 2, 3, 4 . In accordance with the invention, the adjacent mold walls 2, 3 3, 4 are moved in a push pull manner and essentially on the plane of the walls so that the concrete mix 1 is subjected by the frictional action from the mold walls 2,3,4 to an internal compacting shear. The method in accordance with the invention facilitates the fabrication of thinner constructions than previously and improving the compactness of concrete surfaces.
