# Microcapsules for pressure sensitive recording.

## Abstract
Pressure sensitive recording papers cannot be pre pared by using a fast drying organic solvent as a dispersion medium for microcapsules containing a colourformer solu tion because conventional microcapsules do not possess satisfactory resistance to the solvent. This problem is over come by microcapsule having walls prepared by polycon densing a water soluble cationic urea resin and at least one prepolymer selected from melamine formaldehyde, urea formaldehyde and melamine urea formaldehyde prepoly mers on the surface of dispersed droplets of a colour former solution in the presence of an anionic surfactant. Complex coacervation occurs between the water soluble cationic urea resin and the anionic surfactant during poly condensation. The microcapsules find use in pressure sen sitive recording.
