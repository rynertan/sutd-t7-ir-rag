# Method for controlling angular position and apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for controlling the angular position of a motor by controlling the revolution of the motor in response to a given positioning command value ϑ₀ commanding a predetermined angular position of the motor shaft so as to stop the motor shaft at the predetermined angular position, wherein the acceleration α₁ or α₁ of the motor being accelerated in the initial acceleration stage of the motor position control operation is calculated, and, on the basis of the calculated acceleration and a commanded maximum velocity ω₁ , the remainder angular distance ϑ
