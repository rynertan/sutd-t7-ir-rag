# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR HANDLING SOLID MEMBERS HAVING SPACED APART PIN LIKE PROJECTIONS AND ASSEMBLIES OF SUCH MEMBERS

## Abstract
Electrical connectors 12 having pin conductors 18 are mounted on a flexible support sheet 14 by puncturing the pins through the sheet. Packaging is accomplished by folding the sheet 14 in a stack 80 and inserting the stack in a container 82 . The connectors 12 may be cut into smaller connectors while mounted on the sheet 14 . The connectors, while still mounted on the sheet 14 , may be dispensed to a work station where they may be plucked from the sheet, e.g. by a robot arm for assembly in an electrical appliance.
