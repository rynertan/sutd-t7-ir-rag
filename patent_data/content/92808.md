# Parallel analog to digital converter circuit.

## Abstract
A parallel analog to digital converter circuit comprises a plurality of level comparator circuits 10 and a plurality of detector means 52 . The level comparator circuits 10 compare the level of one analog input signal with a plurality of reference levels. Any two or more level comparator circuits 10 which receive consecutive reference levels from one set. Each of the detector means 52 determines whether or not the output signals trom the level comparator circuits 10 of one set are in a specified state. According to the number of sets of level comparator circuits 10 whose output signals are detected to be in the specified state, it is determined whether or not the analog to digital converter circuit functions correctly. The upper limit of the speed of analog to digital conversion can be determined according to this number of sets.
