## Description
A TEMPERATURE CONTROL SYSTEM FOR USE WITH TEMPERATURE RESPONSIVE DEVICE CALIBRATION ARRANGEMENT OR THE LIKE The present invention relates generally to an arrangement for precisely controlling temperatures and more more specifically to an arrangement for controlling very low and or cryogenic temperatures. In prior art arrangements it has been difficult and time consuming to calibrate resistance thermometers for cryogenic engineering use. Usually this type of calibration has been carried unit by unit and at usually at only one temperature. This of course does not lend itself to mass production of precision instruments such as cryogenic resistance thermometers which find notably application. in so called super conductor engineering. The present invention features the use of a computer controlled feed back temperature control system which enables the temperature of a suitable coolant to be maintained at exactly a desired temperature for storing precious organic tissues or the like. The arrangement further allows for a series of temperatures to be stagewisely attained and maintained for a period sufficiently long for the calibration of a number of cryogenic resistance thermometers for example . The features and advantages of the arrangement of the present invention will become more clearly appreciated from the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a first embodiment of the present invention Fig. 2 is a block diagram showing a second embodiment of the present invention and Fig. 3 is a schematic sectional view of cell utilized in the arrangements shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Turning now to the drawings and more specifically toFig. 1, a first embodiment of the present invention is shown. In this arrangement a cell indicated in the drawing by the numeral 1, has a temperature sensing element 2 and a heating element 3 immersed in a suitable coolant such as freon or alcohol. Indicated in this drawing by the numeral 5 is a thermocouple and located thereabout or immediately adjacent thereto is a sample container 4 in which precious organic tissue or the like is stored. A computer 6 which includes a CPU, a RAM and a ROM is operatively connected to an analog temperature regulator unit 10 via a voltage generator 9. Operatively connected to the analog temperature regulator 10 is a thyrister 11 which as shown, receives an input from the temperature sensing element 2. Interposed between the computer 6 and the thermocouple 5 is a digital voltmeter 12 which like the voltage generator 9 is connected to the computer through a GP IB type interface 13, 13 . The computer is provided with a CRT cathode ray tube 15 and a line printer 14. Fig. 3 shows an example of a cell which may be utilized in the arrangement shown in Fig. 1. In this figure the cell is denoted by the numeral 23. As shown the cell consist of an outer container 24 containing liquid nitrogen or other suitable cryogenic fluid .Immersed in this is a vessel having dual walls 25, 26 which contains a suitable coolant such as freon or alcohol and which is partially insulated from the cryogenic fluid by a helium gas layer defined between the walls 25 and 26. A suitable mixer 42 driven by a motor 43 is provided to mix the coolant and maintain an essentially uniform temperature throughout the coolant. In operation, the computer is adapted to issue an intial command to the voltage generator which in turns produces a voltage for example 3 volt adequate to induce the heater to raise the temperature of the fluid to a predetermined level, for example 100 degrees C.However, the precision of the feedback control provided by the temperature sensing element and the thyrister is only adequate to maintain the temperature within Q e 6 degrees of the target value. Thus, in order to acheXve exactly the desired temperature the computer calculates the voltage increase or decrease necessary on the basis of the input from the digital voltmeter 12, which of course is constantly responding to the output of the termocouple 5. Thus, the voltage generator may be subsequently commanded to increase the voltage level from 3.0 volt to 3.012 volt by way of example only. In this embodiment it is preferred that the computer take the form of a microcomputer for the sake of economy.Now, as well known such microcomputers are not able to carry out time sharing as compared with larger more sophisicated units, accordingly, a kind of ON OFF operation occurs between determining the actual temperature of the coolant via the thermocouple and the digital voltmeter, the subsequent calculation and the correction of the voltage being generated by the voltage generator. However, the computer is able perform this operation with sufficient speed to accurately maintain the tempeature of the coolant in the cell at exactly the desired level. This of course enables the safe storage of highly sensitive tissues or the like without the fear of deterioration due to excessive insufficient cooling thereof. Fig. 2 shows a second embodiment of the present invention. This arrangement is similar to that shown inFig. 1 but wherein a plurality of resistance thermometers 34, 34 , etc are immersed in a coolant contained in a cell indicated in this figure by the numeral 23. In this embodiment, the thermocouple 5 is replace with a standardized resistance thermometer element 31. This element 31 is connected by a line 33 to a current generator 27. For the purpose of correcting for any variations in the output of the current generator 27 a standard resistance 32 is connected in series with the standardized resistance thermometer element 31 which may be made of platinum . The current generator 27 in this instance is set to output 1 mA.A second current generator 28 is connected in series with the afore mentioned resistance theremometer elements 34, 34 etc.This second current generator is adapted to output 5 mA.Provided in this series circuit is a second standard resistance 35. A scanner 30 is operatively connected to each of the elements 31, 32, 35, 34, 34 etc., for sensing the terminal voltage thereof. A digital voltmeter 29 is connected to the scanner 30 as shown.Each of the current generators 27, 28 the scanner 30 and the digital voltmeter 29 are integrated with the computer through GP IB interfaces. As previt usly mentioned the standard reitance 32 is provided in series with the standardized resistance thermometer cement 31 for the purpose of eliminating the error which is apt to occur due to the inability of commercially available current generators to hold the current perfectly stable. Likewise the standard resistance 35 is provided in connection with the current generator 28. However, yet another source of error is encountered in that the metal used in the actual contacts via which the terminal voltages of the resistance thermometer elements to the calibrated are sensed, and the metal of the actual elements 34, 34 etc. tends to create a thermocouple effect and induce an EMF. To eliminate this error it is highly preferred in this embodiment to during the calibration operation to take a first reading via the scanner , reverse the polarity of the current flow generated by the current generator 28 and take a second reading. It is further preferred that the computer be programmed to take the two readings and average same. In operation the temperature of the coolant is raised to 10 degrees C for example, stablized at exactly that temperature via a feed back control type operation previously disclosed in connection with the first embodiment, and two terminal voltage readings taken as previously described. Tne data so derived is etw3 b0 the computer and duly processed therein. lex the temperature is lowered to exactly 20 degrees C and the calibration proceedure repeated. Subseqently, the temperture is dropped by 10 degree increments to 180 degrees C for example and each time highly accurate calibration data derived and stored. Consequently, it is possible to very accurately and quickly calibrate a large number of such type thermometers.
