# Sponge mop.

## Abstract
A sponge mop with wing sections which rotate together to fold a sponge against itself and apply pressure to expel water from the sponge. Slidable movement of a pressure applying member against the wing sections causes them to rotate together. After pressure is released, the wing sections return to a horizontal position with the sponge ready for mop ping.
