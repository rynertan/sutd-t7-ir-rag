# Process for determining the presence in a liquid of theophylline.

## Abstract
The presence of theophylline in a liquid, such as a body fluid, can be determined, quantitatively or qualitatively, by a colour reaction. The theophylline is converted to theophyllidine by reaction with an alkali such as sodium or potassium hydroxide at an elevated temperature and, after neutralization of the alkali with an organic acid, the theophyllidine formed is coupled with a chromogen to yield a colour whose depth is proportional to the theophylline concentration in the body fluid being tested. Hitherto the requirement for an elevated temperature has required the use of external heat in the invention there is used a solid alkali which generates heat of solution for the heating step there may also be used a non corrosive acid for the neutralization. A tetrazo chromogen yields a bright, relatively stable purple colour. The test can be carried out on, for instance, blood or saliva samples in a simple and effective manner.
