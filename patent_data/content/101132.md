# Fan for rotary cleaning mechanism in combine harvesters.

## Abstract
A rotary cleaning mechanism 20 for cleaning threshed grain in a combine harvester is disclosed wherein a fan 40 is mounted forwardly of the cleaning cylinder 50 to blow air through the cleaning sieves 67, 68 to make unwanted residue airborne for discharge from the cleaning cylinder 50 . A fan housing 42 is provided with a first passageway 44 to direct a flow of air through the grain being conveyed from a centrally located infeed mechanism 30 onto a radially outwardly spaced grain pan 65 . A second passage way 46 is also provided in the fan housing 42 to direct a flow of air through threshed grain being conveyed rearward ly off the grain pan 65 onto a radially outwardly located cleaning sieve 67 . The fan 40 is mounted on an axis of rotation 25 common with the cleaning cylinder 50 and forwardly of the infeed housing 35 , which includes an eliptically shaped infeed chute 34 to aerodynamically permit the flow of air therearound to clean threshed grain on the cleaning cylinder 50 immediately adjacent thereto. Deflector plates 48 are provided within the second passage way 46 to distribute the flow of air along the axial length of the cleaning cylinder 50 , with a more concentrated flow of air being directed at the forward end thereof.
