## Description
METHOD OF REDUCING AEROSOLIZATION OF liASTEWATER Technical Field The present invention relates to the treatment of wastewater which contains human waste, so as to reduce the aerosolization which can occur when said wastewater is subjected to turbulence, as for example, in the flushing of toilets or in secondary sewage treatment facilities. This is accomplished by incorporating into the wastewater from about 1 ppm to about 30 ppm of a water soluble poly ethylene oxide polymer having a molecular weight of about 100,000 to about 7,000,000. Background Art The agitation of aqueous systems which contain mios produces aerosol particles which contain the ti crobes. Aerosol particles, as commonly designated, include the true aerosol particles of from a few millimicrons to about 1 micron in diameter, and larger particles which can have diameters of more than 100 microns. See Encyclopaedia Britainnica, Micropaedia, Vol. I, page 114, 15thEd., 1975 These aerosol particles, are forcefully ejected from the aqueous system by agitation and can be subsequently carried by air currents, whereupon they can enter the human body through respiration or through hand to mouth contact with surfaces upon which the particles eventually settle.Baylor et al., Science, 198, pp. 575 580, November 1977 report that virus is transferred from sea water into the surrounding air by aerosolization from the surf, and that the concentration of virus in the aerosol is greater than in the main body of sea water. They indicate that this has public health implications in regions where sewage is dumped into coastal waters. Gerba et al. in Applied Microbiology 30,2 pp. 229 237 1975 describe a study in which it was found that bacteria and virus seeded into toilet bowls appeared in aerosol droplets produced by the toilet during flus i ,i 3w that these droplets remained airborne long enough to settle on surfaces throughout the bathroom. From the foregoing it is apparent that a reduction in aerosolization from wastewater containing human waste is desirable as a means of reducing the potential for disease transmission from said wastewater. It is an object of the present invention to reduce the potential for disease transmission from wastewater by incorporating into said wastewater a material which reduces the tendency of the wastewater to form aerosol particles when subjected to turbulence. It is a further object of the invention to reduce the potential for disease transmission from flushing toilets by dispensing into the flush water an agent which reduces aerosolization It is a further object of the invention to reduce the potential for disease transmission from aerated or agitated sewage treatment processes by incorporating an agent which reduces aerosolization into the wastewater which is treated by such processes. The attainment of these and other objects will be apparent from the following description. Disclosure of Invention In accordance with the present invention, the incorporation of levels of from about 1 ppm to about 30 ppm preferably from about 3 to about 15 ppm of high molecular weight, water soluble poly ethylene oxide resins into wastewater significantly reduces the tendency of the wastewater to aerosolize when subjected to turbulence, as in the flushing of toilets or in the agitation or aeration of sewage in a sewage treatment facility. The aerosol reduction agents utilized in the practice of the present invention are water soluble pcly ethylene oxide resins having molecular weights of from about 100,000 to about 7,000,000. The preferred molecular weight range is from about 1,000,000 to about 7,000,000. These polymeric resins are commercially available under the R trade name Polyox from Union Carbide Corporation. They can be prepared by the polymerization of ethylene oxide, utilizing an alkaline earth metal oxide as catalyst. Technical Service Bulletin LF 42518 published byUnion Carbide Corporation in 1973 indicates that the Polyox resins, when incorporated into aqueous grinding and cutting fluids at levels of 50 100 ppm, are effective in reducing mists i.e., aerosolization from these aqueous systems.Bulletin F 43273 published by Union Carbide Corporation in 1971 discloses the use of 10 30 ppm Polyox resin in water passing through conduits such as storm sewers and fire hoses in order to reduce hydrodynamic drag and thereby increase the rate of flow through the conduit. It does not appear that the prior art has heretofore recognized that levels of hzgh mo1e ul2r weight, watcr soluble poly ethylene oxide resins as low as 1 30 ppm are effective in reducing aerosolization of aqueous systems such as wastewater. The term wastewater as used herein means water which contains human body waste, i.e., fecal matter or urine. The present invention in its broadest aspect comprises a method for reducing aerosolization of wastewater which is subjected to turbulence, said method comprising the step of incorporating into said wastewater from about 1 ppm to about 30 ppm preferably from about 3 ppm to about 15 ppm of a water soluble poly ethylene oxide resin having a molecular weight of from about 100,000 to about 7,000,000, preferably from about 1,000,000 to about 7,000,000, and most preferably from about 1,000,000 to about 5,000,000. The poly ethylene oxide resin can be incorporated into the water prior to the introduction of the human waste or afterwards. The important point is that the resin be present with the waste in the wastewater prior to the tima the wastewater is subjected to turbulence. The present invention not only reduces the formation of aerosol particles having diameters of up to about 100 microns, as described hereinabove it also reduces the formation of larger size particles such as jet droplets which have diameters of up to about 1500 microns, and even splashes. For convenience in describing the present inventon, the term aerosolization is used in a general sense to refer to the formation and expulsion into the air of particles caused by the agitation of wastewater, regardless cf the size of the particles. The invention can be used in treating in Adli toilets to prevent aerosolization during flushing and it can also be utilized in secondary sewage treatment facilities to prevent aerosolization caused by turbulent movement of the sewage, as for example, during aeration or agitation. In treating individual toilets an appropriate amount of the poly ethylene oxide resin can be dispensed directly into the stream of water entering the bowl. In toilets of the usual household type which comprise a flush tank and a bowl, an appropriate amount of the resin can be dissolved in the entire contents of the tank water between flushes. In whatever way the resin is dispensed to the toilet, it is important that the water remaining in the bowl after the flush contain 1 30 ppm of the resin. This insures that the wastewater which is in the bowl at the beginning of the next succeeding flush will contain sufficient resin to suppress aerosolization.This can be accomplished by having the require amount of resIn present in all or sus stantially all of the water which is used to flush the toilet for example, in a tank type toilet, the required amount of resin can be dissolved in the tank water between flushes or, alternatively, it can be accomplished by directly dispensing a sufficient amount of resin to the bowl during the flush or at the end of the flush so as to produce 1 30 ppm of resin in the bowl after the flush cycle is completed. In a typical household toilet equipped with a flush tank, the water in the tank flows into the bowl through a flapper valve during the flush cycle. While water is flowing out of the tank new water is entering the tank from the household water supply and some of this new water will flow through the flapper valve into the bowl before we flapper valve closes. Also some new water will flow dir ectly into the bowl through the standpipe during the fius cycle. If, in practicing the present invention, the poly ethylene oxide resin is dispensed into the bowl by dissolving it in the water in the flush tank between flushes, it is apparent that because of the new water which is introduced during the next flush, the concentration in the tank should be higher than the target concentration for the bowl.The bowl water subsequent to each flush is comprised of from 10 to 65 original tank water, the remainder being new water. Accordingly, the concentration of resin in the tank water should be from about 1.5 to 10 times the concen tration desired in the bowl, depending upon the model and operating conditions of tank type toilet used. Alternatively, the resin can be dispensed late in the flush cycle to attain more efficient dispensing of the resin, i.e., less of the newly added resin will be flushed from the bowl during the time it is being added to the bowl and there will be less dilution by incoming water. In the treatment of toilets, the polyfethylene oxide resins of the present invention can be used in conjunction with other agents which are conventionally used to treat the toilet. Such agents include, for example, dyes, perfumes, sanitizers such as sodium hypochlorite and cetyl pyridinium chloride, surfactants such as the alkali metal and ammonium salts of C12 to C18 alkyl sulfates, alkyl sulfonates and alkylbenzene sulfonates and the reaction products of 10 to 30 moles of ethylene oxide with a hydrophobic base such as a C10 to C20 alcohol or a C6 to C12 alkyl phenol, and detergency builder salts such as alkali metal phosphates, pyrophosphates, carbonates and silicates. In sewage treatment plants wastewater is first subjected to a primary treatment which involves settling of solids. The wastewater is then put through a secondary treatment to remove finely divided or dissolved organics.In the secondary treatment a biologically active floc or slime is utilized in an aerobic process to convert the soluble organics into insoluble biomass through sorption and metabolism by the microbial population in the floc or slime. Two basic processes are used in secondary treatment. These are a The trickling filter process, which involves spraying the wastewater, via a rotating arm, over a substrate which is rich in biological film to remove the soluble organics. b The activated sludge process, which involves aeration of a biological floc to remove soluble organics by precipitation with the floc. Both of these secondary treatment processes, as well as a variety of similar aerated or agitated secondary treatment systems, involve subjecting the wastewater to turbulence, and thereby produce aerosolization. The aerosol which is produced is rich in microbes, including bacterial and viral pathogens which have not been subject to either removal or kill in the primary treatment. In the practice of the present invention the polytethylene oxide resin is introduced e.g., by a metering device into the wastewater upstream of the secondary treatment unit so as to obtain a level of 1 to 30 ppm of resin in the wastewater. The water soluble poly ethylene oxide resins of the present invention are sold commercially in the form of grsn1llar powders which are freely soluble in water. In the practice of the present invention the granular resin can be added directly to the wastewater or to water which will subsequently contain waste, however, in order to provide ease of handling and metering and to facilitate the rapid attainment of uniform concentration in the wastewater, it is preferred that the resin be predissolved in water or predispersed in an inorganic salt solution or in an organic solvent, before additìon to the wastewater.High shear mixing should be avoided in dissolving or dispersing the resin, since this can result in degradation of the polymer molecule See Union Carbide Corporation Bulletin F 42933 How to Dissolve POLYOX Water Soluble Resin, published inMay 1970, and incorporated by reference herein . The invention will be illustrated by the following examples EXAMPLE I This experiment illustrates the effectiveness of a representative poly ethylene oxide resin of the invention In suppressing the formation of microbe containing aerosols during toilet flushing. The experiment is conducted with an AmericanStandard Cadet Toilet which is fitted with a hollow cubical chamber which has base dimensions of 67.3 cm x 62.2 cm, and is 52.7 cm in height all dimensions are interior . The chamber is made of clear plexiglass and has an opening in its bottom wall base which is of the same size and shape as the rim of the toilet bowl. This chamber rests on top of the toilet bowl, thereby providing an enclosed volume of aim above the bowl in which aerosol particles from the bowl can be trapped. Prior to flushing, the water in the bowl is innoculated with MS 2 bacteriophage, a virus which destroysE. Coli bacteria. Clean petri dishes are placed on the interior bottom surface of the chamber i.e., the surface wrch surrounds, and is parallel to, the rim of the toilet bowl . when the toilet s shed, aerosol particles con hiing the rheMS 2 bacteriophage, rise into the chamber and settle on the petri dishes. Each petri dish is then overlaid with a soft agar medium containing E. Coli, and the culture is incubated to form a lawn of E. Coli cells on the dish. At each point where an MS 2 phage has landed on the p tri dish, there remains a small visible void in the lawn of E. Coli which is formed, due to destruction of E. Coli by the 5 2 phage. These voids are counted, and their number provides a measure of the amount of aerosolization which occurred during the flush. The procedure used for preparing MS 2 bacteriophage was substantially the same as described at Pages 3 to 9 of Experiments in MicrobiologicalGenetics, Clowes and Hayes John Wiley Sons, Inc., NewYork 1968 , incorporated by reference herein. Details of the aerosolization test procedure are as follows 1. Tryptacase Soy Salt broth is innoculated withE. Coli about three hours prior to the experiment and is incubated with agitation at 370C. 2. Thirty three 5 ml. Trypticase Soy Salt soft agar tubes are melted and held in a water bath at 470C. 3. Thirty three 90 mm. x 90 mm. square petri dishes are labeled, and if necessary, placed in an inverted position in a 370C incubator to insure that the plates are free of condensation water. 4. The toilet bowl is cleaned with CloroxR a product of The Clorox Company . This is done by pouring onehalf cup about 119 ml. of Clorox into the bowl, brushing the entire interior of the bowl, waiting 10 minutes, and then flushing the toilet. The toilet is Then flushed an additional five times. 5. 15 ml. of 0.5 sodium thiosulfate is added to the flush tank, and the toilet is flushed. This procedure is repeated four times in order to ensure that all chlorine has been removed from the system. If an aerosol suppression agent is to be used in the experiment, it is added in the apprcpr ate amount to tiie tank during each of these four flushes in order to ensure distribution throughout the system. The appropriate amount of aerosol suppression agent is added as the flush is initiated to simulate automatic dispensing. After the fourth flush, 15 ml. of 0.5 thiosulfate is again added to the tank. 6. The interior surfaces of the chamber are cleaned with a 0.47 solution of Wescodyne , an iodinebased hard surface disinfectant marketed by West ChemicalProducts Co. The 33 petri dishes from 3, above are placed side by side on the interior bottom surface of the chamber, and the chamber, without its top in place, is mounted on the toilet bowl. 7. From an MS 2 lysate having a titer of about 1011 plaque forming units per ml., the bowl is innoculated to S achieve a level of approximately 108 plaque forming units of bacteriophage per ml. of bowl water. 50 grams of human feces which has been sterilized by autoclaving are also added to the bowl. 8. The top is then placed on the chamber. 9. The toilet is flushed, and thirty minutes are allowed to elapse to provide time for the aerosol particles to settle on the petri dishes. When aerosol suppression agent is to be tested, the appropriate amount is added as the flush is initiated to simulate automatic dispensing. 10. The chamber is disassembled and covers are placed on the. petri dishes. 11. 0.5 ml. of E. Coli broth culture is added to each molten Trypticase Soy Salt soft agar tube from 2, above , the tops are removed from the petri dishes from 10, above and each petri dish is overlaid with the contents of a single soft agar tube. 12. The soft agar is allowed to solidify, the petri dishes are inverted, and they are incubated at 370C overnight approximately 12 18 hours . 13. After the incubation period, the total number of void spots plaques on the petri dishes are counted and recorded. Using the foregoing experimental technique, tests were run to evaluate the ability of a representative poly ethylene oxide of the present invention to suppress the formation of aerosol from the toilet. The material used wasPolyox C, a poly ethylene oxide having a mean molecular weight of 4 6 million, marketed by Union Carbide Corporation.The Polyox C was added to the system as indicated in Steps 5 and 9 above by dispensing 0.080 grams of the material as a saturated NaCl suspension in the flush tank during each flush.This produces a concentration of about 3 5 ppm Polyox C in the bowl. The Polyox C concentration actually produced in the bowl was determined by analysis of the bowl water after the flush in Step 9. The test was replicated three times.A control, in which no Polyox C was added to the system was also replicated three times. The results are shown in TableI.

EXAMPLE II This example illustrates the use of the present invention in the secondary treatment of sewage. The secondary treatment unit is of the trickling filter type. In this type of unit, wastewater effluent obtained from the primary treatment sedimentation unit is distributed over a contact bed in the form of droplets, thin sheets or spreading jets from fixed or rotating spray nozzles which are positioned about 3 inches above the bed, on revolving arms. The bed comprises broken stone or other contact material which is covered with biological growths. As the wastewater flows from the primary treatment unit, and prior to the time it is fed to the spray nozzles in the secondary treatment unit, a poly ethylene oxide resin having a molecular weight of 5 million is metered into the wastewater. The resin is in the form of a dispersion consisting of 10 by weight of resin in a saturated aqueous NaCl solution. The dispcrsion is mitered into the waste water at a rate so as to provide a concentration of about 5 ppm resin. Use of the present invention as described in this example results in a significant reduction in aerosolization in the secondary treatment unit compared to the situation where the poly ethylene oxide resin is not added to the wastewater.
