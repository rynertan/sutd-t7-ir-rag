# Trimming resistances in symmetrical polyphase networks.

## Abstract
A symmetrical polyphase network consists of a ring of series connected alternate resistors R1 to R4 and capacitors C1 to C4 , with junction points therebetween alternately forming inputs 1 to 4 and outputs 5 to 8 of the network. For example there are four resistors and four capacitors. The resis tors are trimmed so that the product of the resistance and the capacitance of the components connected to each respective output is equal to a product RC, R and C being the nominal re sistance and capacitance of the resistors and capacitors.
