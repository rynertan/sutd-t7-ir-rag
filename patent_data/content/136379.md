## Description
Associative Memory Circuit System and Method Technical Field My invention is an electronic associative memory circuit that includes a word comparator device for providing numeric measurement of the degree of word similarity between the compared words. In operation the comparator device is connectable in a computer storage loop to locate and extract records that are similar to the supplied query. Inexact queries can locate records.Background Art An associative memory is a special kind of storage device. whereas most memories are numerically addressed, associative memories are dressy via their contents. For example, one might ask an associative memory to return all records containing the letters ZXU in columns one, two and tree respectively. The address applied to an associative memory is the query.If some record exactly satisfies the query, then the query is said to be exact, otherwise it is said to be inexact. Conventional associative memories provide no information in response to an inexact query. Inexact aueries are merely rejected. If a record exists within the associative memory that is only slightly different from the supplied query, then in many cases it would be desirable to know of its existence. Such records are minor corruptions of the query. Alternative ly, they are very similar to the query.Some related concepts were discussed in the following articles 1 The application of a pattern matching algorithm to searching medical record text, in the proceedings of the second annual symposium on computer applications in medical care, p. 308313, IEEE 78CH 1413 3, by the inventor et al, a copy of which is attached hereto and made a part whereof 2 The Ramon D.

A storage loop is formed when a storage device repeatedly and sequentially transmits its entire contents to external devices over a high speed data bus. An associative memory may be formed by attaching to this bus a device whose function it is to scrutinize in a passive manner the data stream originating from the storage device as it passes by on the bus. This attached device senses data appearing on the bus that is related in some predetermined fashion to a supplied query. Central to associative memories of this type is some sort of word comparator device. In the prior art, a simple digital comparator distinauishes two cases egual and unequal. Other devices can detect certain special corruptions such as the transposition of two characters, the depletion of a single character. Still other devices compare two words to arrive at an indication of how similar they are. This device recodes the words as binary strings and then measures the Hamming distance between them. Devices in the prior art do not, however, seem to compare words in a general way that approaches the sort of similarity recognizing ability found in humans.United StatesPatents 3,333,243 3,651,459 and 4,084,260 show the state of the prior art.Disclosure of Invention This invention relates to a new and improved word comparator device ref erred to hereinafter as a word associator circuit that provides a nimeric measurement of the degree of a word similarity between the compared words as defined b mathemati cal formula. This invention also relates to an associative retrieval system and method for retrieval of inexact queries in a quick and expeditious manner. The circuit may be an electrical digital circuit or other type of circuitry that will provide an output conforming to a mathematical formula to provide an improved word comparator function. An associative memory is normally thought of as a device which responds only to exact queries.Some may respond in a limited manner to inexact queries1 for example see Backend Processors is REM the Answer in Datamation, March 1978, pg. 206 207. The system and method of this invention vases the improved word comparator device to form an associative memory which responds to inexact queries in a new and useful way. This word comparator device is used to rapidly locate records most similar to a query. Similarity is defined by certain mathe medical formula and is measured using a high speed digital circuit referred to hereafter as a wordAssociator Circuit in the preferred embodiment. Similarity has three components word, numeric, and mask. Most central to this invention is the notion of word similarity. Words are strings of symbols from some alphabet and word similarity is a measurement of the similarity between two words. Several variable parameters are involved in the definition of word similarity, making it very flexible. Of significance is the ease with which the degree of word similarity may be determined using digital circuits. Using existing technology word associator circuits may be built to process serial data at rates in excess of 20,000,000 characters per second. Such a circuit is described hereinbelow. The system includes the use of one or more associator circuits in storage loops to locate and extract records most similar to the supplied query. The system s architecture is preferably totally parallel so tat it may be configured to process any number of simultaneous requests. Its memory is partitioned into storage loops so that through suitable configuration, arbitrarily large data sets map be processed. attached to each storage loop via a dyramically variable network are multiple associator circuits to locate and extract the records most similar to the supplied query.By varying the number of storage loops versus the number of associator circuits, configurations may achieve a wide range of cost response time possibilities. In use, the associative retrieval system with associator circuits could off load from a host processor, the task of searching for database records. In doing this, it could provide improved services as well as entirely new services. The method for retrieval as described in detail herein that conforms to a mathematical formula also provides a new and improved invention over and above the prior art. Wnen queries of words are made seeking records, exact records as well as slightly different records or similar records, are produced as an output. Such outputs are said to be a minor corruptions of the query or are said to be in close similarity with the query. A measurement of the degree of similarity between two stings of symbols from some alphabet is defined in The definition, computation and application of symbol string similarity functions , Emory University, M.S. Thesis, Department of M.athen,atics, 1978, by the inventor, z copy of which is attached hereto and made a part hereof. This measurement agrees well with intuition while remaining mathematically simple and easy to compute, see The application of a pattern matching a2gorithm1o searching medical record text , in the proceedings of the second annual symposium on computer applications in medical care, p. 308 313, IEEE, 78 CH 1413 4, by the inventor et al, a copy of which is attached hereto and made a part hereof. Using this measurement, minor corruptions may be located, thus extending the conventional function of an associative memory into the area of a similarity memory.Of significance is the fact that this measurement may be trivially computed using the new and improved digital circuitry disclosed herein. Circuits to commute it are described herein and may be built to achieve very high processing rates. Therefore, in some applications, minor corruptions may be located without additional overhead. The basic mathematics of word similarity was developed by the inventor and constituted his Master s thesis at Emory University, Atlanta,Georgia, June, 1978 referred to herein above. The inventor is also primary author of a paper presented to any published by the IEEE reference herein above.This paper describes the application of word similarity to searching raw narrative medical record text. It is an object of this invention to provide an associative memory circuit that is a new and improved word associator circuit. It is another object of this invention to provide a word associator circuit that provides a measurement of the degree of word similarity. It is another object of this invention to provide a word associator circuit that provides a numeric m22surement of the degree of word similar ity between the compared words as defined by a mathematical formula. It is arJot ler object of this invention to provide a word associator circuit in the for of an electrical circuit for providing a word com parison conforming to the mathematical formula. It is another object of this invention to provide an associative retrieval system by connecting at least one word associator circuit into at least one storage loop by dynamically variable networks. A further object of this invention is to provide a method of processing data for word comparison that conforms to a particular mathe matical formula.

The associative memory circuit includes a word associa tor circuit shown in detail as an electrical digital circuit in Figures 6 through 12. The system or associative memory circuit is shown in Figure 1.This associative memory circuit is an improved associative retrieval device that includes the use of the word associator or comparator circuit connected in a storage loop to locate and extract records that are most similar to the supplied query. Inexact queries will rapidly locate records similar with respect to word numeric and mask related measurements of similarity. The new and improved method that is set forth below in detail provides a method of word comparison and a method of processing in the improved associative memory circuit or associative retrieval device. The processing is preferably in a parallel configuration that provides rapid response to queries, while processing a large number of simultaneous requests. Referring now to Figure 1, most internal data traffic within the associative memory circuit 10 passes through shared memory 12, a time multiplexed multi port random access readwrite memory of any well known design. Each of the many ports of the shared memory 12 is allotted a brief time slice on the order of one millisecond.A port may disconnect prior to this time elapsing. The associative memory circuit 10 communicates with the outside world through its communications modules 14 and 14 of any a well nown design. A plurality of communications modules r2y be connected as illustrated by numeral 18 and the small circles or dots. The communication modules 14 and 14 are microcomputer based flexible interfaces responsible for decoding requests and then supervising the operations of the associative memory circuits 10 to satisfy the request. The communications modules or circuits may communicate with the other associative memory circuits 10 using shared memory through buses 16 and 16 in any well known manner and by use of any well known design. These communication modules might also perform considerable preprocessing before passing a query onto the other system components. The main storage units MSU 20 and 20 of any well known design are devices that contain the actual records to be searched in memory units of any well known design. The main storage units contain any of a variety of well known control circuits to transmit these records in a fixed format over a bus. A plurality of main storage units may be used as illustrated by number 22 and the dots. The transmission format requires the simultaneous transmission of record characters taken secuentially from the record moving from right to left and from left to right, see Figure 13 and the in use description set forth hereinbelow. Nunleric portions of a record are transmitted separately.The bus or lines 24 and 24 also contain control and timing signals, error correction codes and a data path of well known design for use in the communications between associator circuits 42, 44, 42 and 44 and extractor circuits 56 and 56 . Within an MSU 20 and 20 , data might be compressed to conserve resources by any well known means The main storage units SU 20 and 20 might be formed using virtually any of today s data storage devices. Following the transmission of each record along lines 24 and 24 , Q short blanking period is required to permit the associator circuits to initialize themselves for another record. Prior to the transmission of each records data, the MSU 20 and 20 must transmit an internal record number for the record that follows.These numbers should be assigned sequentially by the MSU 20 and 20 . The control circuit 30 is connected to the NSU devices 20 and 20 by bus 26. The control circuit 30 is responsible for all update and control of the M.SU s. The control circuit may consist of one or more simple microcomputers of well known design. Control circuit 30 communicates through shared memory 12 over bus 40.Optionally, a direct interface 32 of well known design might be attached by bus 34. This would permit a direct data path from an MSU 20 and 20 to an external high speed device. This would facilitate the rapid loading of an entire MSU 20 and 20 as might occur at bootstrap time. All data storage loops generated by theMSU devices 20 and 20 feed into network switching 36 by bus 24 and 24 . The network switching circuit 36 is responsibe for routing through bus 38 or 38 data from an MSU 20 and 20 to a vacant associator circuit 42 or 44 as well as 42 or 44 to satisfy a query. Additional associator circuits ma be connected between 42 and 44 and 42 and 44 as illustrated by numerals 46 and 46 and the dots. Additional parallel circuits may also be interconnected as illustrated by numeral 48 and the dots. Network switching circuit 36 is connected to a control device 50 of well known design by bus 52 which processes requests communicated through shared memory 12 by connection bus or line 54.Control device 50 decodes these requests and decides which requests are to be processed and in what order. Then control device 50 c√èmmunicates to network switching 36 over line 52, a specific order to reconfigure the network. The associator circuits ac 42, 44, 42 and 44 , are an important part of this invention.The associator circuits 42, 44, 42 and 44 are connected in strings terminated at one end by a single or multiple extractor circuits 56 and 56 respectively by continuations of bus 38 or 38 respectively and at the other end by the network switching module 36. Data from a selected MSU passes through network switching 36 and then through an associator circuit 42, 44, 42 and 44 .This circuit scruitnizes the data as it passes, looking for records that are very similar to the query provided. Of significance here is the fact tat the word associator circuits, a part of 42, 44, 42 , and 44 within each associator circuit can look for similar records at very high data rates. It is expected that data rates on the bus in excess of 20,000,000 characters per second are quite possible using today s standard technology.The associator circuits 42 , 44, 42 , and 44 flag the most similar records and they are then extracted from the data stream by the extractor circuits 56 and 56 and eventually passes back through shared memory 12 over bus 60 to the communications circuits lt and 14 . The diagnostic computer 64, also of any well known design, is connected in a well known manner to the associative memory 10 to provide system performance statistics and maintenance information in a well known manner. Referring now to Figure 2, the basic module is referred to by numeral 43 whicM is a more detailed block diagram of associator circuit 42 and 42 of Figure 1. Fach pair of associator circuits in Figure 1 is similar to the Figure 2 illustration. Figure 2 shows the associator circuit 43 along with the basic interconnections.The query is stored in query storage 70. As records pass by on the data bus 38, the records are received by the associator circuit on interface 72 over bus 74 where the records are merged with query characters transmitted over bus 76 in an appropriate manner and then forwarded through buses 78, 80, and 82 to the three types of associator circuitry. The three types of associator circuitry are 1 a word associator circuit 84, 2 a number associator circuit 86, and 3 a mask associator circuit 88. Within the word associator circuit 84 exists two circuits designated by numerals 100 and 100 , one of which is shown in greater detail in block diagram inFigure 4 which is illustrated in schematic form in Figures 6 through 12. The word associator circuit 84 combines the output of circuits 100 and 100 at the end of each record to arrive at the degree of word similarity. If the basic circuit of Figure 4 is used then at the end of each record, the X output from each copy of the circuit are added together by any well known means to arrive at the numerator of the fraction that equals the degree of word similarity. The denominator is computed by any well known means including table lockup by circuit 84 and is equal to L L 1 where L is the length of the compared words. If the more complex circuit ofFigure 5 is used, then the numerator is computed by any well known means and is equal to twice the sum of the M quantities output from the two copies of the circuit. The denominator is computed by any well known means and is equal to the sum of the TOTM quantities output from each copy of the circuit.The word associator circuit 84 may or may not actually perform a division to arrive at the degree of word similarity.Instead, the ranker 96 and the other associator circuits 80 and 88 might work entirely with fractional representations of similarity. Using the basic circuit of Figure 4 as 100 and 100 inFigure 2, computes the basic form of word similarity given by the mathematical formula disclosed herein.It should also be noted the Figure 5 is an enhanced version of the circuit in Figure 4. The word associator circuit is mainly made up of circuits 100 and 100 and interconnecting circuitry of well known design. Again, referring to Figure 2, at the end of each record, the three associators forward their opinion of how similar the record and the query were over bus 90, 92, and 94 respectively to a ranker 96 of well known design. If the record w as a perfect match, then it is marked by the ranker 96 for immediate extraction. Otherwise it is ranked relative to the prior records processed.Only the N highest ranking records are maintained in the ranker 96 by their internal record numbers.were, N is an integer design parameter of well known design. Loading of the many parameters involved in the association process is controlled by an onboard microprocessor or controller 98 of well known design. The microprocessor is connected to the basic module in a well know manner. When all records have been observed, the ranker waits for the highest ranking records to appear again in the storage loop. As they appear, the ranger 96 marks them for extraction in any well know manner. The basic method for computing the degree of word similarity in a non complex and expeditious manner involves processing symbols as they occur in a bidirectional serial data stream. By bicirectional serial, we mean tirat successive positions from each of the two words under com parison and from their flips are simultaneously transmitted. For example, imagine two observers of the data stream performing the procedure or method as illustrated in Figure 12. Of signifi cance is the fact that each observer needs knowledge only of the data instantaneously before him in the data stream.He describe the procedure from the standpoint oi these observers. We describe the information they must remember, com Dutations they must perform anc cecisions they must make. Each observer perform an identical method, the first observes the transmission of the words, the second observes the transmission of the flips of the words. before starting, each observer must perform certain initial tasks.After all data has passed, they combine their knowleoce to arrive t the degree of word similar it between the transmitted words. Bereafter, the block diagram show in Figure 4 will be described, second the method performed by each observer will be described and then the method in which their know edge is eventually combined will be described. Referring now to Figure 4, the one word associator circuit in block diagram form in illustrated as numeral 100. Two of these circuits 100 are included in the word associated circuit 84 inFigure 2. The data selector 102 illustrated inFigure 4 is shown in detail in Figure 6 and may utilize two quadruple bus gates such as Texas instruments, Incorporated s circuit 74125 and 74126, Exhibit A. It has two input buses 104 and 106 entering from above. One of these two in one time frame is routed to a single output 108 exiting below. Figure 6 discloses the schematic for a single bus line. Clock input potential e 110 is connected to the selector 102. Two clocks are utilized in circuit 100,Figure 4, They are ref erred to as f and end graphically illustrated in Figure 3 to disclose their interrelationship. Their interrelationship and purpose is described and disclosed in the diagrame illustrated in Figure 3. The purpose of 0 is to select either the read or write mode of operation in the tally memory 114 in Figure 4 and to provide certain triggers in latches 170 and 136 of Figure 4. When is low, the read mode of operation in 114 is selected. When g is high, the write mode of operation in 114 is selected.The event consisting of a low to high transition of may serve as a trigger to latch components 170 and 136 of Figure 4. The purpose of e is to define whether a query or a bus character is currently being processed. A complete cycle of corresponding to a re d write cycle in 114 occurs during each half cycle of e as shown in Figure 3. Another purpose of 6 is to provide a trigger to latch 182 ofFigure 4. The event consisting of a high to 1 low transition of g and may serve as a trigger to latch 182. The clock G is used as a control input in blocks 149,126 and 102 of Figure 4. The main portion of the Figure 4 circuit is designated by numeral 112 and includes a random access read write memory 114 referred to as tally or a tally memory. The memory address enters from above through bus 108. The read write mode of operation is selected by the read write potential entering from the right through line 116 from a clock means of well known design not shown. When read write potential is low, the read mode is selected. When read wzite potential is high, the write mode is selected.. Data exists from the lower left on bus 120 and enters from the upper right. In the preferred embodiment, tally is organized as 256 8 bit words. Thus, addresses and data are B bit quantities. Figure 7 shows the schematic for each bit of a tally word The tally may in clude one or more Texas Instrument Incorporated Hex inverter 122 No. 7404, Exhibit AA, and 256 bit read write memory 124, No. 74200, Exhibit B attached hereto and made a part hereof disclosing the cir cuits. It should be designed so that its contents may rapidly be set to zero by clear means 118. Simply setting all cells simultaneously to zero, may however not be practically feasible due to power sure and overheating considerations.Therefore, several cycles may be necessary to clear the memory. Each cycle would then clear a fixed portion of the memory. Also, it is not necessary to actually set all of the cells to zero. An extra bit associated with each word could be maintained. To clear the memory, only those extra bits would be cleared. Then when a memory word is read, this extra bit is tested.If it is zero, then zero is read out instead of the actual memory contents. This extra bit is set only when its associated location is written into. Now, if one is read out, then the actual memory contents are presented as usual to the outside world. In this way, the extra bits affect a logical clearing of the memory while avoiding a physical clearing of all of the cells.Techniques such as these serve to significantly expedite the clearing operation, but such pro cures are not necessary because there are well known standard procedures available. The add block Figure 4 is an incrementer decrementer 126. Data enters from the right.Depending on the state of input potential, the input potential value of the entering data is either incremented or decremented before exiting the two four bit binary full adders circuit 130 on bus 132, as shoum in Figure 8. The adders 130 may include 2 Texas Instrument Incorporated 4 bit binary full adder No. 7483, Exhibit C attached hereto and made a part hereof. Hex inverters 134 No. 7404, Exhibit AA is connected between the input potential over bus 128. The incrementer decrementer 326 in Figure 9 is actually an adder in which one of the sunaands is restricted to either plus or minus one. If input potential of 128 is zero, ten plus one is added.If input potential of 128 is one, then minus one is added. A positive edge triggered data latch 136 inFigure 4 is connected to bus 132 by bus 138. Data enters through bus extension 138 from the left and exits from the right on bus 140 to tally 114.On the positive going edge of read write potential actuated by input , the contents entering latch 136 are latched and become the output from the latch over bus 140. In the preferred embodir,ent shown in Figure 9, the latch is a two bit D type register 5 with 3 state output 142 shown in Figure 9, Texas Instrument Incorporated Number 74173 attached and made a part hereof as Exhibit D. A convertible sign tester 144 in Figure 4 has an input through bus 132 for data entering from the right and the tester 144 determines if this data is non positive or non negative, depending on the state of the input potential on bus 146 entering from below. The test is performed relative to two s complement arithmetic. If the input poten tial is low, then test will output high on output bus 148 to the left, provided that its input is greater than or equal to zero. In the preferred embodiment, tester 144 is shown in Figure 10 as an 8 bit device.The input 132 is connected to two dual 5 input positve no gate 150 and 152 Texas Instrument No. 74260 attached as Exhibit E connected to one gate of a quadruple 2 input positive and gate 154, Texas Instrument No. 7408 attached asExhibit EE. Gate 154 is connected to one gate of a quadruple 2 input positive or gates 156 TexasInstrument Incorporated No. 7432 attached asExhibit EEE. Gate 156 Texas Instrument No. 7432 is also connected to and gate 158. And gate 158Texas Instrument No. 7408 is connected to one of the input lines 132 and line 146 through inverter 160, a Texas Instrument No. 7404, Exhibit AA.The output of 156 is connected to the input of 162 that is the same as 156 having another input from and gate 164 with input from bus 146 and the output of inverter 168, a Texas Instrument Incorporated 7404 that is attached as Exhibit AA. The exhibits are incorporate herein and made a part hereof. A clearable edge triggered latch 170 is shown in Figure 4 and shown in detail in Figure 11 with an adder attached as described below. Input 172 inserts a one 1 into latch 170. The output is transmitted on bus 174 to add latch 182. The adder 170 has two inputs on busses 148 and 172 and a single output on bus 174 which is the sum of the inputs. The output 178 of the adders 176, such as a 4 bit binary full adder of TexasInstrument, Incorporation No. 7483 attached asExhibit C become the input to the latches 180 such as 4 bit D type registers with 3 state outputs,Exhibit D. One of the inputs to the adder is the output of the latch. The other input enters from above in Figure 11 and is wired permanently to be equal to 1.The latches 180 are sim,ilar to item 142 and are triggered from bus 148 when it is high at the positive going edge of the read write potential. The current 3 aitch contents exit from below over bus 174, to an add latch 182. In the preferred enbod inrent, latch 170 is an 8 bit latch coupled to an adder with an E bit output and two 7 bit inputs as shown in Figure 11. The clearing connections are not shown in Figure 11, but may be accomplished by any well known manner. Add latch 182, shown in Figures 4 and 12, is like item 170. Its input enters from bus 174 from above. Add latch 182 is triggered on the negative going edge of the read write potential 6 In the preferred embodiment, add latch 182 inclues 4 bit binary full adders 184 such as TeasInstruments Corporation No. 7483, is a 13 bit latch coupled, that is connected to a 4 bit D type register with 3 stage outputs 186 such as TexasInstrument Corporation No. 74173. Indicator readout devices of well known design may be connected thereto. The output of item 182 is an electrical output signal that may be translates to readable or other indications by any well known device. Clearing connections are not shown in Figure 12, but any well known devices or procedures may be used. Referring now to illustration Figure 13, the memory 190 contains the words ABC and ABB which are to be compared. They are transmitted via two transmitters 192 and 194 over a data stream four characters wide, as illustrated. The top half of the stream contains the transmission of the unaltered words and the bottom half contains the transmission of the flips of the words. On each side of the stream sits an observer 196 and 200.Each observer is watching a single column at a time as columns flow from left to right. The memory 190 and transmitters 192 and 194 correspond to the MSU 20 of Figure 1 and the data stream roughly for illustration purposes corresponds to the data bus 38 of Figure 2 although query characters do not occur on the data bus or in the MSU . The two observers correspond for illustration purposes to the two copies of the circuit 100 shown inFigure 4 contained within the word associator 84 of Figure 2. To perform his appointed task, each observer must remerber a numeric quantity associated with each alphabet member. In this example there are but three A, B, and C. This collection of quantities corresponds for illustration purposes to tally 114 of Figure 4.Each observer must also remember a numeric quantityR that is 170 and another M that is 182. These correspond for illustration purposes directly withFigure 4. At each instant in time, each observer notices two characters before him. He processes one at a time in some fixed order, say top to bottom. First, he increments the quantity corresponding to the top character. Then if it is less than or equal to zero, he increments R. Next, he decrements the quantity corresponding to the bottom character. Then if it is greater than or equal to zero, he increments R. Finally, nor that both characters are processed, he updates N by addingR to it. This continues for each column as they flow past. In the above, we have assumed that the observer started with all quantities equal to zero. Once the record has passed, the two observers add together the values for X, that they have arrived at. This result is then divided by L L 1 which in this case is 3 3 1 12. L is defined as the length of the compared words.Thus, we have 8 12 2 3 as the final similarity between the two words. Figure 13 displasy the final state of all numeric auantities involved. A basic mathematical formula has been created.If A is an alphabet, then words in A are finite concatenations of members from A. If w is a word in A, then w denotes the flip of w. For example, the flip of the word abcd is dcba . If x and y are numbers then x,y denotes the greater of the two quantities x y and 0. If w is word in A, then n a,v,i denotes the number of occurances of alphabet member a in word w found in position i or beyond where position is measured canonically from left to right. If w and v are words in A, both of length L, then the degree of word similarity between them is denoted S w,v and is given by the formula below EMI23.1 This formula, as set forth above and well understood by those skilled in the art, produces a number between 0 and 1 inclusive.It produces 1 if and only if w and v are identical. It produces 0 if and only if w and v share no common alphabet members. Intermediate values are interpreted as degrees of similarity between these two extremes.Formula exist and are discussed in The Definition,Computation and Application of Symbol StringSimilarity Functions referred hereinabove, which do not presume eguality of the lengths of w and v.The above formula is, however, the most fundamental.It equally weighs all alphabet members and word positions. It corresponds to the circuit ofFigure 4. In the equation above, the fundamental compu tation is that involving the double sumn,ation. Various forms of the equation might still perhaps produce a useful measurement of word similarity.For example, the whole equation might be raised to some positive integral power. Falk in the artical referred to hereinabove, discussed a function which also associated with each pair of words, a number between zero and one. But his function is consider ably more complex and in practice is much more difficult to compute. This is discussed in the thesis referred to hereinabove. The disclosed formula rests on a simpler and more rigorous mathematical foundation, as pointed out in the thesis. Faulk also makes little attempt towards justifying his formula. It should be noted that the circuit invention evolved from the formula to the algorithm to the circuit. The following criteria are met 1. X,athe.atical simplicity 2. Ease of computation 3. Agreement with human intuition 4. Flexibility to permit varied applications.The formula derived in the thesis and disclosed herein and made a part hereof is rathematically simple and produces results that appear to agree well with human intuition as referred to in theIEEE article referred to hereinabove. Computation of the formula in a straight forward fashion requires quite a bit of work, primarily due to the double summation. The next evolutionary step is the invention of an algorithm which quickly computes the formula. This algorithm is presented herein in the form of a Fortran function subprogram. It is called with three input parameters IQ, IR and N. IQ and IR each of which is a dimension N integer vector. Upon return, the variable Theta is the degree of similarity between the input words IQ and IR. Alphabet members are integers between 1 and 256 inclusive. To process a character from each of the two words under comparison, the algorithm implemented in machine language on a modern general purposeCPU such as the IBM 370, requires the execution of dozens of instructions each comprised of many micro instructions. To perform this same task, our circuit requires only two internal clock cycles. Each represents approximately a read write cycle pertaining to a high speed random access memory. Actually, the clock must be slightly slower than the memory s maximum speed to permit other circuit components tG operate. In use, however, the multiple should be less than 2. Therefore, we see that our circuit is capable of computing our definition of word similarity much faster than any existant general purpose processor. A complete similarity memory system may contain many such circuits. Therefore, the system would then be performing a search function beyond the capabilities of existant general CPU s. The basic algorithm as programed in Fortran is FUNCTION THETA IQ. IR, N CC IQ AND IR ARE EACH WORDS OF LENGTH N IN THEC ALPHABET CONSISTING OF THE NUMBERS 1 THROUGH 256.C THEY ARE PASSED AS INTEGER VECTORS EACH OFC DIMENSION N.

In Figure 5, it is assumed that the read mode is selected as the device is only written to during master initializtion. In the preferred embociment the read write memory 210 is organized as 127 2 bit words. SYN consists of three random access read write memories, 216, 216 , and 216 . In each, the address enters on bus 218 from above the data output transmitted on bus 220, 220 , and 220 from below. In the Figure, we assume that the read mode is selected as the device is only written to during master initialization. In the preferred embodiment, it is organized as three memories, each consisting of 256 8 bit words. Select is a data selector 222. It has three input busses 220, 220 , and 220 entering from above. One of these three is routed to a single output 224 existing below, depending upon the numeric value of the 2 bit value entering from the left. If this value is 0, then Select ignores its input and outputs zero. If this value is 1, 2 or 3, then the first, second or third input data bus respectively is routed to the output.In the preferred embodiment, it has 8 bit inputs and outputS. MV is a one bit latch 226. It is set reset during master initialization. The current state of MV exists above. Select 228 is a data selector. It has two input busses 224 and 230 entering from above.One of these is routed to a single output existing below, depending upon the state of 6 entering from the right. If e is low, then the right input bus is selected. Otherwise, the left bus is selected.In the preferred embodiment, Select has 8 bit inputs and outputs. Double skip on zero is a circuit to block the propagation of g and e, for the duration of two 8 cycles, provided that e o, MV 1 and the output from Select is zero, at the time of a positive transition of . This effectively causes the later circuit stages to ignore completely the current column These altered versions of g and 9 are then used by the central stage of the circuit. PW is a random access read write memory. Its address enters from the left and data output is to the right. In the figure, Geassume that the read mode is selected, as the device is only written to during master initialization. In the preferred embodiment, it is organized as 127 2 bit words. Ch is a random access read write memory. Its address enters from above and data output is to the right. In the figure, we assume that the read mode is selected, as the device is only written to during master initialization. In the preferred embodiment, it is organized as 256 2 bit words. Distributor is a data distributor. It has three outputs above and a 2 bit control input to the left. When this input is zero, all three outputs are zero. Xnen it is 1, 2, or 3, the first, second or third output gores high respectively, leaving the others zero. Single skip on zero is a circuit to block the propagation of , for the duration of one 8 cycle, provided that the cumulative output from the gate circuits is zero at the time of a positive transition of . This altered version of B is then used by the lowest circuit stage. Each gate is a pair of logical and gates used to control the pro sation of the data output from CW. Both bits leaving CW center each gate to the left. Inside gate there are two 2 input and gates. One input from each becomes a common control input shown entering from below. The remaining two inputs connect to the two entering data lines. The outputs from the gates are shown to the right. When the control input is low, the gate outputs zero. When it is high, gate, simply propagates its two bit input. The combination of the three gate circuits and the distributor circuit forms a variable shift register which shifts the output of CW, depending upon the output of PW. This affects the computation of the final weight. TOTN is an add latch device. Its input enters above. It is triggered on a negative e transition.In the preferred embodiment, W OTM is a 17 bit latch together with an adder having one 17 bit input and one 11 bit input. R is an add latch device. Its input enters above and its output exists below. It is triggered on a positive g transition provided that T entering from the right is equal to one.In the preferred embodiment, R is an 11 bit latch coupled to an adder having one ll bit input and one four bit input. TOTR is an add latch device. Its input enters above and its output exists below. It is triggered on a positive transition of provided tat 2 1. In the preferred embodiment, it is an ll bit latch together with an adder having one 11bit input and one four bit input. M is an add latch device. Its input enters above. It is triggered on a negative e transition.In the preferred embodiment, it is a 17 bit latch together with an adder having one 17 bit input and one 11 bit input. Sign test is defined as test of Figure 4. L is defined as L of Figure t. Tally is defined as tally of Figure 4. Adder is defined as dd ofFigure 4. Referring to Figure 5, this diagram illustrates how the basic circuit of Figure 4 may be considerably enhanced with sacrificing speed of processing. In Figure 5, before data reaches the core or data selector, circuit 102 and the basic word associator circuit 112 that is identical to that shown in Figure 9, several tasks are performed.First, a memory word is fetched corresponding to the current column position being processed. If this word is zero, then the current column is ignored. This is accomplished by using the double skip on zero circuit 220 of well known design.This circuit merely blocks propagation of all timing signals during the current character pair.Therefore, the circuit ignores the current column.Whereas the circuit of Figure 4 processed every column unconditionally, this facility permits column selection in the circuit of Figure 5. If te fetched word is non zero, then it is used to select one of three tables to be used in translating the data character from the record before it reaches the cire circuit 102 . This is called synonym processing and permits additional flexibility. The facilities above are implemented via the random access memory s SEL 208 and the three random access memory s labeled SYN 202, 204, and 206, and by the SEL 208 component which simply selects one of the three outputs from the SYN memories 202, 204, and 206. The SEL 208 is of any well known design. The SYN 202, 204 and 206 is a set of three random access memories of a well known design.If the translated value of a record character is zero and the MV flag is set, then the entire current column is ignored as above. MV 222 is a one bit latch of a well known design. This permits the definition of missing value fields so as not to detract from the measure of the similarity between the record and the query.Position bus 224 is connected to SEL 208 and P 226 that is a random access memory of well known design. The enhancements we have discussed so far constitute simple preprocessing and are not crucial to the basic invention. We now discuss some more crucial enhancements. In the circuit of Figure 4 you will note that the quantity 1 is always added to R 107.This t25 the effect of weighing all alphabet members and column positions equally. Figure 5 implements a weighing scheme wherein the column number currently under consideration and the current character are used to determine a weight which is to be added to R instead of 1 . In this way, one can weigh characters heavier than others and one can weigh columns heavier than others. Generally speaking, many circuits might compute a weight to be used to update R. Figure 5 contains one such circuit. In this circuit, each alphabet character is assigned a two bit weight. This weighs 0, 1, 2, 3 are possible.Each column position is also assigned a weight also two bits. But this weightl.is used to control a sift register so that here the possible weights are 0, 1, 2, 4. The character weight is effectively multiplied b the column weight to arrive at the final weight. A complete word associator circuit must of course contain two copies of the circuit ofFigure 5. We observe that the positional weight tables defined for each copy might differ. This might allow certain columns to be processed with more emphasis on initial or on final cbaracters. When the two tables agree, there is no such directional bias. It should be noted that when the final weight of a column character pair is zero, the character is not processed. This is accomplished by the single skip on zero circuit 230 which blocks propagation of timing singals for the duration of a single character. The weight scheme is implemented by the random access memories PW 226 and CW 242 of well known design and by the selectable shift register 244 formed by the distributor 246 and gate components 248, 250, and 252 and by the single skip on zero circuit 230, all of which are of well known designs. In the circuit of Figure 4, the final result X, needed to divide by N N L where N is the length of the words under comparison, to arrive at the measure of similarity. In the circuit of Figure 5, this denominator must be computed since it will depend upon the weights encountered during processina. In Figure 5, TOTR 254 and TOTM 256 that are addlatches, compute a denominator term. A corresponcing term is computed by the other copy of the circuit. The sum of these two terms is the final denominator. The final numerator is twice the sum of the two M values read out of the two circuit copies. The similarity between the query and bus words is the quotient of the numerator and the denominator quantities. The above is just one way in which the information read out of the circuit may be interpreted to arrive at a measurement of simpllarity. Other schemes might weighvarious terms unequally. The circuit 112 in the lower right of Figure 5 is recognizable as very similar to the circuit of Figure 4.The only difference is that the selection component is now external and R may now be updated by quantities other than 1 . The circuit of Figure 5 is divided by dashed lines into three stages designated by I, II andIII. Note that busses passing from stage to stage are broken. This indicates that buffers might be inserted to achieve a pipeline with three stages.In this way the circuit can process data as fast as the circuit of Figure 4. Without pipeline buffers, the circuit is two to three times slower.The timing signals are labeled identically in each stage but may vary from stage to stage both because of the optional pipeline and because of the skip on zero circuits. The circuit of Figure 5 must be initialized before use. A master initialization must be performed once per search to establish weights, etc. This initialization must load the SEL 208,SYN 202, 204 and 206, PW 226, and CW 242 memories.Also, the MV 222 flag must be set or reset.Before each record is processed, additional initialization is required. The tally memory in 112 not illustrated must be set to zero as must the R and M, not shown, and TOTR 254 and TOTM 256 add latches. After each record is processed, the contents of M, not shown in 112 , and TOTN 256 are read out of the circuit. Connections describing initialization and readout are trivial and of well known design and are therefore not shown in the diawings. Finally, note that in the circuit of Figure 5, the bus data character must be stable on the bus even during the processing of the query character. This permits the bus character to be translated while the query character, which does not pass through synonym translation, is processed.The query translation is better left to software since the query is fixed during a search. The instant invention has been shown and described herein in what is considered to be the most practical and preferred embodiment. It is recognized, however, that departures may be made therefrom within the scope of the invention end that obvious modifications will occur to a person skilled in the art.Industrial Applicability The associator or comparator circuit shown inFigure 4 may be constructed in electronic chip form for use as a circuit allowing inexact word queries in any system of other. Further this associator or comparator circuit may be utilized in an ssoclatlve retrieval system as shown inFigures 1, 2 and or 5. Or other industrial applications as set forth hereinabove.

They are fully decoded and have three gated memory enable inputs to simplify decoding required to achieve the desiredEMI45.1 system organization.The memories feature P N P input transistors which reduce the low level input current requirement to a maximum of 0.25 milliamperes, only one eighth that of a normalized Series 54S174S load factor. The memory enable circuitry is implemented with minimal delay times to compensate for added system decoding. The three state output combines the convenience of an opencollector with the speed of a totem pole output it can be bus connected to other similar outputs, yet it retains the fast rise time characteristic of the TTL totem pole output. To minimize the possibility that two outputs at opposite logic levels are applied simultaneously to a common bus, the output enable circuitry is designed such that the output disable times are shorter than the output enable times.write cyde The complement of the information at the data input is written into the selected location when all memory enable inputs and write enable input are low.

The high impedance third state and increased high logic level drive provide these flipflops with the capability of being connected directly to and driving the bus lines in a bosorganized system without need for interface or pull up comp onents.For applications not requiring three state outputs, the SN64174 or SN74174 max D type flip flop can be used for a 33 reduction in package count and a 40 reduction in power, or the SN54175 or SN74176 quadruple D type flip flop can be used for a similar reduction in powder. Gated enable inputs are provided on the SN64173 and SN74173 for controlling the entry of data into the flip flops. When both dataenable inputs are low, data at the D inputs are loaded into their respective flip flops on the next positive transition of the buffered clock input. Gate output control inputs are also provided.When both are low, the normal logic states high or low levels of the four outputs areEMI53.1 EMI53.2 tb SEP FUNCTION SEP TABLE tb SEP INPUTS tb SEP DATA SEP ENABLE SEP DATA SEP OUTPUT tb CLEAR SEP CLOCK SEP 01 SEP 02 SEP D SEP a tb SEP N SEP X SEP X SEP X SEP X SEP L tb SEP L SEP L SEP X SEP X SEP X SEP Oo tb SEP L SEP SEP SEP N SEP X SEP X SEP Oo tb SEP L SEP SEP SEP X SEP H SEP X SEP Oo tb SEP L SEP t SEP L SEP L SEP L SEP L tb SEP L SEP t SEP L SEP L SEP H SEP H tb SEP When SEP either SEP SEP It SEP or SEP N SEP or SEP both SEP Is SEP are SEP high SEP the SEP output SEP is SEP tb SEP disabled SEP to SEP the SEP high impedance SEP state SEP however SEP sequential tb SEP OperatiOn SEP of SEP the SEP flip flop SEP is SEP not SEP affected.

The outputs are disabled independently from the level of the clock by a high logic level at either output control input. The outputs then present a high impedance and neither load nor drive the bus line. Detailed operation is given in the function table.Rated at 5.2 mA high logic level drive current, up to 128 of the SN74173 outputs may be connected to a common bus and still drive two Series 54 74 TTL normalized loads. Similarly. up to 49 of the SN54173 outputs can be connected to a common bus and drive one additional Series 54,74 TTL load. To minimize the possibility that two outputs will attempt to take a common bus to opposite logic levels, the output control circuitry is designed so that the average output disable times are shorter than the average output enable times by 10 nanoseconds. The SN54173 andSN74173 are guaranteed to accept clock input frequencies up to 25 MHz.
