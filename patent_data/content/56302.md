# Electroacoustic transducer.

## Abstract
An electroacoustic transducer includes a filling or access port for introducing an inert liquid into a chamber 12 defined by a housing 6, 8 . Ths access port includes a bubble trap 18, 20, 22 and a vent 28, 34 for extracting gaseous bubbles from the fluid fill. The vent is provided in a plunger 26 which is mounted at the outer end of the bubble trap by means of a flexible sealing member 36 and which applies a substantially zero pressure to fluid fill within the bubble trap.
