# Copying apparatus.

## Abstract
A copying machine comprising an image signal generat ing unit 100 including a solid image pickup element 5, 101, 355 for converting an optical image into an electric signal an ion generating source 8, 303 and an electrostatic image forming unit 300 including an ion control electrode 7, 301, 360, 371 . The ion control electrode 7, 301, 360, 371 has a control electrode 307, 360a, 371b and a common electrode 305, 360b, 371a arranged to face each other through an insulating layer 306 and formed with fine openings 309 arranged in a row or in plural adjacent rows. At least one of the electrodes being divided into such a plurality of blocks as has its one or plural openings electrically insulated at a close spacing across the aforementioned arranged openings 309 and as are wired to receive electric signals from the aforemen tioned image signal generating unit, the common electrode 305, 360b, 371a being operative to control the flow of ions, which are directed toward a charge holder 9, 302 , if neces sary, together with the control electrode 7, 301, 360, 371 in response to a bias voltage applied. A reference voltage cor responding to the color to be recorded is preset so that the voltage, corresponding to the difference between the refer ence voltage and the signal voltage is applied to the control electrode 307, 360a, 371b of the ion control electrode 7, 301, 360, 371 .
