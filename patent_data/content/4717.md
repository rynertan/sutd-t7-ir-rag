# Improved method for separating solids from coal liquids.

## Abstract
The rate of separation of suspended mineral particles from a coal liquid is increased by adding a mixture of a hydrocarbonaceous oil and a calcium salt, such as calcium carbonate, to the coal liquid. The increase in the separation rate is achieved even though the coal mineral particles naturally contain a calcium salt. The premixing of the calcium salt with hydrocarbonaceous oil considerably enhances the separation rate as compared to the addition of the calcium salt alone even when the hydrocarbonaceous oil is a distillate fraction which is derived from the coal liquid itself.
