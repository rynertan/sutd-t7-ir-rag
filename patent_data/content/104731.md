# 3 Hydroxybutyrate polymers.

## Abstract
3 Hydroxybutyrate polymers are formed into oriented shaped articles by drawing a partially crystallised preform to increase at least one dimension by at least 200 , and then increasing the degree of crystallisation while maintaining the drawn preform in the drawn condition.
