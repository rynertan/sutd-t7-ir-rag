## Description
LATERAL PNP TRANSISTOR AND METHODField of the Invention This invention is a novel structure and method for forming a sub m1cron bipolar dielectrically isolated transistor utilizingVLSI chip processing steps to fabricate hundreds of such devices simultaneously. Background of the Invention Techniques extracted from the prior art come from the field of sub micron fabrication technology wherein the dimensional resolution is now comparable to or even smaller than the thicknesses of the thermally grown silicon oxide layers on silicon. Also the dimensions are now comparable to or even smaller than the base widths used for double diffused transistors, i.e., 0.4 1.0 micrometers.From these techniques the novel structure and method for the bipolar transistor with greatly reduced parasitic capacitance and resistance have been devolved ln untie combination and sequence. Summary of the Invention The invention is a novel lateral PNP transistor formed on a P substrate by making a recess in the substrate bounding the region for the transistor, N doping the substrate transistor active region via the recess, deepening the recess portions into the original P substrate, P doping opposed edge portions of the recess via said recess and filling the recess with field oxide.Conventional electrical connections are established to each of the Pf spacedapart portions and to the N doped intemediate portions with the latter comprising the base for the transistor and theformer Pf regions being the collector and emitter.Brief Description of the Drawings FIG. lis a view in cross section through a region of the s4b strate where a single transistor will be formed showflng photoresist outlining the regions to be recessed into the substrate and also protecting the active region of the transistor FIG. 2 shows the substrate slotted along the boundary recess regions with N doping introduced to the substrate active region via the recess edges and bottom.

Description of the Preferred Embodiment The drawings including FIGs 1 6 show a preferred fabrication method for the structure of FIG. 7 with the steps being recited in preferred order and each function accomplished by a preferred specified processing step. In FIG. 1, the P type substrate 11 may comprise silicon or silicon on sapphire. The substrate 11 is first optionally oxidized, as shown at 16. It is then covered with a photoresist layer 13 which is masked, exposed to actinic radiation, and the photoresist removed where soluble in the regions 15 and 17 which outlines the portions of the substrate to be slotted or recessed around the boundary of the active region 19 FIG. 2 for a single transistor, shown as that region covered by the photoresist 131. In FIG. 2, the slots 21 and 23 have been milled into substrate ll in the regions 17 and 15 while the other regions were protected by the photoresist 13 and optional oxide. It will be understood that slots or recesses 21 and 23, as shown in FIG. Z, only bound the active region 19 on two sides, but in reality this boundary recessing or slotting extends completely about the transistor active region 19, as illustrated in FIG. 7 wherein the slot portions 21 and 23 are seen as bounding two sides of region 19, whereas slots 25 and 27 bound the other two sides, such that the entire active area 19 is bounded by recesses or slots l.e. a peripheral recess. Returning to FIG, 2, the next step In the preferred process is the deposition of arsenic or phosphorous into slots 21 and 23 to form the N doped regions beneath and between the slots 21 and 23 within substrate 11 above the original P doped substrate line 37. Following the N doping step to form the Pf regions, silicon oxide is grown over the entire exposed surface of substrate ll, as shown at 16 and 16 . If oxide layer 16 was originally employed as in FIG. l it is merely thickened in this step. In FIG. 3, boron has been diffused into the substrate via the slots 21, 23 to form the P regions 31 and 33. Proceeding to FIG. 4, the slots 21 and 23 are millet deeper, as shown by the extensions 21 and 23 which penetrate substrate 11 deeper than the Pf doped regions 31 and 33. Also, any remainijig silicon oxide lining slots 21 and 23, as deepened, is removed following conventional practices. Here the N type regions are indicated as 35, 358, 35 and 35 . The N to P region of substrate 11 Is now roughly defined by the line 37. It will be seen that the N region is beneath the slot 21 extension 21 and the slot extension 23 extension 23 , and also occupies the region between the pt active portions 31 and 33. In FIG. 5, the third deepening of slots 21 and 23 is effected, again preferably by ion milling, to extend them to their bottoms 21 and 23 which now penetrate the P substrate region beneath curve 37. This third deepening may be accomplished in the second deepening of FIG. 4, but is illustrated in FIGs. 4 and 5 to emphasize the underlying P isolation in contact with the slot oxide filling for total separation of the active regions. The substrate 11 is then oxidized sufficiently to fill the slots 21 and 23 completely with silicon oxide and to cover the substrate 11 with a surface layer 51 of silicon oxide. At this stage it may be noted that the silicon oxide of the recesses or slots completely electrically isolates the P NP active region of the transistor device being formed in the active region within this isolation boundary. In FIG. 6 the oxide has been stripped completely off the top, shown as the oxide 51 , as by etching, to allow for the optional arsenic N implant, indicated by the Nf designatRon at 53. One way of achieving this type doping is to use low energy arsenic diffusion for the N regions and high energy arsenic diffusion for the Nf regions. Also, in FIG. 6, a layer of metallization has been applied to the upper surface of the substrate ll, and it has been covered by photoresist and patterned, removed where soluble, and the metalilza tion etched away to leave the particular metal conductors 55 and 57 shown in contact with the P region 31 and P region 33. In the same manner the base lead 59 FIG. 7 has been formed from the metallization and patterning steps, as shown in FIG. 6 such that electrode connections are made to emitter region 31, collector region 33 and base region 59. It will be noted from FIG. 7 that the sectional view for FIG. 6 is taken along the plane 5 5. Also, the transistor of FIG. 7 is sized 4d X Sd to occupy an area of 20d , wherein d is a dimen simon of 0.4 to 1 micrometer.It may be seen that the vertical dimension comprises the first d for the base region 59, the second d for the spacing between the base region and the emitter region 31, the third d for the width of the emitter region 31 and d 2 d 2 for the spacing between electrode 55 and the extremes of the Ns region 31 with the fifth d encompassing one recess 25. The dImension in the orthogonal direction utilizes the first d for the width of the recess 21, the second d for the spacing to the electrode 59, the third d for the width of the base electrode 59 and the fourth d measures to recess 23. In summary, these bipolar transistors have extremely small areas and the parasitic capacitance and resistance is also greatly reduced.The total size of the transistor is not much greater than the active area of the transRstor, The base emitter junction capacitance and the collector base capacitance are made very small. Also, the base spreading resistance is small. Since the base width can be made small, i.e., approaching approximately 0.1 micrometers, a high gain and low transit time can be achieved. Also, a symmetrical transistor with a very low collector to emitter saturation voltage is available. Further, the collector resistance is also very small. While departures from the aforementioned process can be made by substituting doping materials for Ron lmplantRng or ion 1mplantRng steps for doped materials, nevertheless the principles of the invention are uniquely set forth in the appended claims which it intended measure the scope of this invention, wherein
