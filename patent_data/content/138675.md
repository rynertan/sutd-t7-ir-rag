# VIRTUAL ADDRESS MAPPING USING A 2 LEVEL TRANSLATION BUFFER

## Abstract
A circuit for translating virtual addresses to physical ad dresses particularly for use in a single chip microprocessor 10 . A main translation buffer 40 , which has a small number of address conversions, is located ont he microprocessor. A back up translation buffer 62 is located off the microproces sor chip whith a larger number of address conversions. If the main translation buffer does not have the address conversion required by a particular virtual address, it transmits over lines 46 the virtual address to the back up translation buffer. If the back up translation buffer has the address conversion, it trans mits it to the main translation buffer over lines 48 . If the back up translation buffer also does not have the required address conversion, it transmits a miss signal over line 64 to control circuitry 54 on the microprocessor chip which performs the translation using tables 72 in main memory 70 . The address conversion is then transmitted over lines 68 to both the main and back up translation buffers.
