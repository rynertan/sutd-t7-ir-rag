# Compound gear arrangements.

## Abstract
A plurality of substantially axially aligned gear trains 10 12 each has an input sun gear 13 and two output ring gears 15 and 16 or 17 , the output ring gears being relatively rotatable in response to rotation of the sun gear 13 . Adjacent ends of the sun gears 13 are drivingly coupled by dogs 33 which permit limited axial misalignment between the gear trains 10 12 . The teeth of planet pinions 18, 19, 20 between the sun gear 13 and the ring gears 15,16,17 are formed so as to have cross sections which reduce in direction away fromthe median cross sections P of the pinions 18, 19, 20 . Adjacent ends of the ring gears 15 and 16 or 17 are spaced apart to permit limited axial misalign ment.
