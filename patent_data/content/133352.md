# A process for manufacturing microcapsules.

## Abstract
A process for manufacturing microcapsules comprises in situ polymerisation of a urea or melamine formaldehyde poly mer precursor material in an aqueous manufacturing vehicle in the presence of one of a range of specified acrylic acid alkyl acrylate copolymers containing a critical proportion of alkyl acrylate. The resulting capsules may be used in pressure sensitive copying materials.
