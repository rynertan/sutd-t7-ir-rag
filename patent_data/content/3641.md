# Method and apparatus for producing a composite pipe.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for producing a composite pipe employing an endless steel belt as a mold 1 , the belt being wound on a mandrel M and moving axially while rotating in the circumferential direction thereof. In order to provide constant wall thickness of the resultant pipe, a thickness regulative device 2 , which may be a roll of cylindrical or tapered form, is spaced at a predetermined distance from the outside of the mold 1 and the molding material with a binder 11 is fed between the mold 1 and the device 2 .
