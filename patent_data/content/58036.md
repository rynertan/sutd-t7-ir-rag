# Optical ambiguity function generator system.

## Abstract
The optical ambiguity function generator system in cludes a first Bragg cell 35 for coding a coherent light beam with a first signal, a first Fourier Transform lens 36 receiving the coded signal, a linear phase shifter 37 lying in the Fourier Transform plane of the first lens, a second Bragg cell 40 for coding the light beam received from phase shifter 37 with a second signal and a second Fourier Transform lens 41 receiving the light beam from the Bragg cell 40 to produce an ambiguity function at an ambiguity plane. The phase shifter comprises a part cylindrical lens 50 and a part spherical lens 51 fastened together, the part spherical lens being of opposite sign and of one half the focal length of the part cylindrical lens.
