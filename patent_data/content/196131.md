# Amplifier arrangement.

## Abstract
A high efficiency amplifier of the class G type comprises a first transistor T₁ , whose collector is connected to a first supply voltage V₁ via a first diode D₁ , and a second transis tor T₂ , which is connected in series with said first transistor and which has its collector connected to a second supply volt age V₂ . The first transistor T₁ is driven via a third transistor T₃ , which is arranged as an emitter follower by means of a first current source 5 , the input voltage V
