# Multiple magnification mode copying apparatus.

## Abstract
A multiple magnification mode copying apparatus in cludes a full and half rate scanning mirror system 15, 41 and a lens 18 for forming an image of an object to be copied. The lens 18 may be shifted along its optical axis to any one of a plurality of predetermined positions to change the magnification mode of the apparatus, and at the same time shifted transversely of the optical axis by the appropri ate amount for each of said predetermined positions in order to maintain one edge of the image adjacent one edge of the copy regardless of the magnification mode. The half rate mirror system 41 is also shifted so as to achieve the required conjugate lengths. The means for shifting the lens comprises a first cable and pulley system 81 79, 80, 83, 84, 99 , and the means for shifting the half rate mirror system comprises a second cable and pulley system 45 50, 52, 53, 56 , the two cable and pulley systems being driven by a single driving means 54 . The single driving means drives the cable 81 of the first cable and pulley system, and the cable of the first cable and pulley system drives an intercon necting shaft 91 . The cable 45 of the second cable and pulley system is driven, for shifting the half rate mirror system, by the interconnecting shaft 91 .
