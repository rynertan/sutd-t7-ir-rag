## Description
The present invention relates to a coupler for use in association with single mode fibers. A common problem in the design of single mode optical components is the need to provide efficient and stable optical coupling. Typically, this coupling is between two single mode optical fibers located at different ports on a given device. A standard method of coupling two single mode fibers requires the expansion of the input beam passing through an input single mode fiber using a lens, often a graded index GRIN lens. The expanded beam then passes through the optical component s after which a second lens focuses the beam onto the core of the output single mode fiber. A problem with such method is the sensitivity to misalignment at the fiber lens interface. This misalignment creates both the need for precise micropositioning during fabrication and the need to maintain a stable fiber lens bond while the device is in use. According to the present invention there is provided an optical arrangement as defined in claim 1. The present invention provides an optical coupler which utilizes a section of multimode fiber as a lens. In a preferred embodiment, the coupler is directly fused onto the end of the transmission fiber. A graded index fiber, is defined as a fiber with an index of refraction that is a function of the various glasses used to form the concentric layers of core and cladding in the fiber, thus providing a more gradual change in refractive index than the step index fiber. One particular form of graded index fiber, which may be used in association with the present invention, can be defined as a square law medium, where the radial dependence of the refractive index in a square law medium can be represented by In order to provide the advantages of single fiber uniformity with a minimum of misalignment between the communication fiber and the fiber lens, it is desirable, although not necessary, to utilize a multimode fiber lens which comprises the same outer diameter as the single mode communication fiber. The two fibers can be joined by a fusing process, the surface tension of the molten glass tending to self align the multimode fiber lens to the single mode fiber, thus facilitating the alignment. The coupling lens is formed from a section of optical fiber, thus allowing the lens to be directly fused to the endface of the single mode fiber. As stated above, the utilization of a fusion joining process provides a coupling arrangement which is more rugged and less susceptible to subsequent misalignment problems. FIGS. 2 4 illustrate the steps involved in an exemplary fusion process using a section of graded index multimode fiber to form the fiber lens. The first step is to fuse the endface of a single mode fiber 12 to the endface of a graded index multimode fiber 16. This is accomplished, as shown in FIG. 2, by placing the ends of fibers 12 and 16 in a heat source 18, for example, an electric arc, which results in forming a low loss fusion region between single mode fiber 12 and graded index multimode fiber 16. As stated above, the maximum expansion of an input beam occurs if graded index multimode fiber lens 16 comprises a quarter pitch length. Such length, if desired other lengths also often being desirable, as hereinafter discussed , can be obtained simply by scribing and breaking the fiber 16 at the desired location. However, this method is difficult to control. In an alternative method, fused fibers 12 and 16 are placed in a housing to provide additional structural support and subsequently polished to the desired length. As shown in FIG. 3, a capillary tube 20 may be used as such a housing, where fused fibers 12 and 16 are waxed or epoxied in place. FIG. 4 illustrates a fiber lens coupler 22 which has been polished to achieve the desired quarter pitch length. It is to be noted that subsequent to the final polishing, housing 20 may be removed, where such removal may be necessary when the size of the coupler is required to be as small as possible. Alternatively, housing 20 may be left intact to provide a degree of additional stability and ruggedness. An alternative coupling arrangement, shown in FIG. 5, utilizes a length of a step index multimode fiber 16 Having, as above described, formed a fiber lens combination, e.g., the fused together single mode and multimode fiber section 12 and 16, respectively, one use not illustrated of such combination is in connection with another single mode fiber which can be fused to the free end of the multimode fiber. The result is a length of multimode fiber butt fused between two single mode fibers, one of which can be considered as an input fiber coupling a light signal to the other output single mode fiber via the intermediate multimode lens fiber. Alternatively, as described hereinafter, two separate fiber lens structures can be used as the input and output coupling means for an optical component disposed between the two fiber lens structures. The quarter pitch fiber lens, useful when two single mode fibers are to be butt coupled or maintained in relatively close proximity, may not provide sufficient coupling between fibers which are significantly displaced. It is often necessary to separate input and output fibers by a considerable distance, e.g., in the range of a few millimeters. In this case, a quarter pitch graded index fiber lens is not desirable since the collimation of the beam exiting the fiber lens is not perfect, i.e., the beam width continues to expand, resulting in poorer coupling to the output fiber. For large separations, optimum coupling occurs when using fiber lenses which are longer than quarter pitch length. FIG. 6 illustrates such an arrangement, where each fiber lens 16 comprises a length L greater than the quarter pitch length. Referring to FIG. 6, a guided input light beam I passes through single mode input fiber 12 To further explain the relationship between fiber lens length and coupling efficiency, FIG. 7 illustrates coupling loss in dB as a function of axial displacement for two exemplary coupling arrangements utilizing fiber lenses formed in accordance with the present invention. The first arrangement utilizes a pair of quarter pitch length 251 µm graded index fiber lenses in particular, AT T 62.5 125µm fiber , where the loss associated with this arrangement is illustrated by curve A. The second arrangement utilizes a pair of graded index fiber lenses, each fiber lens comprising a length 300 µm greater than the quarter pitch length. As expected, the quarter pitch length fiber lens arrangement experiences minimum loss, 0 dB, when the fibers are butt coupled i.e., axial displacement equals zero . Curve B indicates that this exemplary extended length fiber lens arrangement exhibits an 0 dB coupling loss when the input and output fibers are separated by approximately 250 µm. A 2dB loss is experienced by the quarter pitch length fiber lens arrangement when the fibers are displaced by 500µm, where as the extended length fiber lens arrangement can be displaced by an additional 200µm, to a distance of approximately 700 µm, before a 2dB coupling loss is observed. If the extended length fiber lens is used in a butt coupled arrangement, it will exhibit a loss of approximately 0.5dB, which is greater than 0.0dB quarter pitch length fiber lens arrangement. As illustrated in FIG. 8, fiber lenses formed in accordance with the present invention are compared with unlensed fibers with respect to lateral misalignment tolerances. The data for the fiber lenses is obtained from actual measurements, whereas the data for the unlensed fibers is obtained using the equations referred to above in association with the Kishimoto article. Referring to FIG. 8, a 5 µm lateral displacement between conventional unlensed single mode fibers results in a reduction in coupling efficiency from 100 for zero displacement to approximately 30 . This is a serious reduction, since a 5 µm tolerance is often used in the industry as the maximum allowable tolerance. Using an exemplary graded index multimode fiber lens arrangement of the present invention provides a coupling efficiency of approximately 80 , well within industry specifications for this 5 µm tolerance. In fact, as seen by reference to FIG. 8, a lateral displacement of 10 µm between the single mode fibers will not completely disrupt transmission when the exemplary fiber lens arrangement of the present invention is used since a coupling efficiency of over 40 exists for this misalignment. However, when no lensing arrangement is used, transmission is essentially lost between two fibers which are displaced by 10 µm. It is to be noted that with selective choice of multimode fiber parameters, both the axial and longitudinal misalignment tolerances can be increased considerably. In addition to using the fused fiber lens of the present invention in the above described one to one coupling arrangement, the present invention is applicable to situations using fiber array coupling arrangements. Fiber arrays are often arranged in what is referred to as a ribbon configuration, i.e., a l x N array. Connecting two ribbons together is an extremely difficult task which, by the nature of the proximity of the fibers to each other, demands almost perfect alignment. Utilizing the fused fiber lens coupling arrangement of the present invention overcomes this alignment problem since, as described above, the use of a fusion region between the single mode transmission fiber and the multimode fiber lens overcomes the alignment problems associated with prior art coupling arrangements.
