# Data receiving apparatus.

## Abstract
Data receiving apparatus for receiving repetitively transmitted blocks of data stores a block of data registered 10 , and compares comparator 12 each received byte in DI with the corresponding stores byte in D n . If the bytes match M a data selector 15 selects either byte for storage and sets a flag bit for that byte in a register 14 to 1. If the bytes do not match, the data selector selects the new byte when the existing flag bit is 0 and selects the old, stored byte when the existing flag bit is 1, in either event setting the flag bit to 0. In this way the probability is that each stored byte is an error free byte. A status circuit 16 signals when all flag bits are not 1 to indicate that suspicion nevertheless attaches to the block as stored.
