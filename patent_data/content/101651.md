# Process for highly selective production of polyalkylbenzenes.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for preparing 1,2,4,5 tetraalkyl benzene at high selectivity by alkylating 1,2,4 trialkylbenzene with an alkylating agent and a specific zeolite catalyst which has a defined adsorptive capacity and shape selectivity.
