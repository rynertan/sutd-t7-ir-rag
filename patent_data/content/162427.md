# Improved thermal burning rod.

## Abstract
An improved rod for a thermal cutting or burning torch, especially suited for underwater use, is shown to have a metallic outer tube sheath containing exothermic fuel ele ments within the interior of the tube, providing an open re gion for the passage of gas to the tip of the tube. The tube is electrically insulated along its outer length, save for an exposed open end adapted to be clamped in an electrically conductive gas providing cutting torch handle. Within the improved rod, each of the fuel elements consists of a gen erally ferrous composition having one of two types of coat ings. In a first embodiment, an element will be coated with a copper cladding to approximately two percent of the overall weight of the element. In the second embodiment, an ele ment will be clad with either aluminum, or one of the alu minum class of metals, to approximately 4.6 percent by weight, the exact percentage being that percentage required for perfect thermite combustion.
