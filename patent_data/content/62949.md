# Television transmitter.

## Abstract
A television transmitter comprises a video processing circuit 2 an amplitude modulator 4 a vestigial sideband filter 8 an R.F. amplifying stage 9 and a klystron amplifier 10 which feeds an antenna 22 . The klystron is provided with a grid electrode 12 to which a video signal is applied to density modulate the beam current. The video signal applied to the grid electrode 12 is derived from the output of the video processing circuit 2 and fed via a low pass filter 6 and a d.c. isolating circuit 20 to an amplifier 21 which provides a signal of the desired amplitude at the grid electrode 12 . The filter 6 is arranged to restrict the bandwidth of the video signal applied to the grid electrode 12 to less than that of the vestigial sideband in order to reduce the possibility of re inserting the higher frequencies into the vestigial sideband. The d.c. isolating circuit isolates the video signal source from the cathode and grid potentials of the klystron which are typically between 10 and 30 K volts.
