## Description
The present invention relates to a process for the selective removal of acidic gases, such as hydrogen sul phide and carbon dioxide from mixtures of gases, specifi cally natural or synthesis gases, which contain them, particularly suitable for the processing of gaseous mix tures with even very high concentrations of acidic gases. To start up the production of gas fields with gases having a high content of acidic gases, or to the purpose of purifying the synthesis gases produced by starting from fuel oil or from coal, the need presently exists of having available treatment processes suitable to handle gases with high and very high contents of acidic compo nents, able to yield products with even very strict specification. The treatment of such gases requires the adoption of mixed cryogenic and solvent using technologies, so as to combine the advantages of both technologies, a good puri fication of the gases with acceptable costs being obtain ed. The same Applicant has already claimed a process of such a type by the United Kingdom Patent Nr. 1.555.068 granted on January 9, 1980. In such patent application, the purification is reported of a raw gas containing more than 70 of acidic gases, by the combined use of a low temperature distillation, and of absorption by solvent. The solvents described are dimethylether polyethyl eneglycol and propylene carbonate. It has been found now a new purification process particularly suitable to the treatment of gases contain ing high concentrations of acidic gases, based on the use of mixtures of selective solvents particularly suitable to be used in the purification processes by the cryogenic cycle. Sais process allows, among others, the two purge streams containing CO₂ and H₂S respectively to be obtain ed substantially separated. The process of the present invention for the selec tive removal of the acidic gases from natural gases or from synthesis gases by means of adsorption in two absorb er towers and cooling of the gas outcoming from the first tower to condense a portion of CO₂ contained in the same gas, is characterized in that in it use is made of a mixture constituted by low molecular weight alcohols, esters and ethers belonging to the following classes Esters of alcohols of general formula R₁COOR₂, wherein R₁ and R₂ are alkyl groups of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, equal to or different from each other, wherein one or more hydrogen atoms can be substituted by alcoholic groups, such as methyl formate, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, monoethyleneglycol acetate. esters of glycols of general formula The above reported solvents have a combination of several properties particularly favourable for their use as selective solvents. They have indeed a high stability under the use conditions, high solvent power for the acidic gases, high selectivity for H₂S and CO₂ relatively to hydrocarbons, low molecular weight and low melting point. This last characteristic is essential for the application in a cryogenic process. In the case of the processing of natural gas, after the condensation at low temperature and before the end absorption by solvent, the gas is available at low tempe ratures, considerably lower than 0 C. During the end absorption, it is useful to be able to reach temperatures considerably lower than the gas temperature, which are very favourable, because in this way the absorption power of the solvent and its selec tivity increase. The solvents of the process according to the invention show low melting point and are hence parti cularly suitable for use in a cryogenic process. The organic compound can be added in proportions comprised within the range of from 0.3 to 40 by weight relatively to the weight of the resulting mixture. The above described mixture can be used in a three step system, such steps comprising The cooling of the gas substantially purified from H₂S can take place in a heat exchanger by vapourizing a portion of CO₂ contained in the CO₂ rich mixture in a suitable point of the regeneration. It is preferable that the acidic gases not condensed after the cooling be at a concentration not higher than 30 by mol in the gas phase, and it is still more prefer able that they be comprised within the range of from 15 to 30 by mol. The cooling of the gas substantially purified from H₂S can also take place inside the second absorber tower. By means of such a cooling, which causes part of CO₂ to condense, the distillation tower used in the prior proc esses is eliminated. The mixture used for the absorption of H₂S in the first absorber tower can be regenerated first by means of one or more expansion steps at maximum, three of such steps from which above all the useful components co absorbed in step a are recovered, then by means of one or more further expansion steps at maximum, four of such steps , from which mainly H₂S evolves, and subsequently by means of a distillation tower from the top of which mainly H₂S outcomes the mixture thus regenerated is recycled to the second absorber tower. A portion of the mixture used for the absorption of CO₂ in the second absorber tower can be regenerated by means of one or more expansion steps at maximum, three of such steps from which above all the useful components co absorbed in step b are recovered, followed by one or more further expansion steps at maximum, four of such steps , from which mainly CO₂ evolves after such regene ration, said portion is recycled to the second absorber tower. The residual portion of the mixture used for the absorption of CO₂ is on the contrary fed to the first absorber tower. The useful components which evolve from the expan sions of the mixture rich in H₂S are compressed, cooled and recycled to the first absorber tower, whilst those which evolve from the expansions of CO₂ rich mixture are compressed, cooled and recycled to the second absorber tower. As an alternative, the useful components of the H₂S rich mixture and of the CO₂ rich mixture can be recovered by expanding the two streams of rich mixture in an iden tical number of steps and under the same pressures, then recycling by one single compressor the components reco vered to the absorber tower. The expansions of the mixtures rich in H₂S and CO₂ can be carried out in an expansion valve, or, at least partly, in a turbine. The regeneration by expansion of the mixture rich in CO₂ can be integrated with the heating of the same mix ture, in order to promote the removal of CO₂ by evapora tion and recover cooling power to be used in the process. The expansion steps from which mainly CO₂ evolves can be from 1 to 4, producing streams of CO₂ under pro gressively lower pressures, of which, one or two can be kept under vacuum, in which case the acidic gases evolved must be compressed again. In some cases, on the contrary, operating under vacuum is not necessary, because the end pressure is a function of the temperature reached and of the purification level desired. The streams mainly containing CO₂ produced under high pressures can be expanded by means of an expansion valve, or by a turbine, to the delivery pressure, to the purpose of producing work and refrigerating effect. r The first absorber tower operates under a pressure comprised within the range of from 20 to 110 kg cm² and at a temperature comprised within the range of from 30 C to 40 C the second absorber tower operates under a pressure comprised within the range of from 20 to 110 kg cm² and at a temperature comprised within the range of from 100 C to 10 C finally, the distillation tower for the regeneration of the solvent operates under a pressure comprised within the range of from 0.1 to 5 kg cm², and at a head temperature comprised within the range of from 60 C to 10 C and at a bottom temperature comprised with in the range of from 10 C to 200 C. Atop the first absorber tower a rectification unit can be installed, in order to reduce the losses of ab sorbing mixture entrained by the head gas of the absorber tower, the head condenser of which is cooled by the CO₂ rich mixture outcoming from the second absorber tower before the same mixture be fed to the first absorber tower. Another possible contrivance consists in adding the mixture to the natural or synthesis gas outcoming from the first absorber tower before said gas be cooled by heat exchangers or expansion in valve or turbine, to the purpose of preventing that CO₂ crystallization may occur. The absorbing mixture of the second absorber tower can be drawn from an intermediate point of the same absorber tower, cooled by using at least a portion of the residual cooling power of the gas processed and or by using at least a portion of the residual cooling power of CO₂, and fed to the tower immediately under the drawing point. The exhausted mixture leaving the first or the sec ond absorber tower can be mixed with the natural or synthesis gas and cooled to the purpose of carrying out a preliminary absorption and of discharging the absorber. At last, a further contrivance consists in mixing at least once the regenerated mixture with the gas or gases outcoming from one or from both of the absorber towers, the mixtures thus formed being then cooled to the purpose of separating the regenerated mixture from the same gas. The mixing or the mixings between the gas or the gases outcoming from one of from both of the absorber towers and the absorption mixture are preferably carried out in a mixer by feeding such streams in countercurrent to each other. Said mixings are preferably two when carry ing out a plurality of mixings is desired. In case the gas, or each gas outcoming from one absorber tower under goes two mixings, such mixings can be carried out in the following way first, a mixing of the gas being treated with the regenerated mixture takes place, and then to said mixing a cooling and a separation follows of the mixture obtained, thus from the gas the regenerated mix ture being separated, which mixture is in its turn mixed in a second mixing step with the gas leaving the absorber tower. To said second mixing step a cooling and a separa tion follows of the mixture obtained in said second mixing, from the gas, which is fed to the first mixing, the regenerated mixture, which is fed to the absorber tower, being separated. The two coolings following the two mixings can be carried out at the same temperature or at different temperatures, preferably within a temperature range be tween 50 and 100 C. The invention shall be now better described with re ference to the flow sheet of attached Figs. 1 and 2 which show preferred forms of embodiment, which however must not be considered as limitative of the same invention. Referring to Fig. 1, the raw gas is supplied to the plant by the piping 1, and is washed in countercurrent flow in the first absorber 2. The absorber is equipped with a rectification unit and with a reflux condenser 3 to the purpose of knocking down the vapourized mixture. The gas is then cooled, thus the most of CO₂ condensing in the heat exchanger 4, it is added to the mixture, metered by the valve 5 to the purpose of preventing CO₂ from crystallizing, and is expanded to the treatment pressure by the valve 6. The expanded gas is washed in countercurrent flow by the mixture in the absorber 7 to the purpose of removing CO₂. The gas leaving the absorber 7 is mixed with comple tely purified mixture and is cooled in the heat exchanger 8, is separated from the mixture in 9 and is sent to the recovery of the refrigerating power in the heat exchan gers 10 and 11, and is then supplied to the distribution system by means of the piping 12. The cooled mixture, separated from the gas in 9, is pumped into the absorber 7 by the pump 13. Further mixture, not completely puri fied, is introduced into the absorber at an intermediate level. In order to reduce the average absorption tempera ture, the mixture is extracted from an intermediate tray of the absorber 7, is pumped in 14 and cooled in 10 by the treated gas. A portion of the mixture rich in CO₂ leaving the absorber 7 is sent by means of the pump 15 and of the valve 16 to cool the dephlegmator 3 and then to the absorber 2, wherein H₂S is absorbed. The H₂S rich mixture is expanded in the valve 17 and is sent to the separator 18 the vapours are recompressed by 19 back to the absorber 2 the liquid is expanded in the separator 20 and then in the regeneration tower 21 by means of valves 22 and 23 the gas rich in H₂S evolved in 20 leaves the plant through the valve 24. The mixture is regenerated from H₂S and CO₂ in the regenerating tower 21, equipped with condenser 25, reflux accumulator 26, reflux pumps 27, reboiler 28 this latter is heated by any heat source. The acidic gases outcoming from 26 are combined with those outcoming from the valve 24. The regenerated mixture is cooled by outer refrige rating means either air or water, and or a suitable refrigerating cycle in 29 and by the rich mixture in 30 and is then sent to the heat exchanger 8 by means of the pump 31 and of the metering valves 32, after having been cooled in the heat exchanger 33. The portion of mixture rich in CO₂ not used for H₂S absorption is regenerated by expansion. It is fed to the separator 34, through the valve 35, wherein a methane rich gas develops, which is recycled back to the absorber 7 by the compressor 36, after cooling by the treated gas in 11. The mixture outcoming from 34 is expanded by the valve 37, is heated in 38, and is fed to the separator 39, from which CO₂ evolves said CO₂ is heated in 40 and 41 and is then discharged from the plant. The mixture outcoming from 39 is expanded under vacuum by the valve 42, is heated in the exchanger 43 and is then sent to the separator 44. CO₂ is compressed to nearly atmospheric pressure in compressor 45 the mixture still containing meaningful amounts of CO₂ is sent through the pump 46 and the metering valve 47 to an intermediate level of the absorber 7. The heat exchanger 38 can be the same exchanger 4 which are on the contrary shown separated in the Fig ure in such case, the mixture outcoming from 34 is heated, a fairly good amount of CO₂ contained in the raw gas from the first absorber tower being condensed. The exchanger 43 can be the same exchanger 8 also in this case, they are separately shown in the Figure . By the above described flow diagram obtaining is possible a treated gas containing less than 1 ppm of H₂S and less than 10 ppm of CO₂. Another possible route to recover the co absorbed useful products is shown in Fig. 2. The rich mixture leaving the absorber 2 is directly fed to an exhausting unit 50 installed under the absorber 2. The heat is supplied to the exhausting unit by suita ble heating fluids in the bottom reboiler 51 and in the intermediate reboiler 52. In this latter, the tower bot tom product, which contains now only negligible amounts of useful products, is cooled. It is expanded in the valve 22 and sent to the separator 20. The new equipment pieces 50, 51 and 52 replace the equipment pieces 17, 18 and 19 of Fig. 1. The same equipment can be used to the purpose of recovering the useful compound co absorbed in the absorb er 7 of Fig. 1, by sending a portion of the rich mixture leaving the absorber 7 to an exhausting unit. Here, the equipment pieces to be replaced for by the exhausting unit and ancillary equipment are 34, 35, 36 and 11.
