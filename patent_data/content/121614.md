## Description
PERFLUOROTRICYCLIC AMINE COMPOUNDS This invention relates to a novel perfluorotricyclic amine compound useful as an oxygen carrier in an artificial blood or in an infusion fluid. More particularly, it relates to perfluoro tricyclic amine compounds represented by the general formulaEMI1.1 wherein R denotes a perfluoroalkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, the ring A denotes a five or six membered ring, the ring B denotes a five , six or seven membered ring, the ring C denotes a five or six membered ring, and f, g, h, i, j and k denote integers appropriately selected to construct the above mentioned size of rings A, B andC. In that case, the compound may be substituted by one or more lower perfluoroalkyl group s in addition to the above mentioned substituent R. Regarding the general formula I , as mentioned above, f, g, h, i, j and k are integers appropriately selected to construct a five or six membered ring A, a five , six or seven membered ring B and a five or six membered ring C, respectively. Individually, each of the integers is appropriately selected, for example, from 1, 2, 3 and 4 for f O, 1 and 2 for g 0 and 1 for h and 0, 1, 2 and 3 for each of i, j and k. In the general formula I , the lower perfluoroalkyl group denoted by R may be either of straight chain or of branched chain. Examples thereof include those having 1 to 4, preferably 1 to 2, carbon atoms, such as perfluoromethyl group, perfluoroethyl group, perfluoro n propyl group, perfluoroisopropyl group, perfluoro n butyl group, perfluoroisobutyl group, perfluoro sec butyl group and perfluoro tert butyl group. Rings A, B and C, especially rings A andC may be substituted at any position thereof by one or more than one, preferably one or two, lower perfluoroalkyl group s in addition to the abovementioned substituent denoted by R. Examples of the lower perfluoroalkyl groups suitable as such substituents are similar to those which are described above referring to R. Perfluoromethyl group is especially preferred. In case where two or more of substituents are present, they may be different from each other. The total number of carbon atoms present in the compound of formula I is generally from 8 to 12, preferably 10 or 11. As an embodiment of the compound of formula I , mention may be made of a compound represented by the general formulaEMI3.1 wherein rings A, B and C are as defined above f g h i j k Q m n 5 or 6 f denotes 1, 2, 3 or 4 g denotes 0, 1 or 2 h, Q, m and n denote eachO or 1 and i, j and k denote each 0, 1, 2 or 3. The compound of formula I can be prepared by fluorinating a perhydro compound corresponding to the compound of formula I . The methods of fluorination include, for example, a direct fluorination, a fluorination by use of cobalt trifluoride, and an electro chemical fluorination. The preparation of the compound of formula I of this invention is preferably performed by the electrochemical fluorination method. This is performed, for example, by mixing anhydrous hydrogen fluoride and a perhydro compound used as the starting compound in an electrolytic cell and subjecting the resulting solution to electrolysis. The voltage, the current density at the anode, and the temperature of electrolytic solution are normally 3 9 V, 0.2 3.0 A dm2 and 4 100C, respectively. The compound of formula I thus formed was drained from the bottom of the cell, being insoluble in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. The isolation and purification of the compound from the drained product are carried out, for example, by adding a mixture of equal volumes of an aqueous alkaline solution and an amine compound to the drained product, reflexing, then separating the lowermost layer containing the desired compound of formula I the partially fluorinated compounds decomposed in this process , washing the former layer with an aqueous acetone solution containing a suitable amount of potassium iodide to remove perfluoroalkyl nitrogen fluorides, and by subsequent fractional distillation to obtain the fraction of the desired compound of formula I . Since the compound of the formula I of this invention can dissolve a large amount of oxygen, chemically and biologically inert, and can be excreted rapidly from the body, it can form, for example, an aqueous emulsion containing 5 to 50, preferably 10 40, W V of the compound of formula I to be used as an oxygen carrier in an artificial blood or in an infusion liquid for men and other mammals such as dogs, cats, cattle, mice, rats and guinea pigs. The symbol W V referred to herein mean the amount of the material by weight gram based on 100 ml of the resulting emulsion. In the preparation of the emulsion mentioned above, there used, as an emulsifier, a nonionic surfactant or phospholipids in an added amount of 1 to 5 W V . As the medium for the emulsion, a physiologically acceptable aqueous solution is employed. If necessary, there may be added thereto such materials as inorganic salts to provide the desired isotonicity, and such plasma expanders as HES or dextran to regulate the osmotic pressure of the emulsion. The emulsion can be prepared by mixing the above mentioned ingredients and homogenizing the mixture by means of, for example, a highpressure jet type homogenizer until the particle diameters become 0.05 to 0.3 pm, preferably less than 0.2 pm. The perhydro compounds starting compounds corresponding to the compounds of formula I are substantially known already.Example The equipment employed in the fluorination was a Monel reaction cell, through which coolant could be circulated for temperature control. Power was supplied to the cell pack by a O 50 amp, 0 50V DC power supply. The cell pack consisted of 13 nickel plates more than 99.68 purity separated with Teflon spacers, and arranged alternately so that the seven odd numbered plates were cathodes and the six even numbered plates were anodes. The spacing between plates was 1.7 2.0 mm.The cell was equipped with a copper condenser, through which coolant was circulated by a refrigeration unit. The progress of an electrolysis was monitered by a voltage current recorder. In the electrolytic cell, was placed 1.2 liter of hydrogen fluoride, and trace amounts of impurities present in the system moisture or sulfuric acid were removed by preliminary electrolysis. Then, 0675 mol 102 g of 4 methyl 4 azatricyclof5,2,1,02 6Jdecane was introduced into the cell, and the electrolysis was continued, while introducing nitrogen gas from the bottom of the cell at a rate of 100 ml min., under the conditions of anode current density of 0.4 2.0 A dm2, voltage of 5 7 V and solution temperature of 7 120C, until the ampere hours amounted to 730.Fresh anhydrous hydrogen fluoride 300 ml was added every 24 hours during the electrolysis. No attempt was made to collect volatile products formed by a bond breaking reaction.After completion of the electrolysis, fluorocarbons in the lower layer in the cell was drained through the bottom of the cell, weighed 260 g 57 yield . To the fluorocarbons thus separated, were added equal volumes of 70 aqueous potassium hydroxide solution and diisobutylamine, and the resulting mixture was ref fluxed for about five days. The reaction mixture was then cooled in an ice bath.The perfluoro compounds sedimented in the lowermost layer were separated in a separatory funnel, washed successively with water, concentrated sulfuric acid, saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and 90 aqueous acetone solution containing 3 of potassium iodide, and finally several times with water to yield 162.0 g of perfluoro compounds containing no protons. This was distilled on a fractional distillation apparatus equipped with a spinning band column to afford 39.2 g 8.6 yield of the desired product boiling at 143 1520C. This product was purified, then analyzed by infrared absorption spectrometry, F nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometory and mass spectrometory, and was confirmed to be the objective compound, perfluoro 4 methyl 4 azatricyclot5,2,1,02 6ldecane. A series of other perfluorotricyclic amine compounds were synthesized and purified in the same manner as that described above and each product was confirmed to be the objective compound upon analysis by infrared absorption spectrometory, 19Fnuclear magnetic resonance spectrometory and mass spectrometory. The structural formula and the boiling point of each ofthe objective compounds is shown in theTable. The symbol F 11 in the structural formula indicates that the compound is perfluorinated.
