# Non invasive chemical species delivery apparatus.

## Abstract
A bioelectrode for non invasive and inotophoretic deliv ery of chemical species such as ions, polar molecules, etc. into the skin of a person. The bioelectrode includes a pouch 4 having flexible walls 8,12 , at least a portion of which is composed of a porous, permeable or semipermeable mem brane 12 . The pouch holds fluid 20 which contains the chemical species to be delivered through the skin. An elec trode 24 is attached to the pouch so that when the pouch is placed against the skin, with the membrane portion in con tact with the skin, and an electric potential is applied to the electrode, whemical species in the pouch are caused to migrate through the membrane and into the skin.
