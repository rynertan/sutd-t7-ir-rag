# Initializing apparatus for daisy wheel printer.

## Abstract
An LED photodetector structure 54, 34 is disclosed positioned to cooperate with a daisy wheel print element 10 of a daisy wheel printer and a light interrupter 40 such that under microprocessor control, a stepping motor will rotate and home the daisy wheel print element 10 , sense the escapement pitch corresponding to that element 10 , sense the font weight or impact force level associated with that print element 10 and then cause the carrier to be translated to the left frame, thereby engaging the light beam interrupter 40 with the left frame and forcing it into the light beam indicating the presence or the carrier at a known spacial position for homing of the carrier position. The print element has apertures 20, 24, 26, 28, 30 formed in the hub 22 thereof which are all spacially positioned within one semicircular portion of the print element hub 22 and which denote the home position of the print element 10 and coded values representing escapement pitch and impact level for that print element.
