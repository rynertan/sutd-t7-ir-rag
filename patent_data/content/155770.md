# Process for the preparation of a supported catalyst based on vanadium compounds for the polymerisation and copolymerisation of ethylene and the catalysts obtained thereby.

## Abstract
New catalysts which can be used for the polymerisation and copolymerisation of ethylene, comprising a support consisting basically of magnesium chloride on which is deposited by precipitation a vanadium compound, obtained by bringing a vanadium compound in which the vanadium is at one of the two maximum valencies 4 and 5 in contact with a support consisting basically of magnesium chloride and optionally of aluminium chloride and comprising products of an Mg C bond.
