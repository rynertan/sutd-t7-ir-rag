# Aromatic polyamide paper like sheet and processes for producing the same.

## Abstract
An aromatic polyamide paper like sheet having excellent heat and chemical resistances and electric insulating properties, comprises an artificial pulp ingredient comprising a number of amorphous pulp particles consisting of an aromatic polyamide material, and a fiber ingredient consisting of a number of short fibers bonded to each other with the amorphous pulp particles, the ratio in weight of the artificial pulp ingredient to the fiber ingredient being in a range of from 1 9 to 9 1 and the aromatic polyamide molecules contained at least in the amorphous pulp particles being cross linked with a cross linking agent.
