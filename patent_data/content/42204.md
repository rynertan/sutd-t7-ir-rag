## Description
This invention relates to reactive dyes in particular to triazinyl dyes linked by the residue of an ortho phenylene diamine. It is now well established to manufacture cellulose reactive dye stuffs whose structure is essentially chrom N R G 2 N R N R D where Chrom is the radical of a chromophoric compound R, R and R are H or lower alkyl G is s triazine residue bearing a cellulose reactive substituent and N R N R D is the N,N di radical of a diaminee Many aliphatic and aromatic diamines have been proppsed to provide D. See for example UK 854432 and 1283771. It has often been proposed to use optionally substituted phenylene diamines. These have almost always been the meta or para isomers but recent publications Japanese 78 060935 and 77 085585 and German OLS 2658268 have shown the use of ortho phenylene diamines. We have now found a novel class of reactive dyes derived from ortho phenylene diamines which are often associated with good strength and build up. According to the present invention ere are provided cellulose reactive dyestuffs which in the free acid form are of the formula EMI1.1 wherein A isEMI2.1 where n is 1 or 2 EMI2.2 where Y is H, Cl or SO3H R is H or C1 4 normal alkyl R and R are each independently H, CH3 or C2H5 T is Cl, Br, F, SO3H or a quaternary ammonium group EMI2.3 where Z is H, H, SO3H, , or COOH m is 1 or 2 and W is H,Cl, CH3 or OCH3. As examples of the group A there may be mentioned 1,5 disulphonaphth 2 yl 1,6 disulphonaphth 2 yl 1,5,7 trisulphonaphth 2 yl. As examples of the group B there may be mentioned 1 hydroxy 3 sulpho 2,6 naphthylene 1 hydroxy 3,5 disulpho 2,6 naphthylene 1 hydroxy 5 chloro 3 sulpho 2,6 naphthylene. The term quaternary ammonium group in the definition of T above embraces any group which comprises a positively charged nitrogen atom linked to the triazine nucleus and bearing three substituent bonds which may link to separate groups or two or three of them may link to different atoms of a single group so that with the nitrogen atom a heterocyclic ring is formed. Thus the term embraces, for example trialkyl ammonium groups such as trimethyl or ethyl dimethyl harmonium and pyridinium groups. It is often preferred that the group is a carboxy pyridinium group, for example that derived from nicotinic acid. As examples of the group D there may be mentioned 1,2 phenylene 4 methyl I , 2 phenylene 4 methoxy 1,2 phenylene 4 sulpho 1,2 phenylene 4carboxy 1 ,2 phenylene 3,4 dimethyl 1,2 phenylene 4,5 dimethyl 1,2 phenylene Preferred dyes of formula 1 are thoae having one or more of the following features a A is 1,5 disulphonaphth 2 yl b B is I hydroxy 3,5 disulpho or especially Irhydroxy 3 sulpho 2,6 naphthylene c T is F or especially Cl d R is CH or especially H e one of R and R is CH and the other H or especially both are H 3 f D is defined by having Z H or sulpho, m I and W H or methyl i.e. ortho phenylene, sulphophenylene or tolylene radicals. The present invention also provides a process for the manufacture of dyes of formula 1 in whichT is C1, Br or F which comprises reacting a diamine of the formula EMI4.1 with two moles of a triazinyl compound of the formulaEMI4.2 where A, B, R, R , R , W, Z and m have the meanings given above and T is C1, Br or F. This process can conveniently be carried out by stirring the reactants in an aqueous medium, optionally in the presence of a water soluble organic solvent, at a temperature of from 20 600C, and preferably maintaining the pH at from 5 8 by adding an acid binding agent to neutralise the hydrogen halide formed during the reaction.Suitable acid binding agents are alkali metal hydroxides, carbonates and bicarbonates. As examples of diliunines of formula 2 there may be mentioned ,2 phenylene diamine 4 methyl 1,2 phenylene diamine 4 methoxy 1,2 phenylene diamine 4 sulpho 1,2 phenylene diamine 4 carboxy 1,2 phenylenediamine 5 methyl 1,2 phenylenediamine 3,4 dimethyl 1,2 phenylenediamine 4,5 dimethyl 1,2 phenylenediamine N methyl I ,2 phenylenediamineN,N dimethyl 1,2 phenylenediamine 5 sulpho 1 amino 2 N methylaminobenzene. Triazinyl compounds of formula 3 may be conveniently obtained, for example, by reacting cyanuric chloride at 0 200C in an aqueous medium1 with an ami.noazo compound of the formula A N N B These aminoazo compounds can themselves be obtained by a conventional coupling reaction with the diazonium salt of a naphthylamine A.NH2 and an aminonaphthol HBN R H. With the aminonaphthols necessary to give the dyes of the present invention it is usual to acetylate the amino group before coupling and remove the acetyl group by hydrolysis after coupling. Alternatively the aminonaphthol may be first reacted with the cyanuric halide then coupled with the diazonium salt of ANH2 to give the triazinyl compound of formula 3 . As examples of naphthylamines A.NH2 there may be mentioned 2 naphthylamine 1,5 disulphonic acid 2 naphthylamine 1,6 disulphonic acid 2 naphthylamine 1,5,7 trisulphonic acid. As exampls of aminonaphthols RB.N R H there may be mentioned 2 amino 5 hydroxy 7 sulphonaphthalene 2 N methylamino 5 hydroxy 7 sulphonaphthalene 2 amino 5 hydroxy 1,7 disulphonaphthalene 2 N ethylamino 5 hydroxy 7 sulphonaphthalene 2 N butylamino 5 hydroxy 7 sulphonaphtha 2 amino 1 chloro 5 hydroxy 7 sulphonaphthalene The dyes of the present invention may also be manufactured by reacting the diamine of formula 2 with two moles of cyanuric halide followed by two moles of tha aminoazo compound A N N B N R H. This process is usually only of any interest when the diamine of formula 2 bears a water solubilising group. The present invention further provides a process for the rnanufacture of dyes of formula 1 in which T is SO3H or a quaternary ammonium group which comprises reacting a dye of formula 1 in which T is Cl, Br or F with an alkali metal hydrogen sulphite or thc appropriate tertiary amine or pyridine compound. Such a reaction is normally carried out in aqueous media at 30 to 100 C. The dyestuffs prepared by the above processes may be isolated by any conventional means, e.g. spray drying or precipitation and filtration. The dyes are represented above in their free acid form and may be sometimes isolated as such. However, it is usually found more convenient to isolate the dyes in the form of salts particularly alkali metal sa7t.s, especially sodium. The dyestuffs of the present invention may be used for colouring a wide range of textile materials containing hydroxy or amino groups, e.g. wool, silk, synthetic polyamides and natural or regenerated cellulose, for example cotton or viscous rayon materials, by conventional methods mused for colouring such materials with water soluble reactive dyes, e.g. in the case of cellulose they are preferably applied in conjunction with a treatment with an acid binding agent, e.g. caustic soda, sodium carbonate, phosphate, silicate or bicarbonate, which may be applied to the cellulose textile materials before, durin or after The application of the dyestuff. The dyes of the present invention are valuable reactive dyes for cellulose. They yield coloured textiles with good resistance to washing and light. They are usually characterised by good strength and an ability to build up to high depths of shade. In this last respect they show unexpected superiority over closely related known dyes. The invention is illustrated by the following Examples in which all parts are by weight and proportions in wt vol are grams 100 millilitres.Example 1 To a neutral solution of 12.8 parts of the trisodium salt of 2 2 ,4 dichloro s triazin 6 ylamino 61lI , 5 disulphonaphth 2 ylazo 5 naphthol sulphonic acid prepared as described in Example 1 of United KingdomSpecification No.837990 in 300 parts of water at 10 C there are added 1.02 parts nf 3,4 diaminotoluene. The reaction mixture is stirred at 400C for 1 hour the pH being maintained at 7 by the addition of a 2N aqueous solution of sodium carbonate, when condensation is complete. Sodium chloride 5 is added, the mixture is filtered and the residue on the filter is then dried. The dyestuff composition so obtained is found to contain 1.0 atom of hydrolysable chlorine for each azc group present. When applied to cellulose textile materials in conjunction with treatment with an acid binding agent, the dye shows excellent build up properties and yields strong reddish orange shades having excellent fastness to washing and to light.
