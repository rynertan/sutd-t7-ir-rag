## Description
The present invention relates to sterically hindered mono substituted amino acids and their preparation by a one step reductive condensation of an amino acid and a ketone. It also relates to tertiary amino acids and their preparation by reacting the sterically hindered mono substituted amino acid with an aldehyde to produce the corresponding tertiary amino acid. The sterically hindered mono substituted amino acids, the tertiary amino acids and their mixtures are useful promoters for alkaline salts in hot pot acid gas scrubbing processes. It has recently been discovered that certain lower aliphatic sterically hindered mono substituted amino acids derived from glycine or alanine, especially N secondary butyl glycine, are quite useful as promoters in the hot pot acid gas scrubbing process. These amino acids may be used alone, as co solvents for other hindered amines, such as cyclohexyl 1,3 diamine, or in admixture with tertiary amino acids as hereinafter described. These sterically hindered mono substituted amino acids not only perform well, but do not form undesirable by products. N secondary butyl glycine has the CAS RegistryNumber of 58695 42 4 and is mentioned in U.S. Patent Nos.3,894,036 3,933,843 3,939,174 and 4,002,636, as well as the published literature Kirino et al., Agric. Biol.Chem., 44 1 , 31 1980 . Nothing is said in these disclosures about the synthesis of this amino acid. Existing processes for producing amino acids, particlarly for preparing sterically hindered amino acids, frequently involve the use of either expensive starting materials, a plurality of synthesis steps, or costly recovery procedures, either of which may result in high costs to the end user. Reductive alkylations of amino compounds with aldehydes and ketones are also generally described inOrganic Reactions, Preparation of Amines by ReductiveAlkylation , Vol. 14, pp. 174 255. Some examples of these reactions include U.S. Patent No. 4,190,601 which discloses the reductive alkylation of secondary amines with either aliphatic aldehydes or aliphatic ketones,Skita et al., Ann. 453, 190 1927 which describes the synthesis of N alkyl amino acids or their derivatives by reductive condensation e.g., it shows the reaction c pyruvic acid and an amine or amine derivative HoubenWeyl, vol. 11, part 2, page 327 Scheibler and Baumgarten,Ber. 55, 1358 1922 which describes the reaction of the bisulfite derivative of acetone with the ethyl ester of glycine. It has now been discovered that mono substituted amino acids such as N secondary hydrocarbyl and substituted hydrocarbyl glycines and alanines can be easily prepared in one step by reacting an amino acid having a primary amino group and a ketone under reductive condensation conditions in the presence of a reductant and a catalytically effective amount of hydrogenation catalyst at an elevated temperature and at superatmospheric conditions. This process provides high yields of the sterically hindered mono substituted amino acid with minimal formation of by products e.g., disubstituted products and allows for the use of inexpensive and uncomplicated procedures to separate the product. Unexpectedly, only the mono substituted amino acid is produced, even when an excess of ketone is employed.As such, the mono substituted amino acid can be prepared directly in a pure state without going through the salt of the acid. As another embodiment of the invention, the mono substituted amino acid product is reacted with an unhindered aldehyde in the presence of a reductant and a catalytically effective amount of a hydrogenation catalyst at elevated temperatures and at superatmospheric conditions to produce thereby the corresponding tertiary amino acid. The reductive alkylation can be carried out in the same reactor as used for preparing the mono substituted amino acid and under the same conditions, by simply adding the aldehyde to the reactor after the reductive condensation with the amino acid and ketone is complete. A mixture of the mono substituted and tertiary amino acid can be prepared by simply controlling the proportion of reactants second reaction. Another aspect of the invention includes, as a composition, the mixture of N secondary hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl glycine or alanine and N secondary hydrocarbyl, N alkyl glycine or alanine. This novel mixture, conveniently prepared by the process of the invention, is a superior promoter in the hot potw acid gas scrubbing process and it is stable against degradation.The mole ratio of the amino acids may vary greatly, depending upon the conditions used. Preferably, the mole ratio will range from 1 3 to 3 1, more preferably 1 1.The mixture may also include other ingredients such as alkaline salts such as potassium carbonate which are used in the hot pot acid gas treating process. The amount of alkaline salt will generally range from 5 to about 40 weight percent, based on the total weight of the composition. The composition may also include other materials such as corrosion inhibitors, and the like. The need for anti foaming agents is not as great as with other promoters, a particularly useful advantage of this new composition. Still another aspect of the invention pertains to novel secondary and tertiary amino acids which are useful in gas treating processes. The preferred process of the invention involves the reductive condensation of glycine or alanine with a ketone in the presence of a reductant such as hydrogen and a catalytically effective amount of a hydrogenation catalyst. The preferred reaction may be illustrated by the following general equation EMI3.1 wherein R is hydrogen or methyl and R and R are a substituted or unsubstituted, linear or branched alkyl radicals having one to twenty carbon atoms, preferably from one to eight carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, iso butyl, sec. butyl, pentyl, iso pentyl, hexyl, isohexyl, heptyl, iso heptyl, octyl, iso octyl, decyl, undecyl, pentadecyl, eicosyl and the like or b when R and R are taken together, they may be substituted or unsubstituted alkylene radicals having from three to six carbon atoms, such as trimethylene, tetramethylene, pentamethylene, and the like forming a cyclic ketone such as cyclobutanone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone and the like or c substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl radicals having from four to eight ring carbon atoms, such as cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, 2 methyl cyclohexyl, cyclooctyl and the like or d substituted or unsubstituted hydroxyalkyl radicals, linear or branched, having from one to twenty carbon atoms, preferably from one to eight carbon atoms, such as hydroxymethyl, hydroxyethyl, hydroxybutyl, hydroxyoctyl, hydroxydecyl, hydroxyeicosyl and the like or e substituted or unsubstituted aralkyl radicals having from seven to twenty carbon atoms, preferably from seven to twelve carbon atoms, such as benzyl, phenethyl, 4 methylbenzyl and the like. The R and R groups may be substituted with a wide variety of substituent groups. Typical substituents include groups such as hydroxyl, ether linkages, silane groups, and heterocyclic rings containing oxygen atoms in their rings. Such groups are selected, of course, such that they will not interfere with the reductive condensation process. Illustrative ketones suitable for use in the invention include acetone, 2 butanone, 2 pentanone, 3 pentanone, 2 hexanone, 3 hexanone, 2 heptanone, 3 heptanone, 4 heptanone, 2 octanone, 3 octanone, 4 octanone, nonanones, decanones, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, cycloheptanone, cyclooctanone, methylisopropylketone, methylisobutylketone, methyltertiarybutylketone, diisopropylketone, diisobutylketone, ethylisopropylketone, ethyl isobutylketone, ethyltertiarybutylketone, methyl secondaryamylketone, ethylsecondaryamylketone, methyltertiaryamylketone,. methylsecondaryamylketone or mixtures of these ketones. The amino acids used in the process are those containing a primary amino functionality such as glycine or alanine. The hydrogenation catalyst to be used in the process of the invention may include any of the known hydrogenation catalysts. Illustrative hydrogenation catalysts include platinum, palladium and other platinum metals such as ruthenium, rhodium, osmium and iridium deposited on inert supports such as carbon, silica and other refractory oxides, Raney nickel, nickel on kieselguhr, copper chromite, nickel on inert support, massive nickel coprecipitated with silicate or aluminum salts having alumina or kieselguhr supports. The preferred catalyst is palladium on carbon. The concentration of the hydrogenation catalyst is that which is catalytically effective and that amount will generally range from about 0.1 weight percent to 10 weight percent, preferably from about 2 weight percent to 8 weight percent, based on the total weight of the ketone, amino acid and solvent charged in the reactor. The normal pretreatment conditions and handling of the hydrogenation catalyst should be practised as known to those skilled in the hydrogenation catalysts art. The.theoretical equivalent mole ratio of ketone to amino acid in the reaction charge is 1 1. However, in practice, an excess of ketone is used and therefore the mole ratio generally varies from 1.1 to 10 1, preferably from 1.2 to 8 1, most preferably from 1.1 to 1.5 1. As discussed above, even the use of excess ketone results only in mono substituted N secondary amino acid. The reductive condensation reaction is carried out under pressure at a temperature ranging from about 20 C to 200oC, preferably from about 500C to 150 C. As the temperature is decreased, the hydrogenation rate also decreases allowing incomplete conversion and by product formation. As the temperature is increased, the hydrogenation rate generally increases and allows for complete reaction of the reactants. The reductive condensation of the ketone an amino acid should be carried out at superatmospheri pressures, preferably from about 3.5 to 210.9 kg cm2, more preferably from 35.2 to 105.4 kg cm2. A greater hydrogenation pressure will not hinder the reaction. Lower hydrogenation pressures may result in slower hydrogenation rates and incomplete conversions. It is often desirable to include in the reaction medium an inert organic solvent, such as methanol, methanol, isopropanol and the like. The organic solvent should be of low molecular weight to facilitate removal from the product of the reaction. The amount of the organic solvent may vary, but will generally range from about 10 to 50 wt , preferably from 15 to 30 wt , based on the weight of reactants used. The reaction mixture may also include water to help solubilize the amino acids.Typically, the amino acid charged into the reactor will be dissolved in water and the ketone will be dissolved in the organic solvent. In carrying out the reductive condensation, a reductant is supplied to the reactor. The reductant may be hydrogen or a hydrogen generating compound, preferably hydrogen. It has been observed that the time required for the complete cessation of the hydrogen absorption in the laboratory experiments at the preferred conditions is usually about 4 8 hours. The time required in a particular reaction will vary and is dependent upon specific reactants, catalyst, temperature and pressure used, as well as the size of the batch, as is known to those skilled in the art. The hydrogenation may be terminated prior to the cessation of hydrogen absorption although this leads to a lesser yield of mono substituted amino acid. Once the reaction has been completed, the mono substituted amino acid can be conveniently recovered by known techniques such as solvent evaporation and or addition of a precipitant. Unexpectedly, the resulting sterically hindered mono substituted amino acid will not react further even when excess ketone is used. This is contrary to other similar processes involving the condensation of carbonyl compounds and amino compounds. For example, aldehydes typically provide disubstitution. If it is desired to prepare a tertiary amino acid from the mono substituted amino acid, one then subjects the mono substituted amino acid to reductive alkylation with an unhindered substituted or unsubstituted aldehyde, preferably an aldehyde having from one to twenty carbon atoms. More preferably the aldehyde has one to six carbon atoms, and still more preferably one to two carbon atoms. In this manner, both the secondary and tertiary amino acid can be synthesized from simple amino acids such as glycine or alanine. The mixture can be prepared in one pot, if desired, by simply adding the aldehyde after the ketone amino acid condensation reaction is completed. As such, a mixture of amino acids represented by the following formulae is obtained EMI7.1 wherein R is hydrogen or methyl, and R and R are selected from a substituted or unsubstituted, linear or branched alkyl radicals having one to twenty carbon atoms or b substituted or unsubstituted alkylene radicals each having three to six carbon atoms and combined to form a cyclic ring or c substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl radicals having from four to eight ring carbon atoms or d substituted or unsubstituted hydroxyalkyl radicals, linear or branched, having from one to twenty carbon atoms or e substituted or unsubstituted aralkyl radicals having from seven to twenty carbon atoms, and wherein R is selected from substituted or unsubstituted linear alkyl radicals having from one to twenty carbon atoms. The mole ratio of the two amino acids may widely vary, but preferably ranges from 1 3 to 3 1, and more preferably from 1 1. The preferred amino acids will be those where R is hydrogen or a methyl radical, and R and R are each selected from C1 C6 hydrocarbon radicals and R is a methyl or ethyl radical. The most preferred amino acids will be those where R is hydrogen, R and Rw are each selected from C1 C3 hydrocarbon radicals and R is a methyl radical. A particularly preferred mixture includesN secondary butyl glycine and N secondary butyl N methyl glycine. Alternatively, the reaction of the sterically hindered mono substituted amino acid and the aldehyde may be carried to completion. As such, the corresponding tertiary amino acid, as defined above, may be recovered and used as a promoter or co solvent for sterically hindered amines in hot potw acid gas treating processes or as catalyst for epoxide or thioepoxide resins. The invention is illustrated further by the following examples which, however, are not to be taken as limiting in any respect.

The tertiary amino acid can be prepared from secondary amino acids by alkylation. For example, n butyl sarcosine can be prepared quite effectively via the reductive alkylation of sarcosine with butyraldehyde.EMI12.1 Such a tertiary amino acid in combination with a hindered secondary amino acid such as isopropyl glycine or sec. butylglycine, etc., is an extremely effective K2CO3 activator for acid gas scrubbing. Tertiary amino acids can be prepared with some difficulty from ketones and a non hindered secondary amino acid by alkylation to introduce an additional alkyl group. For example, the reductive alkylation of an unhindered amino acid with a ketone can give tertiary amino acid.EMI13.1 These tertiary amino acids such as N methyl N secondary butylglycine are extremely effective in combination with a secondary amino acid such as N sec. butylglycine. One disadvantage to this approach is that the alkylation proceeds with some difficulty. Another is that monoalkyl amino acids like sarcosine are considerably more expensive than glycine, and it would be desirable to use glycine as the starting material. This can be accomplished if one first alkylates glycine with a ketone by reductive condensation to produce the sterically hindered monoalkyl secondary amino acid. For example, as shown by the equation EMI13.2 Such sterically hindered secondary alkyl amino acids will not react further even when excess ketone is used.However, if an unhindered aldehyde such as formaldehyde is introduced, N secondary butyl glycine is converted to a tertiary amino acid such as N secondary butyl N methylglycine as shown by the following equation EMI13.3 Thus, both the secondary and tertiary amino acid can be synthesized inexpensively and readily from glycine. What is even more attractive is that a desirable one pot direct synthesis of the mixture is now possible.Glycine can be reacted with excess ketone to form the sterically hindered amino acid and an aldehyde can then be charged into the reaction vessel in the desired proportion to produce a mixture of secondary and tertiary amino acids. This mixture need not be isolated and can be prepared in an aqueous solution which can be used directly for the purpose of K2C03 activation in acid gas scrubbing. Another attractive feature of these amino acid promoted systems in contrast to the combination of theN cyclohexyl 1,3 propanediamine pipecolinic acid as shown in U.S Patent No. 4,094,957 is that the amino acid combination is non foamy. Thus, the need of adding an antifoam is minimized or eliminated. The following examples illustrate the preparation of the tertiary amino acids by the process of the present invention.Example 7Synthesis of N Methyl N Secondary Butyl Glycine MSBG Into a one gallon autoclave 338 g 4.5 mole glycine, 1.2 liters methanol, 10g 10 Pd C and 500 g methylethylketone were combined. The reaction mixture was pressurized to 77.3 kg cm2 and heated between 105 1150C.Pressure was maintained between 63.3 and 77.3 kg cm2 and after about two hours 63.3 kg cm2 hydrogen was consumed.The autoclave was cooled and 180 g 6 moles paraformaldehyde and 5 g 10 Pd C added and repressurized with about 77.3 kg cm2 hydrogen. The vessel was heated and 75.2 kg cm2 of hydrogen was consumed within 1.5 hours and a maximum temperature of 1230C. The product was concentrated to 800 ml volume by heating up to 1250C, and two liters of acetone and 5 1 of ether were added. No solids were formed and the solution was concentrated to 1.2 liters, diluted to 4.3 liters with acetone and cooled in a freezer. No solids formed so the solution was concentrated at 1180C to 150 ml and placed in a dish in an oven at 75 800C for two days and then cooled in a dry box. The waxy crystallineMSBG weighed 847 g, 99 yield. The product was purified by stirring with 2.5 liters acetone plus 500 ml ether.The mixture was cooled for 3 hours. The solid was filtered and washed with ether and dried in a 450C oven giving 485 g of product, 74 yield. Example 8Synthesis of N Methyl N Secondary ButylGlycine Aqueous Solutions Into a one gallon autoclave 338 g 4.5 mole glycine, 1 liter H20, 10 g 10 Pd C, and 500 g methylethylketone were combined and hydrogenated as in Example 7. At 1100C, 52.7 kg cm2 of hydrogen was consumed in 3.5 hours. After cooling 365 g of 37 4.5 moles aqueous formaldehyde was added. The hydrogen pressure was maintained between 63.3 and 77.3 kg cm2 while heating and 52.7 kg cm2 hydrogen was consumed below 650C within about 1.5 hours. The resulting solution was filtered and concentrated on a hot plate to about 1200 ml. 1272 g of a solution containing 52.7 solids theory 51.3 solids was obtained.Example 9Synthesis of N Methyl N Secondary Butyl Glycine N Secondary Butyl Glycine Mixtures in Aqueous Solutions Mixtures of SBMG and SBG of any desired ratio can be prepared directly and where aqueous solutions are desired the product mixture can be obtained as an aqueous concentrate and diluted before use. The following procedure is for an equimolar solution of the two. Into a one gallon autoclave 506 g 6.75 mole glycine, 750 ml methanol, 15 g 10 Pd C, and 750 g methylethylketone were combined and hydrogenated between 63.3 and 77.3 kg cm2 hydrogen. Within 2 hours at up to 1120C, 87.9 kg cm2 hydrogen was consumed. After cooling 274 g 3.375 mole of 37 formaldehyde and 5 g 10 Pd C were added. The reaction consumed 49.2 kg cm2 of hydrogen in 45 minutes at up to 420C. The resulting solution was filtered warm and 946 g of distillate removed until a head temperature of 950C was obtained. The residual solution weighed 1244.5 g 75 solids . The following examples illustrate the use of the sterically hindered mono substituted and tertiary amino acids as promoters in the hot pot acid gas treating process. Example 10 Hot Pot Acid Gas Treating Process The reaction apparatus consists of an absorber and a desorber as shown in Figure 1 of U.S. Patent No.4,112,050. The absorber is a vessel having a capacity of 2.5 liters and a diameter of 10 cm, equipped with a hefting jacket and a stirrer. A pump removes liquid from the bottom of the reactor and feeds it back to above the liquid level through a stainless steel sparger. Nitrogen and CO2 can be fed to the bottom of the cell through a sparger. The desorber is a liter reactor, equipped with teflon blade stirrer, gas sparger, reflux condenser and thermometer. The following reagents are put into a 2 literErlenmeyer flask 55 g of N cyclohexyl 1,3 propanediamine CHPD 22.8 g of N sec. butyl glycine SBG 225 g of K2CO3 447 g of water When all solid has dissolved, the mixture is put into the absorber and brought to 800C. The apparatus is closed and evacuated until the liquid begins to boil. At this point CO2 is admitted. In total, 39.1 liters of CO2 is absorbed. The rich solution is transferred to the desorber and boiled for one hour, during which time 30 liters of CO2 is desorbed. The regenerated solution so obtained is transferred back to the absorber and cooled to 800C. The apparatus is closed and evacuated until the liquid begins to boil. At this point CO2 is admitted. 33 liters of CO2 is absorbed, of which 12 liters is absorbed in the first minute. If the above cycle is repeated, replacingN sec. butyl glycine with 22.5 g of pipecolinic acid, the amount of CO2 desorbed is 28.5 liters and the amount of CO2 reabsorbed is 31.3 liters. The rich solution containing K2CO3, N cyclo hexyl 1, 3 propane,diamine and N sec. butyl glycine is regenerated by boiling it for an hour, and is then used for a phase behavior study. About 600 g of regenerated solution is charged into a l liter autoclave equipped with a window, reflux condenser and inlet and outlet for gases. The autoclave is brought to 1210C while blowing therethrough a mixture containing .28 CO2 and 99.8 He at about 0.2 liters minute.When the outgoing gas has the same composition as the entering gas, equilibrium is reached. Only one phase is present. If the experiment is repeated, replacing N sec.butyl glycine with water, two liquid phases are present at equilibrium.Example 11 Using the apparatus described in Example 10, the following two experiments are carried out to demonstrate the use of a N secondary butyl glycine b the blend ofN secondary butyl glycine SBG and N methyl N secondary butyl glycine MSBG as the sole promoters for potassium carbonate in the hot pot acid gas treating process. a The following reagents are put into a 2 liter Erlenmeyer flask 92 g of N sec. butyl glycine 225 g of K2C03 433 g of H2O When all solid has dissolved, the mixture is put into the absorber and brought to 800C. The apparatus is closed and evacuated until the liquid begins to boil.At this point CO2 is admitted. In total, 32 liters is absorbed. The rich solution is transferred to the desorber and boiled for an hour, during which time 28 liters of CO2 is desorbed. The regenerated solution so obtained is transferred back to the absorber and cooled to 800C. The apparatus is closed and evacuated until the liquid begins to boil. At this point CO2 is admitted. 29.6 liters of CO2 is absorbed, of which 13 liters is absorbed in the first minute. b The following reagents are put into a 2 liter Erlenmeyer flask 46 g of N sec. butyl glycine SBG 51 g of N methyl N sec. butyl glycine MSBG 225 g of K2CO3 428 g of H2O When all solid has dissolved, the mixture is put into the absorber and brought to 8O0C. The apparatus is evacuated until the liquid begins to boil. Then CO2 is admitted and the rate of absorption and the total capacity are measured. Regeneration is carried out as above. The regenerated solution absorbed 32.5 liters of CO2, with about 12 liters being absorbed in the first minute.Example 12 a Aging Studies in CO2 Scrubbing Apparatus The following experiments are carried out to ascertain the stability of the amino acids under accelerated simulated acid gas treating conditions. The following reagents are charged into a stainless steel bomb 121 g of N sec. butyl glycine 433 g of KHCO3 540 g of H2O The bomb is put into an oven and heated at 1200C for 1000 hours. Thenthe content is discharged into a 2 liter flask and refluxed for several hours. 750 g of the refluxed material is taken and subjected to an absorption desorption reabsorption cycle as described in Example 11. 27.9 liters of CO2 is absorbed into the regenerated solution, with 10 liters being absorbed in the first minute. Comparison of this result with that obtained with the fresh solution, described in Example 11, shows that the aging process does not lead to a significant loss of activity. If the aging experiment is carried out after replacing N sec. butyl glycine with the equivalent amount of N cyclohexyl glycine, 145 g, and reducing the water to 516 g in order to have the same total weight, a considerable amount of solid, identified as 1,4 bis cyclohexyl 2,5 diketopiperazine is formed. An attempt to carry out an absorption desorption cycle causes plugging of the unit. Aging Under CO2 and H2S The following reagents are charged into a stainless steel bomb 121 g of N sec. butyl glycine 24 g of K2S 390 g of KHCO3 544 g of water The bomb is put into an oven and heated at 120 C for 1000 hours. Then the content is discharged into a 2 liter flask and refluxed for several hours. 765 g of the refluxed material is taken and subjected to an absorption desorption reabsorption cycle as described in Example 11. 28.9 liters of CO2 is absorbed into the regenerated solution, with 10 g being absorbed in the first minute. Comparison of this result with that obtained with the fresh solution, described in Example 11, shows that the aging process leads to only a slight loss of activity. The excellent stability under the aging conditions shown above for the N secondary butyl glycine coupled with its good performance as a promoter, especially in combination with N secondary butyl N methyl glycine, demonstrates the desirability of using this combination of amino acids rather than N cyclohexyl 1,3propanediamine and pipecolinic acid or N cyclohexylglycine.
