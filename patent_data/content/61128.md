Several classes of organic compounds of widely diverse structural types are known to be useful as color formers for carbonless duplicating systems. Among the more important classes are the phenothiazines, for example Nbenzoyl leuco methylene blue fluorans, for example 2 anilino 6 diethylaminofluoran phthalides, for example crystal violet lactone arylsulfinate salts of Michler sHydrol substituted phenylpyridines and various other types of colorless precursors currently employed in commercially accepted carbonless copy systems. Typical of the many such systems are those described in U.S. Patents 2,712,507, 2,800,457, 3,041,289, and 4,000,087.Many of the color formers in the prior art suffer one or more disadvantages such as low tinctorial strength, poor light stability, poor xerographic copiability and low solubility in common organic solvents, the latter disadvantage thus requiring the use of specialized and expensive solvents in order to obtain microencapsulated solutions of sufficient concentration for use in pressure sensitive copy systems. The following appear to constitute the most pertinent prior art relative to the present invention. U.S. Patent 3,985,376 discloses compounds of the formula EMI2.1 in which R1 and R2 are hydrogen or alkyl or aryl of one to eight carbon atoms which may bear alkoxy or halogen as a substituent R3 is hydrogen or alkyl of one to five carbon atoms R4 is alkyl, haloalkyl, cyanalkyl, aryl or aralkyl of one to eight carbon atoms which may bear alkoxy as a substituent R5 and R6 are hydrogen or carbalkoxy of two to five carbon atoms and R3 and R4 may be closed to form a ring.Specific compounds disclosed are those wherein R1 and R2 are each phenyl, R5 and R6 are each hydrogen, R3 is methyl and R4 is is methyl, phenyl or p ethoxyphenyl, and also those wherein R1 and R2 are each E methoxyphenyl, R5 and R6 are each hydrogen and R3 and R4 are each methyl. The compounds are stated to be useful as dye precursors for pressuresensitive recording material. Frank and Seven, J. Amer. Chem. 71, 2629 2635 1949 disclose 4 chlorophenyl 2,6 diphenylpyridine, 4 anisyl 2, 6 diphenylpyridine and 2,6 diphenyl 4 m methoxyphenyl pyridine.

Soc. 74, 200 202 1952 discloses in most pertinent part compounds of the formulaEMI2.2 wherein R is hydrogen, and R is phenyl, 4 methoxyphenyl, 3, 4 methylenedioxyphenyl, 4 dimethylaminophenyl or 2methoxyphenyl. These compounds were isolated as reaction products in a study of the Chichibabin synthesis. E. Koenigs and E. Ruppelt, Ann. 509, 142 158 1934 disclose as basic dyestuffs a number of 4 p dialkylaminophenyl pyridines. Gilman et al., J. Org. Chem. 22, 1169 1171 1957 in most pertinent part disclose 2,6 bis E diethylaminophenyl pyridine as a relatively weak liquid scintillator solute. United Kingdom Patent Application 2,029,591A discloses pyridine derivatives having the formulaEMI3.1 wherein R1 and R2 are independently hydrogen, phenyl group or chlorine substituted phenyl groups R3 is hydrogen, lower alkyl groups or lower alkoxy groups R4 and R5 are independently lower alkyl groups, benzyl group or phenyl group, said lower alkyl groups possibly being substituted with a cyano group, a chlorine atom or a lower alkoxy group. The compounds are stated to produce a yellow color on heating in the presence of an electron acceptor. The present invention provides novel 4 aryl or heteroaryl 2,6 bis heteroaryl or substituted amino phenyl pyridines useful as color formers in pressure sensitive carbonless dupllcating systems and thermal marking systems. The compounds develop light stable colored images of good tinctorial strength, and are soluble in common organic solvents. Moreover, because the compounds produce yellow to orange colors, they are especially valuable as toners used in admixture with other color formers to produce images of a neutral shade. The present invention relates to a compound havingFormula I hereinbelow EMI4.1 wherein Ar is a substituent having the formulaEMI4.2 in which R1 is hydrogen or non tertiary lower alkyl R2 is hydrogen, phenyl or non tertiary lower alkyl R3 is hydrogen, non tertiary lower alkyl or non tertiary lower alkoxy R4 and R5 are the same or different and are lower alkyl or benzyl, or NR4R5 is pyrrolidinyl piperidinyl, or morpholinyl X is O or S Z is 9 julolidinyl or a substituent hiing the formulaEMI4.3 and when Ar isEMI5.1 then Z in addition may be naphthyl or a substituent having the formulaEMI5.2 wherein Y1 and Y2 are the same or different and are selected from hydrogen, lower alkyl, lower alkoxy, halo, nitro, lower alkoxycarbonyl, phenyl or NR9R10 R9 is lower alkyl or benzyl R is lower alkyl, benzyl, cyano lower alkyl or 10 NR9Rlo is pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl or isoindolinyl and when Ar is other thanEMI5.3 then Z in addition may beEMI5.4 wherein R6 is lower alkyl, and R7 is lower alkyl, benzyl, cyano lower alkyl or NR6 R7 is pyrrolidinyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl or isoindolinyl, and R8 is hydrogen, lower alkyl, halo, lower alkoxy, lower alkoxy carbamyl or di lower alkylamino.

The present invention also resides in a process for preparing the compounds of Formula I hereinabove which comprises reacting approximately 2 molar equivalents of a ketone having Formula II hereinbelow Ar COCH3 Formula II with approximately 1 molar equivalent of an aryl or heteroaryl aldehyde having Formula III hereinbelow Z CHO Formula III in the presence of ammonia or an ammonia releasing agent where in Formulas II and III, Ar and Z have the previously given meanings. The invention further resides in a pressuresensitive carbonless duplicating system or thermal marking system containing a support sheet coated with a color forming substance comprising a compound having Formula I hereinabove. A particular embodiment resides in a pressuresensitive transfer sheet adapted for use with a receiving sheet having an electron accepting layer comprising a support sheet coated on one side with a layer of pressure rupturable microcapsules, said microcapsules containing a liquid solution of a color forming substance comprising at least one compound having Formula I. Another particular embodiment resides in a heatresponsive record material comprising a support sheet coated on one side with a layer containing a mixture comprising at least one color forming compound having Formula I and an acidic developer arranged such that application of heat will produce a mark forming reaction between the color forming compound and the acidic developer. A further embodiment resides in a pressuresensitive carbonless duplicating system or a thermal marking system containing a support sheet coated with a color forming substance comprising a compound having Formula I hereinabove in combination with a blue or green and a red or orange color former. Preferred systems within the particular embodiments above described are those having a color forming component of Formula I hereinabove in which R4 and R5 have the previously given meanings and Z is a substituent having the formulaEMI8.1 especially where Y1 and Y2 are the same or different and are hydrogen, lower alkyl or lower alkoxy, or where one of Yi and Y2 is di lower alkylamino and where R4 and R5 are each lower alkyl. Other preferred systems are those having a colorforming component c Formula I hereinabove in which Z is a substituent having e formulaEMI8.2 especially where Rt s hydrogen or halo and R6 and R7 are each lower alkyl, where Ar in Formula I is a substituent having the formulaEMI8.3 and X hating the previously given meanings. As used herein the term halo includes fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. In the terms lower alkyl , cyano lower alkyl , lower alkoxy and lower alkoxycarbonyl , lower denotes a saturated acyclic alkyl moiety having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, secbutyl or isobutyl. The terms isoindolinyl and 9 julolidinyl , of course, refer respectively to the radicals having the formulasEMI9.1 In accordance with the process of this invention the compounds having Formula I hereinabove are obtained by reacting approximately two molar equivalents of a ketone of Formula II hereinabove with approximately one molar equivalent of an aryl or heteroaryl aldehyde of Formula III hereinabove in the presence of ammonia or an ammoniareleasing agent. Thus, the ketone and aldehyde can be condensed in the presence of aqueous or alcoholic ammonia or alternatively, and preferably, in the presence of an ammonia releasing agent such as ammonium acetate in acetic acid. The reactants are heated at about 50 1500C. for approximately 1 to 5 hours, usually at the reflux temperature of the solvent for about 2 hours.The product thus obtained can be isolated by filtration if it is insoluble in the reaction medium, or by dilution of the reaction medium with a miscible solvent in which the product is insoluble such as water or a lower alkanol, for example, isopropyl alcohol, or a mixture of these in order to effect precipitation of the product. Alternatively, the reaction mixture can be poured into water or dilute ammonium hydroxide and the product extracted with an organic solvent such as benzene toluene or chloroform followed by evaporation of the organic solvent leaving the product as a residue. Frequently the product begins to separate from the reaction mixture as an oil. Usually the addition of a lower alkanol such as ethanol or isopropyl alcohol to the hot reaction will induce the product to separate in crystalline form on cooling.The product once isolated can be purified by conventional means such as trituration or recrystallization from a suitable solvent. The ketones of Formula II and the aldehydes ofFormula III which are required as starting materials in the preparation of the final products of Formula I are generally known and are either commercially available or readily obtained by conventional procedures well known in the art.Those ketones and aldehydes which are specifically novel can be prepared in accordance with the procedures described for preparation of the known compounds. The novel compounds of Formula I hereinabove are pale yellow to colorless in the depicted form. When contacted with an acidic medium, for example silica gel, or one of the types ordinarily employed in pressure sensitive carbonless duplicating systems such as silton clay or phenolic resins, the compounds of Formula I develop an intense yellow to orange image which is xerographically copiable and light stable. The compounds are thus highly suitable for use as color precursors, that is, color forming substances in pressure sensitive carbonless duplicating systems. Becau they produce a yellow to orange color, these compounds ar especially valuable as toners which are used in admixture with other color formers to produce images of a neutral shade which desirably possess excellent xerographic copiability. Thus, a yellow to orange color former of FormulI hereinabove can be combined with a red or orange color former and a blue or green color former to afford a colorforming substance which produces a neutral or black image. The compounds of this invention may be incorporated in any of the commercially accepted systems known in the carbonless duplicating art. A typical technique for such application is as follows solutions containing one or more color precursor compounds of Formula I, optionally in admixture with other color formers as noted above, in suitable solvents are microencapsulated by well known procedures, for example as described in U.S. Patents 3,649,649, 3,429,827 and 4,000,087. The microcapsules are coated on the reverse side of a transfer sheet with the aid of a suitable binder and the coated transfer sheet is then assembled in a manifold with the microcapsule coated side in contact with a receiving sheet coated with an electron accepting substance for example silton clay or phenolic resin.Application of pressure to the manifold such as that exerted by a stylus, typewriter or other form of writing or printing c auses the capsules on the reverse side to rupture. The solution of the color former released from the ruptured microcapsules.flows to the receiving sheet and on contact with the acidic medium thereon forms a colored image. It is, of course, obvious that variants of this mode of application can be utilized. For example, the receiving sheet in a manifold can alternatively be coated with the subject compounds and the acidic developing agent can be contained in microcapsules applied on the reverse side of the top sheet in the manifold or the receiving sheet can be coated with a mixture containing both the acidic developing agent and the microencapsulated color former. It has also been found that when the compounds ofFormula I are intimately mixed with an acidic developer of the type generally employed in thermal papers such as described in U.S. Patents 3,539,375 and 3,447,944, that is, papers which produce a colored image when contacted with a heated stylus or heated type, for example, bisphenol A, heating of the mixture produces a colored image of varying shades from yellow to orange depending on the particular compound of the invention employed. As noted above, darker shades can be produced by mixing the compounds of Formula I with other color formers.The ability of the compounds ofFormula I to form an intense color when heated in admixture with an acidic developer such as bisphenol A makes them useful in thermal paper marking systems either where an original or duplicate copy is prepared by contacting the thermal paper with a heated stylus or heated type in any of the methods generally known in the art.
