## Description
This invention relates to an improved, high yield synthesis of higher polyol fatty acid polyesters, sucrose polyesters in particular, via transesterification. The food and pharmaceutical industries have recently focused attention on polyol polyesters for use as low calorie fats in food products and as pharmaceutical agents, e.g., for the lowering of blood cholesterol levels. U.S. Patent 3,600,186, Mattson and Volpenhein, issued August 17, 1971, describes low calorie food compositions formed by replacing at least a portion of the fat content of food products with higher polyol fatty acid polyesters. U.S. Patent 3,954,976, Mattson and Volpenhein, issued May 4, 1976, describes pharmaceutical compositions for inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol comprising effective unit dosage amounts of higher polyol fatty acid polyesters, as well as the method for treating hypercholesterolemia using these polyesters. Additional pharmaceutical uses are described in U.S. Patent 4,241,054, Volpenhein and Jandacek, issued December 23, 1980 removal of halogenated toxins from the body , and U.S. Patent 4,264,583, Jandacek, April 28, 1981 treatment of gallstones . As a result of these many uses for the higher polyol fatty acid polyesters, it would be desirable to have an efficient high yield synthesis for them. Historically, such syntheses have been conducted using a mutual solvent to solubilize a polyol and esters of long chain fatty acids, thus providing a homogeneous reaction medium suitable for catalytic transesterification. One variation of this process, known as the Snell synthesis, has been employed as a means for preparing both poly and lower esters. However, the solvents employed in such processes are difficult to separate from the final product and are characteristically toxic, therefore limiting the usefulness of such syntheses in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Accordingly, efforts have been directed toward the discovery of high yield syntheses of polyol fatty acid polyesters which do not employ toxic solvents. U.S. Patent 3,963,699, Rizzi and Taylor, issued June 15, 1976, describes the basic solvent free transesterification process for synthesizing higher polyol fatty acid polyesters. In this three step reaction, a mixture of a polyol such as sucrose , a fatty acid lower alkyl ester such as fatty acid methyl ester , an alkali metal fatty acid soap, and a basic catalyst is heated, forming a homogeneous melt, to which is added excess fatty acid lower alkyl ester to form the higher polyol fatty acid polyesters. The polyesters are then separated from the reaction mixture. The catalysts described in this patent as being useful include alkali metals, alloys of two or more alkali metals, alkali metal hydrides, and alkali metal alkoxides. The processes exemplified in this patent utilize sodium hydride, sodium hydroxide or dispersions of potassium as catalysts, and soap sucrose mole ratios of about 0.3 0.4 1. Rizzi and Taylor, U.S. Patent 4,334,061, Brossier, III, issued June 8, 1982, describes a method for separating and purifying the polyesters formed by the Rizzi and Taylor process. The procedure requires, in the separation step, an alkaline pH which is obtained by adding an alkali metal carbonate to the reaction mixture at the conclusion of the transesterification reaction. Thus, the carbonate compounds added do not function as catalysts for the transesterfication reaction. U.S. Patent 2,893,990, Hass, et al, issued July 7, 1959, describes a process for making carboxylic acid lower esters of sucrose and raffinose generally, mono or diesters are formed. In the process, a non sucrose ester of a fatty acid e.g., methyl stearate or methyl palmitate is reacted with sucrose, preferably in a solvent. A wide range of alkaline catalysts, including sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, are disclosed for use in the reaction. GB A 2081266 discloses the use of alkali metal carbonates in the production of lower sucrose polyesters, viz. mono, di and triesters of sucrose. In the disclosed process, molar ratios of lower alkyl ester to sucrose of αµρ 1 1 are produced in the reaction mixture. GB A 2065634 also discloses the production of lower sucrose polyesters as surfactants in a non solvent system using a basic interesterification catalyst but includes mixed glycerides of a fatty acid of 8 carbon atoms in the reaction mixture. The interesterification catalyst can be any of the normal types, It has now been found that by modifying the solvent free transesterfication reaction described in the Rizzi and Taylor patent, discussed above, using potassium carbonate as the catalyst and using significantly higher soap sucrose mole ratios than those originally envisioned, shorter reaction times, more complete utilization of the polyol component, and improved yields of the higher polyol polyesters can be obtained. It is, therefore, an object of this invention to provide an improved solvent free high yield synthesis of polyol fatty acid polyesters. According to the present invention there is provided a solvent free transesterification process for synthesizing sucrose octa esters in yields of 75 based on the weight of sucrose starting material comprising the steps of In a preferred embodiment, the molar ratio of soap sucrose in step 1 is from 0.75 1 to 1 1, more preferably from 0.75 1 to 0.85 1, most preferably 0.75 1. The present invention encompasses improvements in the solvent free transesterification reaction for forming higher polyol fatty acid polyesters described and claimed in US Patent 3,963,699, Rizzi and Taylor, issued June 15, 1976. This process is characterized by a three step reaction procedure, summarized below. By utilizing the improvements taught herein, the reaction described in the Rizzi and Taylor patent can be improved by reducing the excessive foaming, shortening reaction times, increasing the yields of the higher polyol fatty acid polyesters, and yielding products having better lighter color characteristics. In fact, the improvements herein permit the reaction to be formulated as a single step solvent free reaction for the production of higher polyol fatty acid polyesters. In the first step of the present process, a heterogeneous mixture of sucrose, fatty acid methyl, 2 methoxy ethyl or benzyl esters, an alkali metal fatty acid soap, and potassium carbonate as a basic catalyst is reacted to form a homogeneous melt comprising partially esterified sucrose and unreacted starting materials. As used herein, the term fatty acid esters is intended to include the methyl, 2 methoxy ethyl and benzyl esters of fatty acids containing eight or more carbon atoms, and mixtures of such esters, prepared by the reaction of diazoalkanes with, or derived by alcoholysis from, the fatty acids naturally occurring in fats and oils. Suitable fatty acid esters can be derived from either saturated or unsaturated fatty acids. Suitable preferred saturated fatty acids include, for example, capric, lauric, palmitic, stearic, behenic, isomyristic, isomargaric, myristic, caprylic, and anteisoarachadic. Suitable preferred unsaturated fatty acids include, for example, maleic, linoleic, licanic, oleic, linolenic, and erythrogenic acids. Mixtures of fatty acids derived from soybean oil, palm oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, and corn oil are especially preferred for use herein. Methyl esters are the preferred fatty acid esters for use herein, since their use in the process herein tends to result in unusually high yields of polyol fatty acid polyesters. As used herein, the term alkali metal fatty acid soap is intended to include the alkali metal salts of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids having from eight to eighteen carbon atoms. Accordingly, suitable alkali metal fatty acid soaps include, for example, the lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, and cesium salts of fatty acids such as capric, lauric, myristic, palmitic, licanic, parinaric, and stearic acids, as well as mixtures thereof. Mixtures of fatty acids derived from soybean oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, and corn oil are preferred for use herein. Accordingly, preferred alkali metal fatty acid soaps include, for example, the potassium soap made from soybean oil fatty acids and the sodium soap made from sunflower oil fatty acids. In the present invention, the basic catalyst used in the reaction is potassium carbonate. It has been found that when this specific compound is used as the catalyst, shorter reaction times and or increased yields of the higher polyol polyesters are obtained when compared to essentially identical reactions carried out using more conventional catalysts, such as sodium hydride, potassium hydride, soap, or sodium methoxide. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the catalyst is dispersed in a suitable carrier so as to insure uniform distribution of the catalyst throughout the reaction mass. Suitable carriers or dispersing agents include, for example, methanol and fatty acid methyl esters. In carrying out step 1, the above described reactants are combined to form a heterogeneous mixture. The precise ratio of reactants can be freely selected from within the guidelines set forth hereinafter. However, routine experimentation may be necessary in order to establish the optimum concentrations for a given set of reactants. In general, the heterogeneous mixture comprises from 10 to 50 , preferably from 15 to 30 , by weight of the sucrose from 40 to 80 , preferably from 55 to 75 , by weight of the fatty acid esters from 1 to 30 , preferably from 5 to 20 , by weight of the alkali metal fatty acid soap and from 0.05 to 5 , preferably from 0.1 to 0.5 , by weight of the basic catalyst component. It has surprisingly been found that when this mixture is formed so as to include relatively high molar ratios of soap polyol, increased yields of the higher polyesters e.g., the octaesters are obtained when compared with similar reactions carried out using lower art disclosed soap polyol molar ratios e.g., 0.3 0.4 1 . Specifically, these higher soap polyol ratios result in increased yields of the higher polyols, more complete utilization of the polyol reaction component, and or faster disappearance of free polyol from the reaction mixture. Soap polyol molar ratios in step 1 of from 0.6 1 to 1 1 are, therefore, used in the present invention. More preferred soap polyol ratios fall in the range from 0.75 1 to 1 1, from 0.75 1 to 0.85 1, and most preferably 0.75 1. The use of these high soap polyol molar ratios in combination with basic catalysts other than potassium carbonate is further disclosed and claimed in commonly assigned EP A 0132293. The heterogeneous mixture is heated to a temperature within the range of from 110 C to 180 C, preferably from 130 C to 145 C, under a pressure of from 13.3 Pa 0.1 mm Hg to 101325 Pa 760 mm Hg , preferably from 66.5 Pa 0.5 mm Hg to 3325 Pa 25 mm Hg . Within these temperature and pressure ranges, a homogeneous melt of partially esterified polyol and unreacted starting materials will form in from 1 to 4 hours. It may be desirable to initiate the reaction by initially introducing from 0.1 to 1 by weight of catalyst and thereafter introducing additional catalyst as the reaction proceeds. In the second step of the instant process, excess fatty acid methyl, 2 methoxy ethyl, or benzyl esters are added to the homogeneous melt formed in step 1. As used herein, the term excess is intended to include sufficient fatty acid esters to raise the overall ester polyol mole ratio above 8 1, preferably to 12 1. Although ratios beyond 12 1 can be used, as a general rule, such ratios do not noticeably decrease reaction time or improve the yield and, therefore, tend to be impractical. When fatty acid methyl esters are used, it is preferred that after the excess ester is added to the reaction mixture, the mixture be heated to a temperature of from 120 C to 160 C, preferably 135 C, at a pressure from 13.3Pa 0.1 mm Hg to 1330 Pa 10 mm Hg , preferably from 66.5Pa 0.5 mm Hg to 266 Pa 2 mm Hg , to form the sucrose fatty acid polyester material. The reaction time for step 2 is preferably less than 10 hours, and generally is between 2 and 8 hours. It should be noted that as the transesterification reaction proceeds, a lower alcohol is formed as a by product. In order to promote the reaction, the alcohol by product is preferably removed. Many removal techniques are known in the art, any one of which can be used to effectively and efficiently remove the lower alcohol. Vacuum removal both with and without an inert gas sparging has been found to promote the reaction. In any event, the formation of a lower alcohol presents no significant obstacle to the use of the process in the food or pharmaceutical industries. The use of the catalysts and soap polyol ratios, defined herein, permit the combination of steps 1 and 2 into a single reaction step. In this single step approach, a mixture of a sucrose b an alkali metal fatty acid soap c a basic catalyst comprising potassium carbonate and d an excess of fatty acid methyl, 2 methoxy ethyl or benzyl ester wherein the soap sucrose molar ratio is from 0.6 1 to 1 1, preferably from 0.75 1 to 1 1, more preferably from 0.75 1 to 0.85 1, most preferably 0.75 1 , is heated to a temperature of from 100 C to 180 C at a pressure of from 13.3Pa 0.1mm Hg 101325Pa 760 mm of mercury , thereby forming higher sucrose fatty acid polyesters. In the third step of the process, the sucrose fatty acid polyesters formed in step 2 are separated from the reaction mix containing polyesters, soap, and unreacted starting materials. Separation can be accomplished by any of the separation procedures routinely used in the art. Distillation, water washing, conventional refining techniques or solvent extraction are preferred due to their simplicity and economy. The following non limiting examples are intended to further clarify the invention, but should not be construed as limiting thereof. Each of the following reactions was carried out in a 1 liter 3 neck flask containing a stirrer, thermometer, reflux condensor, and vacuum outlet. The reaction was cooled to 90 100 C and 200 ml 80 20 2 by weight water alcohol salt added and the mix stirred for 10 minutes at 80 C. The reaction mix was transferred to a separatory funnel and the phases allowed to separate. The lower aqueous soap solution was discarded and the lipid phase returned to the reactor for additional washes first with a second 80 20 2 water alcohol salt wash and then with 2 aqueous acetic acid and two water washes all at 80 C . The lipid was dried under vacuum, bleached with 1 5 Filtrol 105 a bleaching earth , filtered and steam deodorized at 205 C to remove excess FAME. The sample was weighed and the yield calculated as percent sucrose recovered as octaester. The octaester content of the reaction product was determined by separating the mix on a silica gel column and weighing the relative amount of octaester and partial esters recovered. The product formed comprised a mixture of the higher polyesters of sucrose, having a high octaester content. Substantially similar results are obtained when the FAME is replaced, in whole or in part, with soybean oil benzyl esters, soybean oil 2 methoxy ethyl esters or the methyl esters of palm oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, or corn oil. Similar results are also obtained when the potassium soybean oil fatty acid soaps used in the above example are replaced, in whole or in part, by the lithium, sodium, rubidium or cesium salts of fatty acids derived from sunflower oil, safflower oil or corn oil. The general procedure described in Example I was used to compare the effectiveness of potassium carbonate K₂CO₃ with other basic catalysts not in accordance with the invention, viz. sodium carbonate Na₂CO₃ , sodium methoxide NaOMe , sodium hydride Na.H and potassium hydroxide KOH , all at 10 mole percent of the sucrose in the reaction. K₂CO₃ was also compared with NaOMe, and potassium hydride K.H at four weight percent of the sucrose. The results are summarized in the table below. To assess the effect of soap level on the reaction, the reaction as described in Example I was utilized. The concentration of soap in the reaction mix was controlled by either varying the amount of KOH added at the beginning or by adding varying amounts of preformed potassium soaps. Two analytical methods were used to monitor the effect of soap on the reaction. In the first, varying amounts of KOH and radiolabelled sucrose were used. At the end of the first two hours, before the second addition of FAME, the reaction was stopped and partitioned between hot water and ethyl acetate. The amount of ¹⁴C activity found in the water relative to that added as free sucrose at the beginning of the reaction was a measure of unreacted sucrose. These results are summarized below. In the second test, varying amounts of preformed potassium soap were added to the mixture in place of KOH. The effect of the soap was judged by measuring yield of sucrose polyesters and octaester content. The results obtained are as follows.
