# Improvements in or relating to radiation level detectors.

## Abstract
The free surface of fluid 9 e.g molten steel dense to particular ionising radiations and contained within a vessel 2 e.g. a casting mould is monitored by a device which includes a radio active source 1 positioned on one side of the vessel 2 and a detector 4 positioned on the other side which includes a photo muliplier 13 having a photo ca thode coupled to a phosphor scintillator 12 of sufficient lenght to cover the predicted range of movement of the liquid free surface.
