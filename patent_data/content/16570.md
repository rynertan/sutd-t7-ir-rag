# Tire building machine.

## Abstract
A tire building machine of the expandable bead lock type employs an elastomeric specially shaped radially expanding bead lock 43 including a shaping and turning bladder 48 which includes an air passage system therethrough. The elas tomeric bead lock is confined for radial expansion in an annu lar outwardly opening chamber 114 in the form of an isos celes trapezoid in radial section with the elastomeric bead lock being of similar configuration and expanded by direct applica tion of air pressure within the chamber. The configuration of the annular chamber and the bead lock compensate for stretching of the bead lock upon enlargement. The edges of the bead lock at the axial sides of the chamber are undercut for flexibility while the walls 70, 71 of the chamber are specially coated to maintain the seal. The bead lock incorporates inter connected metallic segment side plates 76, 77 which not only limit the stroke of the moving seal but insure stability axially of the bead and provide the desired concentricity. The bladder is pressurized through an annular air passage system and sealed conduit 137 extending radially through the pres sure chamber inside the bead lock.
