## Description
IMPROVED ALKENYL AROMATIC OLEFINICALLY UNSATURATED ACID FOAMS AND PROCESS FOR PREPARATION Extruded plastic foams have become important items of commerce utilized as thermal insulation and decoration. One of the more popular extruded plastic foams is polystyrene foam. It has been recognized that it would be desirable to have improved styrene polymer foam having a higher heat distortion temperature, greater solvent resistance and having a wider latitude in preparation. Extruded alkenyl aromatic polymer foams generally are prepared using substantial quantities of halocarbons as volatile fluid foaming agents.Depending on the particular volatile fluid foaming agent or mixture employed, the halocarbon will sooner or later diffuse from the foam and enter the atmosphere.There has been considerable semiscientific speculation as to the long term effects of such halogens being released into the atmosphere. In view of the current energy crisis, larger and larger volumes of extruded plastic foam and thermal insulation will be desired and required. One convenient solution to the halo hydrocarbon problem would be to employ carbon dioxide as a blowing agent. However, certain technical drawbacks exist which make the use of carbon dioxide as a blowing agent undesirable. It would be desirable if there were available an improved alkenyl aromatic polymer foam suitable for thermal insulation and decoration. It would be desirable if there were available an improved process for the preparation of alkenyl aromatic polymer foams which minimized the amount of halo hydrocarbons released into the atmosphere. It would also be desirable if there were available an improved process for the preparation of alkenyl aromatic polymer foams which permitted an increase in latitude in the operating conditions. These benefits and other advantages in accordance with the present invention are achieved in an improved alkenyl aromatic polymer foam, the foam having a density of from 0.5 to 8 lb ft3 8 128 kg m3 , the foam having a synthetic resinous thermoplastic body comprised of a polymer having a weight average molecular weight of from about 100,000 to about 350,000 gram moles, the polymer having polymerized therein from abput 99 to 70 parts by weight of an alkenyl aromatic monomer and from about 1 to 30 parts by weight of an olefinically unsaturated acid selected from the group consisting of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, itaconic acid and mixtures thereof, the body defining a plurality of closed gas filled cells, the foam body having an ion therein, the ion being selected from a group consisting of sodium, magnesium, zinc, ammonium and mixtures thereof. Synthetic resinous thermoplastic foams suitable for the practice of the present invention are polymers containing polymers thereof alkenyl aromatic monomer and olefinically unsaturated acid wherein the alkenyl aromatic monomer is present in the proportion of from about 99 to 70 parts by weight and the acid is present in a proportion of from about 1 to 30 parts by weight. Preferable for most applications, the alkenyl aromatic monomer is present in a proportion of from about 95 parts by weight to 80 parts by weight while the acid is present in a proportion of from about 5 to 20 parts by weight. Advantageously, the weight average molecular weight of the alkenyl aromatic monomer and olefinically unsaturated acid containing polymer is from about 100,000 to 350,000 gram moles as determined by gel permeation chromatography, and preferably from about 150,000 to 300,000 gram moles. By the term alkenyl aromatic monomer is meant an alkenyl aromatic compound having the general formulaEMI3.1 wherein Ar represents an aromatic hydrocarbon radical, or an aromatic halohydrocarbon radical of the benzene series, and R is hydrogen or the methyl radical. Examples of such alkenyl aromatic monomers are styrene, a methylstyrene, o methylstyrene, m methylstyrene, p methylstyrene, ar ethylstyrene, ar vinylxylene, ar chlorostyrene or ar bromostyrene and the like. In the preparation of foams in accordance with the present invention, the copolymers employed need not be limited only to two monomers such as styrene and acrylic acid. A portion of the styrene may readily be replaced with alkyl styrenes such as methylstyrene, t butylstyrene, bromostyrene, chlorostyrene and the like as well as acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, methylmethacrylate in a proportion generally up to about 20 weight percent of the total polymer. The acrylic acid portion may be wholly or partially replaced with methacrylic acid, itaconic acid and the like. Blowing agents useful in the practice of the present invention include sodium bicarbonate, magnesium carbonate, ammonium carbonate, and zinc carbonate in a proportion of 0.5 to 20 parts by weight per hundred parts by weight of polymer, and combinations of sodium bicarbonate with sodium methoxide with hydrocarbons or fluorocarbons. Also useful in the practice of the present invention are sodium carbonate monohydrate, zinc acetate dihydrate, zinc carbonate, ammonium carbonate, magnesium carbonate hydrates including basic magnesium carbonates.Such foaming agents again may be used alone or in combination with hydrocarbons or fluorocarbons. Suitable volatile fluid foaming agents are well known in the art. Desirably the density of the foam in accordance with the invention is from about 0.5 to about 8 pounds per cubic foot and preferably in the range of about 1 to 5 pounds per cubic foot. Desirably the cell size of the foam is from about 0.1 to about 5 millimeters and advantageously from about 0.1 to about 2.5 millimeters. Suitable styrene acrylic acid copolymers for the practice of the present invention are provided by a coil polymerization technique set forth in U.S. LettersPatent 3,035,033 to W. K. Schweitzer. A like procedure can be used to prepare other copolymers for the practice of the present invention. Generally, preparation of foam in accordance with the present invention is accomplished by intimately admixing particulate resin with the desired particulate blowing agent, for example a styrene acrylic acid resin having a particle diameter of about 0.1 inch 0.25 cm and powdered sodium bicarbonate. In order to provide uniform admixture it is often desirable to apply to the resin an adhering aid such as a 1 1 by weight mixture of dibutylphthalate and alphamethylstyrene. Usually, the particulate resin if the resin is placed into a suitable dry blender, the adhering aid added, the material tumbled for a length of time generally known only to those familiar with the particular dry blender, the powdered foaming agent such as sodium bicarbonate and then the added mixture further tumbled to provide a dispersion of sodium bicarbonate over a surface of the resin and because of the presence of the adhered aid, stratification of the resin of sodium bicarbonate does not occur under normal handling conditions. The dry blend of resin and foaming agent is then passed to an extruder where it is heat plastified, usually at a temperature of about 2500C, thoroughly mixed, cooled and extruded into a zone of lower pressure where it foams and cools to a self supporting shape. Generally, it is desirable to maintain the heat plastified foaming agent containing resinous composition under sufficient pressure that foaming is prevented until the heated mobile gel is exposed to atmospheric pressure. The preparation of foams such as foam plank is well known and is set forth in the followingU.S. Letters Patents 2,669,751 2,740,157 2,838,801 3,751,377 3,817,669 3,954,929 3,897,528 and 3,914,085 the preparation of foamed sheet by extrusion is disclosed in the following U.S. Letters Patent 2,917,217 3,151,192 3,648,462 3,311,681 3,391,051 3,560,600.All molecular weights are determined by gel permeation chromatography. The invention is further illustrated but not limited by the following examples. Employing a 3 4 inch 1.91 cm extruder having a feed zone heated to a temperature of about 2100C, an intermediate zone heated to about 1800C, and a die heated to about 1500C, a first series of foam samples were produced utilizing a styrene acrylic acid copolymer containing 8.0 weight percent acrylic acid and having a molecular weight of about 260,000 gram moles varying quantities of sodium bicarbonate were employed as blowing agent and varying screw speeds were utilized. A second series of samples were prepared using styrene acrylic acid copolymer of about 8 weight percent acrylic acid, the remainder styrene and having a molecular weight of 210,000 gram moles. Die temperature, die pressure and screw speed were recorded foam samples were gathered, aged in air for a period of about a week and the external skin removed prior to determining the foam density which is recorded in pounds per cubic foot. Cell size was measured using the procedure ASTMD 3576 and the percentage of open cells was determined by ASTM D 2856 A and the heat distortion temperature was determined by modified ASTM Test D 2126 75. This test employs a one hour exposure at each temperature and the heat distortion temperature is the maximum temperature giving a linear dimension change of less than two percent.The results are set forth in Table I wherein the following abbreviations are employed SAA Styrene acrylic acid copolymer pph parts by weight per hundred parts of polymer OC degrees Centigrade rpm revolutions per minute pcf pounds per cubic foot mm millimeters Temp.

On the other hand, polystyrene is not expanded to a low density foam by sodium bicarbonate and the polystyrene foam has a high open cell content over the entire range of sodium bicarbonate level. A styrene maleic anhydride copolymer containing about 20 percent maleic anhydride polymerized therein, with a solution viscosity of 5.6 centipoise at 250C in a 10 percent methylethylketone solution was foamed employing sodium bicarbonate as well as a styrene acrylonitrile polymer which contained about 75 weight percent styrene with 25 weight percent acrylonitrile were foamed for comparative purposes. The styrene maleic anhydride copolymer being designated by the abbreviations SMA and styrene acrylonitrile polymer, by SAN. These styrene copolymers do not produce a low density closed cell foam as shown in Table III. From the results, it appears that the response of the styrene acrylic acid copolymer to the sodium bicarbonate blowing agent is unique.

The die diameter was 1 1 4 inches and the die gap was 0.025 inch. The blowing agent used was varying amounts of sodium bicarbonate. The copolymer employed was of styrene and acrylic acid which contained about 8 weight percent acrylic acid, the remainder being styrene. The polymer was extruded at about nine pounds per hour. The screw speed and temperatures were adjusted for optimum results. The results are set forth in Table XI.

Employing the apparatus of the previous illustration, foam was prepared from a copolymer of 92 weight percent vinyl toluene and 8 weight percent acrylic acid. The vinyl toluene was about 60 weight percent meta isomer and 40 weight percent para isomer.The polymer had a molecular weight of about 180,000 gram moles 7 parts by weight of sodium bicarbonate were employed as blowing agent to 100 parts by weight of the resin. The die temperature was 1500C, screw speed was 30 revolutions per minute. The resultant foam had a density of 4.54 pounds per cubic foot the cell size was about 0.45 millimeters and was 21.2 percent open cell. For a comparison, a homopolymer of paravinyl toluene having a molecular weight of about 300,000 gram moles was similarly treated. The foam with skin had a density of 6.11 pounds per cubic foot cell size of 0.62 millimeters, and was 37.8 percent open cell. In a manner similar to the foregoing illustrations, other foams are readily prepared employing sodium bicarbonate, hydrated magnesium carbonate, zinc diacetate monohydrate alone or in combination with a volatile fluid foaming agent to prepare foam plank or foam sheet when the hereinbefore described styrene acrylic acid, styrene methacrylic acid or styrene itaconic acid vinyl toluene acrylic acid copolymers are utilized.
