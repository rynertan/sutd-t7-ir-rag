## Description
The present invention relates to water soluble synthetic glycosides of vitamin D, and their use in the regulation of calcium metabolism. Vitamin D₃ deficiency, or disturbances in the metabolism of vitamin D₃ cause such diseases as ricketts, renal osteodystrophy and related bone diseases, as well as, generally, hypo and hyper calcemic states. vitamin D₃ and its metabolites are therefore crucial in maintaining normal development of bone structure by regulating blood calcium levels. vitamin D₃ is rapidly converted to 25 OH D₃ in the liver. In response to hypocalcemia, 25 OH D₃, the major circulating metabolite of the vitamin, undergoes further metabolism in the kidney to 1α, 25 OH ₂D₃. 1α, 25 OH ₂D₃ acts more rapidly than either D₃ or 25 OH D₃. Additionally, the dihydroxy form of the vitamin is 5 10 times more potent than D₃ and about 2 5 times more potent than the monohydroxy form of the vitamin, vitamin D₂, vitamin D₃ or their metabolites which are hydroxylated at positions 1 1, 25 1,24, 25 24,25 25,26 or 1,25,26 are water insoluble compounds. When a drug is relatively insoluble in a aqueous environment or in the gastrointestinal lumen, post administration dissolution may become the rate limiting step in drug absorption. On the other hand, with water soluble drugs, dissolution occurs rapidly and thus facilitates transport through the blood and to the site of activity. It would therefore be desirable to provide a form of vitamin D D₃ or D₂ which is hydrophilic and or water soluble, yet preserves the normal biological properties of the water insoluble drug. The extracts from the leaves of a South American plant, A very similar water soluble principle, which upon treatment with glycosidases also yields 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D₃, is found in the plant The only evidence existing to date concerning the structure of the water soluble fragment released during glycosidase treatment of the water soluble principles from these plants is indefinite. The authors of the aforementioned publications have concluded that the structure is probably a glycoside, on the basis of enzymatic evidence, the water solubility, and the use of chemical detection reagents Peterlik, N. and Wasserman, R.H. FEBS Lett. Since it is known that the molecular weight of the water soluble vitamin D₃ containing principle, prior to enzymatic release, is considerably greater than 1000 Humphreys, D.J., Nature London New Biology Moreover, the results of enzymatic release are fully consistent with a wide variety of structures. For example, Haussler, M.R., In sum, the results observed by these authors are consistent with a wide range of structures, none of which have been well characterized but which, even if proven to be glycosides, contain at least more than 3 glycosidic units per vitamin D unit. A need, therefore, continues to exist for a well defined, well characterized water soluble form of vitamin D, which will be hypocalcemically active and maintain calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide well characterized, well defined synthetic, water soluble forms of vitamin D₃, vitamin D₂, and hydroxylated metabolites thereof. It is another object of the invention to provide water soluble forms of the aforementioned vitamins D which are hypocalcemically active, and which are active in maintaining calcium and phosphorous homeostasis in the animal body. Still another object of the invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition containing the aforementioned vitamins. These and other objects of the invention, as will hereinafter become more readily apparent, have been attained by providing A synthetic compound which is biologically active in maintaining calcium and phosphorous homeostasis in animals, of the formula I wherein the bond between carbons C 22 and C 23 is single or double R² is hydrogen, CH₃ or CH₂CH₃ The present invention provides for the first time well defined and substantially pure characterized synthetic, water soluble forms of vitamins D₃ and D₂, as well as hydroxylated derivatives of these vitamins. The compounds of the present invention may in many instances be crystalline. They represent a distinct advance over the partially purified, poorly characterized presumed glycoside of 1α, 25 dihydroxy vitamin D₃ of the prior art. By glycosidic units are meant glycopyranosyl or glycofuranosyl, as well as their amino sugar derivatives. The residues may be homopolymers, random, or alternating or block copolymers thereof. The glycosidic units have free hydroxy groups, or hydroxy groups acylated with a group wherein R³ is hydrogen, lower alkyl, aryl or aralkyl. Preferably R³ is C₁ C₆ alkyl, most preferably acetyl or propionyl, phenyl, nitrophenyl, halophenyl, lower alkyl substituted phenyl, lower alkoxy substituted phenyl and the like or benzyl, nitrobenzyl, halobenzyl, lower alkyl substituted benzyl and lower alkoxy substituted benzyl When the compounds of formula I have a double bond at position C 22, they are derivatives of vitamin D₂, whereas if the bond at that position is single, and there is a lack of C₂₄ alkyl they are derivatives of vitamin D₃. The latter are preferred. The compounds of the invention contain at least one glycosidic residue at positions 1, 3, 24, 25 or 26. They may, however contain more than one, and up to five such glycosidic residues simultaneously. Preferred are those compounds derived from vitamins D₃ or D₂ 1 hydroxy vitamins D₃ or D₂ 1,25 dihydroxy vitamins D₃ or D₂ 25 dihydroxy vitamins D₃ or D₂ 25,26 dihydroxy vitamins D₃ or D₂ 1,24,25 trihydroxy vitamins D₃ or D₂ and 1,25,26 trihydroxy vitamins D₃ or D₂. Most preferred among these are vitamins D₃ or D₂ 1 hydroxy vitamins D₃ or D₂ and 1 25 dihydroxy vitamins D₃ or D₂. In the case of multihydroxylated forms of the vitamins e.g., 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D₃ has three hydroxy groups, at positions 1, 3, and 25 , the preferred compounds of the invention are those wherein less than all of the multiple hydroxy groups are glycosilated, most preferably those where only one of the multiple hydroxy groups is glycosilated. The glycosides can comprise up to 20 glycosidic units. Preferred, however, are those having less than 10, mose preferred, those having 3 or less than 3 glycosidic units. Specific examples are those containing 1 or 2 glycosidic units in the glycoside residue. The glycopyranose or glycofuranose rings or amino derivatives thereof may be fully or partially acylated or completely deacylated. The completely or partially acylated glycosides are useful as defined intermediates for the synthesis of the deacylated materials. Among the possible glycopyranosyl structures are glucose, mannose, galactose, gulose, allose, altrose, idose, or talose. Among the furanosyl structures, the preferred ones are those derived from fructose, arabinose, cellobiose, maltose, lactose, trehalose, gentiobiose, and melibiose. Among the triglycosides, the preferred ones are those derived from fructose, arabinose or xylose. Among preferred diglycosides are sucrose, cellobiose, maltose, lactose, trehalose, gentiobiose, and melibiose. Among the triglycosides, the preferred ones may be raffinose or gentianose. Among the amino derivatives are N acetyl D galactosamine, N acetyl D glucosamine, N acetyl D mannosamine, N acetylneuraminic acid, D glucosamine, lyxosylamine and D galactosamine. When more than one glycosidic unit is present on a single hydroxy group i.e., di or polyglycosidic residues , the individual glycosidic rings may be bonded by 1 1, 1 2, 1 3, 1 4, 1 5, or 1 6 bonds, most preferably 1 2, 1 4, and 1 6. The linkages between individual glycosidic rings may be α or β. The configuration of the oxygen linkage of a hydroxy group, or glycosidic residue attached to the vitamin D₃ or D₂ molecule may be either α out of the plane of the paper or β into the plane of the paper . It is preferred if the configuration of the 3 hydroxy or glycosidoxy group at C 3 be β , and that, independently or simultaneously the configuration of the hydroxy or glycosidoxy at C 1 be α . It is also preferred that the configuration around C 24 be Specific Examples of compounds of the invention are All of the aforementioned derivatives can also be prepared with vitamin D₂. The glycosidic derivatives of vitamins D of the present invention can be prepared by standard synthetic methods well known to those skilled in the art. These methods depend on whether the starting vitamin D₃ or vitamin D₂ contains one or more hydroxy groups. When the vitamin contains only one hydroxy group, the syntheses are straightforward, since the monohydroxylated vitamin hydroxylated at position 3 is treated with silver carbonate in a refluxing solution of an inert nonpolar solvent such as benzene or toluene, to which is added fully acylated glycoside or fully acylated straight or branched chain glycosidic polymer, either of these containing an appropriate leaving group L.G. at position C 1 of the terminal ring or on the single ring, as called for . Condensation occurs according to the following reaction, indicated here for a single glycoside for purpose of illustration only In this reaction sequence, R³ is as defined previously, LG is a common leaving group such as bromine, chlorine, iodine and p toluenesulfonyl, capable of being replaced in a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction. When the vitamin D₃ or D₂ is reacted with a glycosidic polymer, one or more of the OCOR³ groups in the glycopyranoside or glycofuranoside rings is replaced by a fully acylated glycosidic unit, with the proviso that the total number of glycosidic units not exeed 20. The reaction is carried out at from room temperature to refluxing conditions for a period of 1 10 hours, and is thereafter cooled and filtered to remove the silver salt. The filtrate is dried and the inert solvent is evaporated. The resulting product can be purified by any of the standard modern purification methods such as high performance liquid chromatography, silicic acid chromatography and thin layer preparative chromatography. A mixture of two products is normally obtained, being the α and β glycofuranosyl or glycopyranosyl derivatives at the point of ring attachment. These can normally be separated by the aforementioned chromatographic methods. After separation of the individual products, the glycosidic residues are deacylated in base, such as sodium methoxide in methanol, of ammonia in methanol. Further purification by high performance chromatography is usually indicated to obtain the highly purified product. When the starting vitamin D D₃ or D₂ carries two hydroxy groups such as 1 hydroxy vitamin D₃, or 25 hydroxy vitamin D₃ one of these needs to be selectively protected with a protecting group which can be ultimately removed after the condensation , and before, during or after the deacylation of the glycosidic residues. The same is true if three or more hydroxy groups are present in the vitamin starting materials, and less than all of these require to be glycosylated. The selective protection of hydroxy groups in the starting materials can be carried out by using standard protection and deprotection reactions, well known to those skilled in Organic Chemistry. Because each of the hydroxyl groups on the vitamin D molecule have different reactivities either due to the fact that they are either primary e.g. 26 OH , secondary eg. 24 OH, 3β OH, etc. or tertiary eg. 25 OH hydroxyl functions, selectivity can be achieved. Furthermore, because of steric considerations the 3β OH has different reactivity than the 1α OH which is both a vicinyl hydroxyl function as well as sterically hindered by the exocylic C₁₉ methylene function on C₁₀. A good example of these reactivities is illustrated in For protecting the 25 hydroxyl group for 25 hydroxyvitamin D₃ the following can be done 25 OH D₃ can be completely acetylated in acetic anhydride and pyridine under refluxing conditions for 24 h. The 3 Ac can be selectively removed by saponification KOH in 95 MeOH water at room temperature for 12 h. Once the desired protected vitamin D derivative is prepared, the same is reacted with silver carbonate or other methods for coupling as described e.g. by Igarashi, K., in Advances in Carbohydrate Chemistry and Biochemistry, Vol The acylated glycoside containing a leaving group at position C 1 of the first or only glycosidic ring can be prepared, for example, by the methods of Fletcher, H.G., Jr., Methods in Carbohydrate Chemistry Oligosaccharide intermediates can be prepared, for example by the methods of Lemieux, R.U., J. of Amer. Chem. Soc. Commercially available sugars include Pfanstiehl Laboratories, Inc. Pentoses, such as D arabinose, L arabinose, D Lyxose, L Lyxose, D Ribose, D Xylose, L Xylose Hexoses, such as Dextroses, D Fructose, D Galactose, α D Glucose, β D Glucose, L Glucose, Levulose, D mannose, L Mannose, L Sorbose Heptoses, such as D Glucoheptose, D Mannoheptulose, Sedoheptulosan Disaccharides, such as Cellobiose, 3 O β D Galactopyranosyl D arabinose, Gentiobiose, Lactoses, α Lactulose, Maltose, α Melibiose, Sucrose, Trehalose, Turanose Trisaccharides, such as Melezitose, Raffinose, Tetrasaccharides, such as Stachyose Polysaccharides and derivatives, such as Arabic Acid, Chitin, Chitosan, Dextrin, Cyclo Dextrins, Glycogen, Inulin. Alternatively, the whole synthetic sequence protection, condensation and deprotection can be carried out starting with a Δ⁵,⁷ steroidal diene which is a provitamin D. After glycosylation, the provitamin is ring opened photochemically, and the resulting previtamin is thermally rearranged to yield glycosilated vitamin. It is known Napoli, J.L. and DeLuca, H.F., in Burger s Medicinal Chemistry 4th Ed., part II, page 728 ff that the active form of vitamin D is 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D₃. When 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D₃ glycoside is used in the treatment of hypocalcemic states, or the regulation of phosphorus and calcium metabolism in an animal, especially in a human, the endogenous glycosidase enzymes of the animal directly release the active form of the vitamin. On the other hand, when non hydroxylated derivatives of the vitamin are used such as, e.g., vitamin D₃ glycoside , enzymatic release of the hydroxylated vitamin is followed by hydroxylation in the liver and then in the kidney in order to form the active 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin. The water soluble glycosilated vitimin D conjugates of the present invention include hydrophilic derivatives of good water solubility to derivatives of excellent water solubility. They can be used generally in any application where the use of vitamin D₃, vitamin D₂ or hydroxylated derivatives thereof has been called for in the prior art. The advantage of the conjugates of the invention resides in their water solubility and thus their ease of administration in aqueous media such as, for example, saline or aqueous buffers. This allows the utilization of these conjugates in such devices as vitamin D releasing in line pumps and intravenous dispensation. Other advantages include treatment of fat malabsorption syndromes, as well as release of the biologically active form of Vitamin D₃ in the gut, e.g. 1,25 OH ₂ D₃ glycoside gut 1,25 OH ₂ D₃ biological action. The conjugates of the invention can be administered by any means that effect the regulation of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis and metabolism in animals, especially humans. For example, administration can be topical, parenteral, subcutaneous, intradermal, intravenous , intramuscular, or interperitoneal. Alteratively or concurrently, administration can be by the oral route. The dosage administered will be dependent upon the age, health and weight of the recipient, kind of concurrent treatment if any, frequency of treatment, and the nature of the effect desired. Generally, a dosage of active ingredient compounds will be from about 0.1 µg to 1 mg per kg of body weight. Normally, from 0.1 µg to 10 µg per kg per application, in one or more applications per therapy, is effective to obtain the desired result. An additional unexpected property of the compounds of the invention is that some of them may demonstrate promotion of calcium absorption through the intestine without effecting calcium mobilization brought about by calcium release from bones. Calcium mobilization by bone release is a common feature of 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D₃. Its selective absence in some of the compounds of the invention has a beneficial therapeutic consequence by promoting an increase in serum calcium levels by stimulating intestinal calcium transport. It is disadvantageous for patients with severe bone disease to maintain serum calcium levels at the expense of mobilizing calcium from their already wasting bones. The compounds can be employed in dosage forms such as tablets, capsules, powder packets or liquid solutions, suspensions or elixirs for oral administration, or sterile liquids for formulations such as solutions or suspensions for parenteral use. In such compositions, the active ingredient will ordinarily always be present in an amount of at least 1x10 ⁶ by wt. based upon the total weight of a composition, and not more than 90 by wt. An inert pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is preferably used. Among such carriers are 95 ethanol, vegetable oils, propylene glycols and saline buffers. Having now generally described this invention, a more complete understanding can be obtained by reference to certain examples, which are included herein for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting unless otherwise specified.

Male weanling rats from Holtzmann Company, Madison, Wisconsin, U.S.A., were fed a vitamin D deficient diet that was adequate in phosphorus and low in calcium 0.02 for 3 1 2 weeks. Groups of five animals received orally either 4 µg, 1 µg, 0.5 µg, 0.25 µg of Vitamin D₃ 3β glucoside, 1 µg Vitamin D₃ 3α glucoside or 2 µg Vitamin D₃ 3β glucoside acetate in 50 µl of 95 ethanol or vehicle alone. 24 hours later the animals were sacrificed and the small intestine and blood were collected. Intestinal calcium transport studies were performed by the everted gut sac technique, and blood was used for serum calcium determinations. The results are shown in the following table The data show that the vitamin D₃, 3β glucoside is capable of stimulating intestinal calcium absorption, and bone calcium mobilization. The 3α glucoside is somewhat less active, while the 3β acetate appears inactive.
