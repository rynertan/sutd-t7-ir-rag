# A device for moving a printing member in an office printing machine.

## Abstract
In a printing office machine a movable print head is driven by a device comprising a fixedly mounted lead screw 10 and a co operating nut device 16 driven by an electric motor 34, 35 . The nut device is rotatably mounted in a carrier frame 31 and comprises an inner tube 17 which is journalled on the lead screw 10 . An outer tube 25 is journalled on the inner tube 17 . An end part of the outer tube 25 bears against a flange 26 on the inner tube 17 under friction. The two tubes are turnably interconnected by spring means 30 . The free ends of the tubes 17, 25 support ball bearings 20, 28 or the like which bear on flanks 14, 15 of grooves 13 cut in the lead screw 10 . Each bearing co operates with the groove flank which faces the respective tube end. The drive device has a very great freedom from play at the same time as the friction prevailing between the nut device and the lead screw is minimized.
