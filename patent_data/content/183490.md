# Method of making a welded can body.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a method of making a welded can body wherein the opposite marginal edge portions of a metallic blank are overlapped to form a can body preform with an overlapped portion, and then the overlapped portion is electric resistance mash seam welded by using a pair of wire electrodes abutting on both the surfaces of the overlap ped portion. At least one of a pair of the wire electrodes is formed with a flat main portion 17 37 and a marginal projection 18 38 including a slope 18a 38a contiguous to the flat main portion 17, 37 on the surface 15a thereof, which surface 15a is adapted to abut on the surface of the overlapped portion 12 . The overlapped portion of the can body preform 11 is fed in between the pair of wire electrodes 15, 16 35, 36 such that the edge face 11a₁ of one of the marginal edge portions 11a may be positioned on an area 17a 37b of the flat main surface portion 18a 38a in the vicinity of the slope 18a 38a or be positioned on the slope 18a 38a , allowing a blank material beside the edge face 11a₁ to flow outwardly in the circumferential direction of the can body preform 11 along the slope 18a 38a during the welding.
