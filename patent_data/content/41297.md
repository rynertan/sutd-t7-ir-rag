# Pyroelectric detector.

## Abstract
In order to reduce microphony due to the piezoelectric nature of a pyroelectric element 9 in a pyroelectric detector, the detector comprises one or more flexible films resiliently supporting the element 9 and two electrical connections thereto each comprising an electrically conductive layer 6,8 on the film s . There are suitably two films with the element 9 therebetween, the films being secured to one another around the element 9 by adhesive, thereby urging the films against the element 9 to hold it in position and maintain the electrical connections.
