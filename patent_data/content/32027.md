# Heat shrinkable laminate film and process for producing the same.

## Abstract
A heat shrinkable multilayer laminate film possessing excellent heat resistance, oil resistance and gas barrier prop erty is obtained by interposing an intermediate layer of a thermoplastic resin having a relatively low crystalline melting point between a core layer of a vinylidene chloride copolymer and at least one of the outer surface layers of an Î± olefin polymer having a relatively high crystalline melting point. The thus obtained laminate film can be in sheet or tubular form, and is suitable for use in packaging by heat shrinkage raw meat, processed meat, cheese and other fat containing food. This heat shrinkable laminate film is produced by biaxially stretching the starting laminate film at a specific temperature determined by the crystalline melting points of the resins of the intermediate layers and the outer surface layers.
