# Keyboard terminal type identification.

## Abstract
A CRT terminal comprises a CPU and a keyboard hav ing a key matrix, a microprocessor, and a set of switches. The microprocessor responds to a query data set ready signal from the CPU to read the states of the switches, and generate a sequence of characters indicating the particular characteristics of the keyboard. The first character indicates that the characteristics set by the switches are compatible with the microprocessor firmware, and whether the key board is hard or soft. The following characters indicate the states of the function keys auto line feed, local or remote for hard which produces characters in ASCII , plus con trol, capitals lock, and left and right shift for soft which produces straight binary coded characters .
