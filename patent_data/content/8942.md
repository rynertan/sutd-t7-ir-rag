# Compositions and processes for coating aluminium.

## Abstract
The corrosion resistance and paint adhesion of aluminium and its alloys is improved by contacting the aluminium or aluminium alloy surface with an aqueous acid solution containing polyacrylic acid or an ester thereof and at least one of H₂ZrF₆, H₂TiF₆ and H₂SiF₆, the pH of the solution being less than 3.5. The waste disposal problems associated with conventional chromate phosphate coating processes are avoided. The coating solution may be replenished with a concentrate containing polyacrylic acid or an ester thereof, at least one of H₂ZrF₆, H₂TiF₆ and H₂SiF₆, and a source of free fluoride, preferably hydrofluoric acid, to complex dissolved aluminium.
