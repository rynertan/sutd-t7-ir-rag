## Description
SYNTIfETIC FLUX FOR STEEL SLAG The object of the present invention is a flux or fluidifier for steel slag. The important function of slag in steel working and smelting processes is well itoom the slag, reacting with the molten metal, absorbs various impurities, as silicates, oxides, sulphur, phosphorous and others. The reaction between slag and molten metal is very important for steel production both in arc furnaces and in Martin Siemens furnaces and in oxygen converters wherein, over large quantities of material a continuous and diffused contact between the slag and the metal being smelted has to be produced and this is why the forming of the slag is studied ith particular care. For the process to start regularly, it is first of all necessary for the slag to be formed as rapidly as possible and with the rlght degree of viscosity . This rapidity in the forming of the slag is far more felt in modern technique, shere one tends to accelerate to the utmost all The stages of the steel tuorldng process. On the other hand, the slag is formed by introducing on the metal bath lime or limestone, which take a certain time to reach the molten state and to start the slagging action. To shorten this melting time, it is know to add to the lime and limestone some fluidifying agents or fluxes. As a general rule, the influence of the flux in the slag lowers the density of the same and the adhesion between steel and slag, favouring the rise of the material to be eliminated. A very well Imown and widespread fluidifier used nowadays is essentially fluorite, or fluorspar which however contains various impurities, as for example silicates, silica and sulphur, which produce delays and inconveniences in the production process. Moreover, the melting fluorite or fluorspar normally causes the development of harmful gases, as silicon tetrafluoride. It has also been proposed to use fluidifiers based on premixed mixtures of fluorite with other natural minerals, as dolomite, limestone and bauxite, however essentially for economical reasons but with no improvement of the technical characteristics of the actual fluidifi er. The chemical composition of the slag in oxygen converters is on the average the following CaO 3041 SiO2 25 27 A1203 2 3S Fe oxides 24 29 bigO 5 8 ESnO 4 7 P205 S 0.2 0.3S while, in arc furnaces, the slag contains a smaller quantity of Fe oxides.From the chemical point of view, it. is fundamental for this composition to keep a pre established degree of basicity, which is normally expressed by the formula basicity index CaO rlgO SiO2 P205 t 3.5 3.7 The object of the present invention is to propose a new type of flux for steel slag, being apt to answer the aforespecified requirements of basicity but allowing, on the other hand, to eliminnte the cited drawbacks of the known fluidifiers, in particular to eliminate the presence of great or small quantities of fluorite both alone and in mixture. This result is obtained dth the fluidifier according to the present invention, which is essentially characterized in that it con sists of a synthetic mixture of aluminous and or alumina residues with one or more of the compounds forming part of the group clay, marl calcareous clay , sodium carbonate, borax sodium borate , nepheline silicate and orthosilicate of Al, Na, K , and bentonite. It should immediately be pointed out that, by the term alu minous or alumina residues are meant scrap products coming from the production of aluminum, the average chemical analysis of which is the following 70 90 alumina Al203 6 15 metallic aluminum 10 12 mixtures of aluminum hydroxide, of aluminum trihy drate and of calciumaluminum silicates The various constituents may enter the formation of the mixture according to the present invention in the following proportions from 60 to 85 aluminous and alumina residues from 10 to 20 clay from 5 to 10 borax from 5 to 10 sodium carbonate from 10 to 20 marlfrom 5 to 30 nephelinefrom 5 to 10 bentonite Some examples of preferred compositions according to the present invention are given in the following table I II III IV V VIAluminous and alumina residues 85 80 70d 70 66 65 Marl 5 5 10 10 Clay 10 10 Sodium carbonate 5 5 10 10 10 8 Borax 5 Nepheline 5Z SS0 5 5 7 27 Bentonite 7 The essential object of the aforedescribed flux mixture is to favour and accelerate the formation of reactive slag with desulphu rizing and dephosphorizing qualities. An additional object of the present invention is however to also favour a slag reducing reaction. To this end, a further object,of the present invention consists in the use of sodium hydroxide NaCH and of calcium carbide CaC2 . The addition of NaOH to the flux is however not so simple, as the flux is thereby made highly hygroscopic and its storage, in the large quantities required for steel works, becomes extremely problematic. On the other hand, also tlle addtion of CaC2 is in turn very delicate, since this product may give rise, with humidity, to the forming of explosive mixtures. This problem is however overcome, according to the present invention, by prodiving to mix 1 part of CaC2 with 1 or 2 parts of NaOH and furthermore, preferably, with 2 parts of sodium carbonate. In this zayss it has been possible to establish that the mixture dried and reduced into grains is sufficiently stable. A better result is obtained by melting said mixture talcing advantage, for this part pose, of the low melting point of Nazi An even further stability and, above all, resistance to humi dity is conferred by introducing in this mixture also 2 parts of clay and 3 parts of limestone. This reducing mixture, essentially based on NaOH and CaC2, is introduced in the aluminous flux according to the invention in the proportion of from 2 to , according to the type of steel produced. Moreover it has been surprisingly found out that the addition of alkaline salts, specifically NaOH and or sodium carbonate to the aluninous flux, carries on a supplementary function of purification.As a matter of fact aluminous flux may easily contain impurities which, reacting with the alkaline salts, create cbmpounds being aftenrard absorbed in the lime slag of tlle furnace. Such allcaline salts are added to the aluminous flux in a percentage determined zit respect to the quantity of the impurities in the flux, and in any case inferior to 10 . They may be added in a solution state or in a dry state. The flux mixture according to the present invention is prefera bly prepared in pieces, grains or granules, for example through pelleting techniques known per se. For this purpose, binders can be added to the mixture, in proportions varying between 2 and 5 0, consisting for example of the mown binding resins and hardeners normally employed in tlle pelleting process, in the refractory mixtures and in the molding sands, such as the silicone resins, the epoxy resins the silicon organic resins, polyethylene oxide, ethylcellulose hydroxide , and the like, which volatilize at the melting temperature of the steel and do not affect, therefore, the correct forming of the slag. Furthermore, the use of molasses as a binder has been found particularly interesting. This product, which may be utilized at the pure state, owning to its intrinsic composition transforms itself at the high temperatures to which the flux is subjected leading to the formation of nascent carbon this in turn favours the reducing reaction of this slag. Considering that the modern metallurgical technique involves large quantities of oxygen both in oxygen converters and in arc furnaces ,the reducing feature of the flux, and hence of the slag, becomes highly important for realizing a certain neutralization of the excess of oxygen present in the actual molten slag. Finally, there is also the possibility to agglomerate the flux mixture in a way knolm per se by making use of pitch, eventually together with an equal quantity of molasses. The fluidifier according to the present invention has been tested in arc furnaces of 40, 60 and 70 tons and in oen converters, in carbon steel castings, with excellent results, particularly for what concerns the prompt formation of the slag. The tests have been carried out also in castings prepared lÅath different types of slags, always with excellent results. An essentially positive side effect has moreover been found in a reduction of the erosion effect of the furnace refractory lining at slag level which can clearly be ascribed to the slightly basic characteristics of the flux according to tlle invention.
