## Description
ne present invention relates to a method for treating whole plants, cut rlowers and or cut foliage to increase the vase lite ot cut flowers ana or cut foliage. but rlowers are a highly perishable product and because or tneir visual ana monetary value ettort has been expanded over the years to maximise cut flower longevity. The reason ror tne short vase lire or most flowers is not completely unuerstooa but can be attributed to suc factors as i water stress accentuatea by vascular blockage or microbial contamination, ii the high respiratory activity of petals, iii, the depletion of metabolites in the flower, and iv the sensivity or flowers to ethylene. ne present invention relates to a novel method for the treatment of cut flowers and or cut foliage to increase its vase life. The present invention consists in a method for increasing the vase life of cut flowers and or cut foliage comprising treating the cut rlowers with an aqueous solution containing from 0.01 milli Molar mM to 100 mM of a soluble nickel salt. In another embodiment of the invention, the method consists in growing whole plants, from which cut flowers anu or cut foliage can be obtained, in a nutrient solution containing rrom O.OlmM to 100mM of a soluble nickel salt. the present invention further consists in a preparation comprising a nickel salt in solid form or in a dilute or concentrateu aqueous solution together with instructions for tne use tnereof in aqueous solutions at a concentration ot from O.U1 to 100 mG for extending the vase life of cut tlowers or foliage. The expression vase life11 means the life of the cut rlowers or foliage storea with their cut stems in water or te said solution up until the flowers or toliage show visual aegraaation which aetracts from their aesthetic appeai. The expression also covers the situation in which the flowers or foliage are treated and then removed from the treatment solution for transport or aisplay without the benefit of naving their cut stems immersed in water or an aqueous solution. The treatment of the flowers or foliage will generally comprise immersing the cut stems thereof in the treatment solution. Uther methods of application may be effective.Such methods including foliar appiication. The treatment may be applied by immersing the cut stem of the flowers or foliage in an aqueous solution of a nickel salt for a substantial period of the life of the cut flowers or foliage i.e. the flowers or foliage are storea in a vase containing the nickel solution. In tis case the preferred concentration of the nickel salt is from 0.1 to 10 mM most preferably 0.1 to 2.5 aM. In another emboaiment of the invention the cut stems of the flowers or foliage may be immersed for a shorter period in a more concentrated solution of the nickel salt. In this case a concentration of from 2.0 to 100 mM is preferred. The treatment period may be from 1 minute to 5 hours however 5 minutes to 1 hour is most preferred. i referably, the treatment of the whole plants will comprise growing the plants hydroponically wherein the nutrient solution contains from 0.01mM to lO0mM of a soluble nickel salt. The treatment times and concentrations given above are typical and the optimum time and concentration may be aeterminea by simple experimentation for any given species or variety or flower. The iower levels of nickel concentration may be less than optimum in extending vase life while the higher levels may prove toxic to the flowers or foliage resuitiny in premature petal or leat drop or in aiscofouration thereof. The nickel salt used is preferably nickel sulfate, however, any soluble nickel salt could be used. Suitable salts inc jude nickel chloride, nickel nitrate, nickel ammonium sulfate and nickel acetate. The treatment according to this invention may be applied in conjunction with any other known method for prolonging the vase lite of cut flowers or foliage While the present applicants are not bound by this explanation it is believed that the nickel salts may work by inhibiting ethylene production in the flowers or foliage. These salts might aiso iiave an anti blockage effect preventing vascular blockage by microbial growth. If the above theories are correct other treatments such as the provision of metabolites and the treatment of flowers or foliage to prevent water stress may be used in conjunction with the present treatment to good erect. Hereinafter given by way of example only is a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Experiment 1Materials and Method C. frutescens biooms were held in solutions of 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2 5 mM nickel sulphate prepared from 0.1 stock solution NiSO.tH20 . Flowers were evaluated as previously described.Results All treatments of nickel sulphate significantly increased the vase life of C. frutescens. See Table 1 . At the optimum concentration, 1.5 mM, vase life was enhanced more than twice and could be separated from the other treatments at 5 level of the Studentized Range Test. No toxic symptoms developed and the stems and foliage remained a iiealthy green throughout the experiment. The flowers maintained their white appearance until wilting of the petals terminated vase life.

This enhancement of flower life could be a result of the ethylene inhibiting properties of nickel. Lau and Yang 1978 found that nickel decreased the conversion of methionine to ethylene in apple tissue and bean hypocotyl tissue. Nickel at the concentrations used did not produce any pigmentation in the stem or leaves, or toxicity symptoms in the flower head. Further research is needed to determine the real mechanism by which nickel is acting in the flower. On the present results nickel Ni2 appears very promising as a floral preservative with chrysanthemums. Experiment 2Materials and Method The C. frutescens flowers were obtained and prepared as described previously, all flowers being sorted for uniformity and randomized between the treatments. Thirteen treatments were assessed with eight flowers in each solution. Cobalt Co 2 was tested at lmM and 2mM, nickel sulphate at 1.25mM, 1.50mM and 1.75mM. The commercial preservative, Chrysal was tried at the recommended level at half strength, and at ohe and a half times the standard concentration. Other solutions that were tested were Ethanol at 5 , by volume, and 8 hydroxyquinoline at 225, 250, 275 ppm, in combination with 150ppm citric acid and 10 sucrose.Distilled water was used as a control.Results There is a strong suggestion of differences between the treatments see Table 2 . Only the nickel sulphate, ethanol and chrysal solutions were significantly better than the control but they cannot be separated from each other at the 5 level of the Studentized Range Text. However, obvious differences arose between these groups during the experiment, TABLE 2The Mean Vase Lite of C.frutescens Blooms in Potential Floral Preservative SolutionsTREATMENTSCo2 Co2 Ni2 Ni Ni2 Chrysal Chrysal Chrysal HQ HQ HQ Ethanol CONTROLDISTILLED 1mM 2mM 1.25mM 1.50mM 1.75mM 1 2rec. rec. 1 1 2rec 225 250 275 5 v v WATER ppm ppm ppmMEAN VASE LIFE 7.625 6.000 12.875 11.625 11.625 10.625 12.500 11.875 3.500 3.750 3.500 12.875 5.375 bc cd a a a ab a a d d d a cd means with the same letter are not significantly different at the 5 level of the Studentized RangeTestNOTE HQ is a solution of 8 hydroxyquinoline ppm plus 150 ppm Citric Acid and 10 sucrose Chrysaö is a commercial perservative.
