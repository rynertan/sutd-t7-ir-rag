# Torque limiting clutch.

## Abstract
An overload clutch comprising a driving part 15 and a driven part 20 releasably interconnected in torque transmitting relationship by balls 25 , held in a cage 28 in engagement with torque transmitting recesses 29, 30 of the parts 15, 20 and which can be disengaged by rela tive rotation between the driving and driven parts 15, 20 when the torque to be transmitted exceeds a predeter mined value and in which spacers 34 are moved by the cage 28 into spacing relationship with the parts 15, 20 to maintain the balls 25 out of engagement with the recesses 29, 30 after disengagement with the clutch, and wherein the clutch can be re engaged by relative rota tion between the parts 15, 20 in the reverse direction to that which caused disengagement by the provision of two pairs of inter engageable abutments 51, 52 58, 59 and a first control means 62a, 62b to prevent inter engagement of one pair of the abutments as a result of relative rotation when the clutch is disengaged and to permit of inter en gagement of the abutments of the other pair on resetting by relative rotation in the reverse direction, and second control means 60, 61 to maintain the abutments of both pairs out of inter engagement during the initial stages of disengagement of the clutch.
