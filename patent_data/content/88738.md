## Description
A FLUID ABSORBING PRODUCT AND A METHOD AND AN APPARATUS FORMANUFACTURING SUCH PRODUCT. The present invention relates to a fluid absorbing product and a method and a device for manufacturing such product. Known products of said type consist as such of high grade material and material combinations. In the most simple form thereof a fluid absorbing product may be regarded as a piece of equipment that allows inflow of a fluid to an absorbing core via a first side or portion thereof, but prevents penetration for the rest. The inflow of a fluid for instance may take place through a layer of so called fibre cloth non woven which as such also might possess a certain absorption capacity. A high liquid absorption is obtained by cellulose based fibres cellulose, cotton, rayon , while synthetic fibres as polypropylene and polyester have a very low absorption capacity. As far as the pliability and handling of the non woven material are concerned the fibre cloth material does not induce any problems in lines for manufacturing napkins, sanitary napkins, baby napkins, brief shields, sterile dressings, bandage material, etc. The material for instance may be manufactured with a surface 2 weight as low as 10 g m and still hav e an acceptable strength. In addition to the necessary characteristics of allowing passage of fluid to the absorbing core, the fibre cloth material also acts to maintain the core in a proper position. Generally, the core consists of defibrated cellulose defibrate and additionally might include inserts of super absorbing material. In order to give the fluid absorbing product penetra tlon preventing characteristics a liquid leakage barrier in the regions thereof where absorption is not desired, it previously simply has been inserted a loose film of plastics, for instance a polyethylene film, between the core and the carrier material. In certain cases the need for measures against leakage even has been neglected. According to the present invention it has been realized that this is not an acceptable solution to the problem of providing fully acceptable fluid absorbing products by means of a proper manufacturing method and a machinery line that is useful in practice. The object of the present invention, therefore, is to obviate said drawback of the known technique and offer a more advantageous alternative. The invention provides, in the broadest sense thereof, a product based on a fluid absorbing core having a fluid penetration preventing layer on portion thereof. The product is characterized in that the fluid absorbing core comprises a layer of a fluid absorbing material known per se, for instance a defibrate of cellulose fibres, and in that the penetration preventing layer is formed by at least a portion of at least one strip of a carrier material, for instance a fibre cloth material non woven , extrusion strip coated by a thermoplastics material. The strip coated carrier material is coated by using extrusion coating thechniques in an extruder having an extrusion orfice cross wise the machine direction. Thereafter the material is cut length wise in a suitable manner for providing the desired coverage of the penetration preventing portion of the carrier material. Said at least one strip portion of the carrier material covers preferably at least a portion of a broad side of the core and at least a portion of two narrow sides of the core oriented in the longitudinal direction of the strips. In a preferred embodiment the core with a broad side thereof is placed between two strips strip portions. According to a further preferred embodiment at least the major portion of a broad side of the core is placed between two strips strip portions. It is to be preferred that each one of the two strips covers a portion of the broad side of the core and at least a portion of a respective one of the narrow sides of the core. In order to obtain an especially preferable fluid barrier, each strip wit one boarder edge extends a distance into the fluid absorbing side of the core. In the region of said boarder edge the strips strip portions preferably have thicker plastics layers. This is accomplished by properly cutting in a length wise direction the carrier material which is coated by strip extrusion coating into an inhomogeneous layer thickness. In order to facilitate the machine handling it is preferred to let the other boarder edge portions overlap and seal them on the side of the core opposite to the fluid absorbing side. In a simple embodiment, said boarder edge portions are sealed by the thermoplastic coating strip. In another embodiment, the boarder edge portions are sealed by a binder, for instance hot melt, which is applied at least along a portion of the boarder edge portions. Preferably, the carrier material is sealed cross wise the core and the strips for forming products of a desired length. In an advantageous embodiment, the absorbing core is maintained in place against the uncoated areas of the carrier material by being anchored to the pores of the carrier material. The invention also provides a method and a machinery for the manufacture of the product, as more specifically appears from the accompanying claims. Some embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, whereFigure 1 schematically shows a line for the manufacture of fluid absorbing products according to the inven tion, for instance napkins, brief shields, etc.,Figure 2 in partial view shows a strip coated carrier material web,Figure 3 shows the web in Figure 2 cut longitudinally and together with an absorbing core,Figure d shows the arrangement in Figure 3 in section, Figure 5 in section shows the core according to Figure 4 with the carrier material applied around the core, andFigures 6 to 9 show variants of the application of strip coated carrier material around absorbing bodies. The reference numeral .10 in Figure 1 indicates a supply.roller of carrier material. Said material consists of strip coated fibre cloth material non woven material which has been extrusion strip coated by thermoplastics, for instance polyethylene, and thereafter cut length wise into the desired width. The length wise cutting might for instance be carried out along the broken lines 13 in Figure 2 in an extrusion strip coated, wide material web 14. This gives for instance an addition of thickness of the plastics material in strategically important positions, if the cut material is placed as for instance in Figures 3 to 5. The extrusion coating, namely, inherently implies thickening of the outer edges of the strips. A web 12 of absorbing core material fluff material , for instance of the defibrated cellulose type, is fed through a chopper 15 to the upper side of the web 11 where the material is spread out as a string 16 of sufficient thickness for the desired absorption capacity. A cross wise discontinuity for allowing an efficient cross wise seal is obtained in the web 16 by a rotating multi orfice suction device 17, in the present case comprising three suction orfices 18, one at each corner thereof. By giving the suction device a suitable. rotation speed there are obtained individually separated core pieces 19 at the output side thereof. Said pieces 19 are attached by suction to the pores of the carrier material 11 in a suction pressure station 20.The arrow in Figure 1 represents a pressure function and the box under the web is a suction box. After the station 20, there eventually follows a first binding agent applicator 21, for instance a hot melt applicator, for applying a binding agent for Lhe cross sealing operation in an end station 22. A first folding bar 23, for folding one 24 Figure 3 of the side portions of the carrier material protruding from the absorption core 17, is arranged after the suction pressure device and applicator 21. If required in certain cases to apply 9 specific binding agent in order to obtain sealing longitudinally, there is arranged a.further hot melt applicator 25. Thereafter follows a further folding station 26 for folding inwards and sealing of the other protruding edge portion of the web 27 against the already folded in first portion. Finally, after this sealing, cross wise se aling and cutting to finished products 28 is carried out in the end station 22. Figures. 3 to 5 show a first version of an absorbing product, for instance a sanitary towel, brief shield, etc. In this case the absorbing core 17 is placed such that onebroad side 29 thereof with edge portions extended into the strip coated regions 30, 31 which here broadly coincide with the extension of the edge portions 24, 27. This implies that after the folding of the end portions to the position according to Figure 5, the coated region of the product will cover completely the upper side 32 of the core, the two longitudinal narrow sides 33, 34 and will extend around the corners 35, 36 to positions 37, 38 a distance inwards the fluid penetrating broad side 29 of the absorbing body. This has turned out to be an excellent guarantee against leakage of liquid laterally out from the body, especially as the plastics layer is thicker in the regions 37, 38.If the product for instance is a brief shield, this implies that practically all lateral leakage is prevented independently of displacing forces acting on the shield. In this connection it may be mentioned that the actual brief shield is attached to the brief in a known manner with the upper side 39 of the carrier material against the brief. The longitudinal seal 40 shown in Figure 5 might be a dot wise or string wise hot melt seal, alternatively the sealing may be accomplished by directly using the thermoplastics 30, 31. The variants in Figures 6 to 9 show different methods of longitudinally cutting the strip coated carrier material according to the invention and different placements of the absorbing body on the carrier. In the embodiment according to Figures 6 and 7 there is one strip 30 or strip portion merely and the folding of the carrier material is intended to take place along the broken lines 41. The version in Figure 8 discloses an embodiment where the broad side 27 of the absorbing body 17 exposed to fluid penetration is smaller than the distance between the coated strips strip portions 30, 31. The embodiment according to Figure 9 resembles the one in Figure 5, but the longitudinal seal 40 is displaced relative the centre line 42 in that the strips strip por tions have different width. If the carrier material is of the absorbing type the core 17 might advantageously be placed against the uncoated side of the carrier material c.f. Figures 4 and 5 .
