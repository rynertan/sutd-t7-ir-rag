# Thermal transfer recording apparatus.

## Abstract
A device associated with thermal transfer recording apparatus for boosting a pressing force of a thermal head 32 against a platen roller 36 . The thermal head 32 is mounted on one end portion of an elongate support plate 34 which is movable in a seesaw motion about a fulcrum B . Output torque of a rotary solenoid device 38 is transmitted to the support plate 34 by a rotary shaft 40 which is connected to the solenoid device, so that the support plate is moved about the fulcrum to press the head against the platen 36 . During recording, an extra drive force is derived from a tension of an ink sheet 50 and imparted via the rotary shaft 40 to the support plate 34 to move the support plate, serving to further intensify the pressing force of the head against the platen.
