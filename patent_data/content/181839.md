# AQUEOUS EMULSIONS OF UNSATURATED POLYESTER RESINS FOR SIZING GLASS FIBERS

## Abstract
Emulsions of unsaturated polyester resins for dressing glass fibers for the production of glass reinforced resin articles are described herein. Peculiar characteristics of the invention are high mechanical stability, low hydrophylic property, high resistance to hydrolysis and a good substan tivity and compatibility with the resin matrix of the final manufactured article.
