# Shift register latch circuit operable as a D type edge trigger and counter comprising a plurality of such latch circuits.

## Abstract
A shift register latch circuit consists of a polarity hold latch 1 connected to a set reset latch 2 . The latches can be clocked with separate non overlapping clock trains A, B and C so that automatically generated test pat terns can be applied to a scan input s to test the circuit. This conforms to the so called Level Sensitive Scan Design LSSD rules. During system operation, the shift register latch circuit operates as a D type edge trigger by con necting the clock input B of the set reset latch 2 to the clock C supplied to the polarity hold latch 1 . By con necting a number of shift register latches together a John son counter can be formed and by clocking all latches with a single oscillator, a series of non overlapping clock trains can be produced. Implementations of the shift register latch in AND circuits or AND OR INVERT circuits are described.
