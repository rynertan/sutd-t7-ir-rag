# Apparatus for recording and or reproducing signals on an information carrier provided with a loading mechanism for loading the information carrier.

## Abstract
In an apparatus for recording and or reproducing sig nals on an information carrier comprising a loading me chanism for loading the information carrier 21, 85 , a draw er 10, 76 is provided, which is rectilinearly retractable and extensible between an opened and a closed position which carries a platform 24, 86 . The drawer 10, 76 has in side walls 15, 16, 81 , viewed in the inward direction, upwardly extending guiding grooves or slots 27, 82, 83 in which the platform 24, 86 is guided so as to be movable in the direc tion of height with respect to the drawer 10, 76 between an upper and a lower position. The platform 24, 86 is moved during a first part of the inward movement over the horizon tally arranged surface 33a, 79a of at least one positioning element 33, 79 and is held in the grooves or slots 27, 82, 83 at the level of the upper position and is then urged dur ing a second part of the inward movement against at least one fixedly arranged upwardly directed stop 35, 101 , then moves in the grooves or slots 27, 82, 83 down the stop 35, 101 in a direction substantially perpendicular to the sup porting means 20, 102 for the information carrier to the lower position.
