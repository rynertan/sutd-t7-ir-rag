# PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF FLEXIBLE CIRCUITS

## Abstract
Process for the preparation of flexible circuits for med from flexible photohardenable eiements having at least one organic elastomeric polymeric binder which comprises a exposing imagewise said element, b applying particulate conductive metal, e.g., nickel, copper, to the unexposed image areas, optionally, c heating the metal bearing areas, then d removing excess metal particles, optionally e fixing the particulate metal to the layer by heat ing, exposing to UV light or mechanical embedding, and f plating electrolessly or soldering the metal con taining areas. The process can be operated continuously to prepare single and double layer flexible printed cir cuits, membrane switches, etc.
