# VACUUM BOOSTING DEVICE

## Abstract
A vacuum boosting device for motor vehicles fitted with vacuum operated load systems, the vacuum being provided by the engine air induction in the case of a petrol engine or by a suitable vacuum pump 34 in a Diesel engine. The device acts to increase the rate of evacuation of the load system 15 when the vacuum of the engine is weaker than a predetermined value, by increasing the idling revolutions of a petrol engine, or acting on a throttle valve 19 in the air inlet 18 of a Diesel engine so as to create a vacuum in the induction manifold to assist the vacuum pump 34 in evacuating the load circuit.
