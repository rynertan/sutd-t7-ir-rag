# PROCESSOR AND METHOD FOR PROCESSING PHOTOGRAPHIC FILM DISCS

## Abstract
A processor 20 for processing undeveloped photogra phic film discs 30 mounted on a spindle assebly 31 has a conveyor 52, 54, 62, 64 to intermittently convey the spindle assembly 31 along a generally horizontal conveyor path. The spindle assembly 31 is conveyed to a plurality of pro cessing stations 60a 60h, 61a 61h on the conveyor path, with each processing station having a processing tank 100 114 . During processing, the processing tanks 100 114 pivot between an upward process position and a downward dump transport position. In their upward process position, selected processing tanks are filled with process ing fluids. When the spindle assembly 31 is positioned at one of the selected processing tanks 100 114 and that tank is in its upward process position and filled with processing fluid, portions of the film discs 30 on the spindle assembly 31 are contacted by the processing fluid. The spindle 31 and discs 30 are then rotated to uniformly contact the pho tographic images on the film discs 30 with the processing solution. While the conveyor 52, 54, 62, 64 advances the spindle assembly 31 to a next processing station, the pro cessing tanks 100 114 are pivoted to their downward dump transport position and the processing fluid is dumped from the selected processing tanks.
