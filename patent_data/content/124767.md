# COMPLIANT PIN

## Abstract
A compliant electrical connector pin has opposed convex surfaces to grip the surfaces of a hole in a circuit board, the pin having a compliant region so that the pin compresses to reduce the cross sectional area of the pin as the pin is inserted into the hole with the pin having a transition zone proximate the compliant region with the transition zone and the com pliant region sufficiently interrlated so that the transition zone partially expands the hole in the circuit board before the hole in the circuit board begins to compress the compliant region of the pin with the compliant region and the hole coacting to provide a low resistance electrical connection between mat ing surfaces of the hole and the pin without rupturing the material on the side walls of the hole with the compliant pin structure being able to withstand vibration without fracturing.
