## Description
Title of the Invention PROCESS FOR REMOVING NITROGEN OXIDES AND CARBON MONOXIDE SIMULTANEOUSLYBackground of the Invention The present invention relates to a process for removing nitrogen oxides hereinafter referred to as NOx and carbon monoxide from exhaust gases e.g. of fixed sources such as combustion furnaces such as boilers of electric power plants and gas turbines, nitric acid plants and iron manufacturing plants, and converting them into harmless substances in an efficient and economical manner. Various processes have been proposed for removing NOx and CO from exhaust gases. Among them, processes for removing NOx can be classified roughly into adsorption, absorption and reduction processes. In another aspect, these processes are classified into dry and wet processes.Among them, a process wherein NO, is reduced into harmless nitrogen with a reducing gas such as ammonia, hydrogen, carbon monoxide or a hydrocarbon is employed most ordinarily.An example of a process of reducing NO, into harmless nitrogen with ammonia is disclosed in US patent No. 4,085,193. On the other hand, examples of the processes for removing CO include absorption, adsorption and oxidation processes. For removing NO, and CO simultaneously, a process has been proposed which comprises reacting NOx with CO directly on a catalyst to convert them into harmless nitrogen and CO2, respectively, which method is disclosed in SURFACE ,Vol. 23, No.9 1985 , pages 510 511. This process is effective to remove NO, and CO from an exhaust gas in which 02 is not almost contained. However, the process has a defect that when the exhaust gas contains Oz, the reaction ofCO with 02 occurs in preference to the reaction of CO withNOx and, therefore, the amount of CO usable for reducing NOx becomes insufficient and the NOx removing capacity of the process is reduced. Thus, the most effective conventional process for removing NOx and CO from an exhaust gas containing 2 is thought to be one comprising oxidizing CO into CO2 over an oxidation catalyst and then adding ammonia thereto to remove NOx by reduction carried out in the presence of a denitration catalyst. However, this process is uneconomical, since both CO oxidation catalyst and NOx removal catalyst are necessitated. Further, it has been difficult to effect the reduction of NOx with NH3 and oxidation of CO simultaneously in the presence of only one catalyst in the prior art, since the catalyst effective for the oxidation of CO is also effective for the oxidation of NH3. Summary of the Invention An object of the present invention is to provide a process for removing CO and NOx simultaneously froi an exhaust gas containing 02 from a fixed source in an economical and efficient manner by overcoming the above mentioned defects of the conventional techniques under these circumstances. The process of the present invention developed for the purpose of attaining the above mentioned object is characterized in that a gas comprising NOx, CO and 02 is contacted with a catalyst in the presence of steam and ammonia to reduceNOx into harmless N2 and also to react CO with H20 to convert them into CO2 and H2 over the same catalyst. To carry out the reactions capable of attaining the above mentioned purpose of the invention, a catalyst effective for the reactions of NO, with NH 3 as shown in the following formulae 1 and 2 and the reaction of CO withH20 as shown in the following formula 3 is necessitated 1 3 NO NH3 4O2 N2 3H2O ......................... 1 3NO2 4NH3 N2 6H2O ................ 2 CO H2O CO2 H2 ..................... 3 A catalyst comprising the following components satisfies the above mentioned conditions titanium oxide as a main component, oxide of at least one metal selected from the group consisting of molybdenum, tungsten, vanadium, cerium, nickel, cobalt and manganese as the second component and at least one metal selected from the group consisting of noble metals, i.e. platinum, palladium, rhodium and ruthenium as the third component. Preferable components of the catalyst are titanium oxide as a main component, oxide of one metal selected from the group consisting of molybdenum, tungsten, vanadium and manganese as the second component, and platinum as the third component. Further, a catalyst including oxide of at least one metal selected from the group consisting of iron, chromium and copper in addition to the main component, the second component and third component is preferable. Now, the description will be made on the reasons why this catalyst has the desired properties. Though a catalyst comprising the above mentioned main component, i.e. titanium oxide, and also the above mentioned second component, i.e. oxides of molybdenum, tungsten, vanadium, cerium, nickel, cobalt andyor manganese, is remarkably effective on the denitration of the above formulae 1 and 2 , its effect on the CO conversion of the above formula 3 is poor.However, when the above mentioned third component, i.e. at least one of the above mentioned noble metals is added to this catalyst, the effects of the catalyst on the CO conversion are improved . According to the inventors experiments, atomic percentages of the respective metal components to the total of metals of the main, second and third components are preferred as follows a 50 to 97 of titanium of the main component, b 1 to 50 of the second component, and c 0.02 to 5 of the noble metal used as the third component.It is preferable to add, to the above mentioned noble metal or metals, 1 to 20 of iron, chromium or copper as the additional third component in the form of their oxide, whereby the COconversion is further improved. More than 50 of components of the catalyst Preferablv consists of the main component in the form of oxide, the second component, and the third component optionally including the additional third component in the form of their oxide , as aL nti oned Preferably, the catalyst is to be an intimate mixture of the main component in the form of oxide, the second component in the form of oxide and the third components. The most preferable catalyst comprises titanium as the main component in the form of oxide vanadium, manganese, tungsten or molybdenum as the second component in the form of oxide and platinum as the third component. Atomic percentages of metal components included in the catalyst as the main, second and third components are as follows Ti 68 97 ........................... main component V, Mo, W, or Mn 2 30 ............... second component Pt 0.02 2 .......................... third component more than 50 by weight of this catalyst also consists of Ti one of V, Mo, W, and Mn and Pt. Preferably, they are in a state of an intimate mixture. In the process of the present invention, NO, is converted into harmless N2 and H20 as shown in the above formulae 1 and 2 and CO is converted into CO2 and H2 as shown in the above formula 3 . Usually, H2 is further reacted with 02 over the catalyst to form H20. Therefore, when the gas to be treated contains 02, usually only a very small amount of H2 is contained in the gas after it is passed through the catalyst bed. In the process of the present invention, the molar ratio of steam to carbon monoxide contained in the gas is preferably at least 5 1 prior to se contact thereof with the catalyst, since when the molar ratio is below 5 1, the reaction of the formula 3 does not proceed sufficiently and a high CO removal rate cannot be obtained easily. The molar ratio of ammonia to NOx is preferably in the ranqe of 0.5 to 2 1, since when this ratio is below 0.5 1, a high NOx removal rate cannot be obtained and when it exceeds 2 1, a large mount of unreacted NHs is discharged and, therefore, ammonia is required in a large amount economically disadvantageously. The reaction temperature in the step of removing nitrogen oxides by the reduction and converting carbon monoxide in the Drocess of the present invention is preferably selected in the range of 150 to 600 C, more preferably 250 to 4000C. When the reaction temperature is below 1500C, both of the denitration velocity and carbon monoxide conversion velocity may be insufficient and a large amount of the catalyst is necessitated economically disadvantageously, while when the reaction temperature exceeds 6000C, ammonia used as the reducing agent for NOx is oxidized into NOx to seriously reduce the NOx removal rate. In the removal of NOx and CO from an exhaust gas by the process of the present invention, the space velocity in terms of superficial velocity under conditions of NTP is for example selected in the range of 1,000 to 100,000 h l, preferably 2,000 to 60,000 h l, since when the space velocity is below 1,000 h l, a large amount of the catalyst is necessitated economically disadvantageously, while when it exceeds 100,000 h 1, high NOx and CO removal rates cannot be attained.The reaction column may be of any of known fixed, moving or fluidized bed systems. The catalyst having quite a high capacity of removingNOx and CO can be obtained by a process employed usually in the production of catalysts such as precipitation, kneading or impregnation process. The catalyst may be molded into a final form by any process selected suitably depending on the use thereof such as ordinary extrusion, tableting or rolling process. The shape of the catalyst is not particularly limited and it may be globes, cylinders, rings, honey combs or plates. The titanium sources used in the preparation of the catalyst of the present invention include titanium oxides as well as compounds which form titanium oxides by heating, such as titanium hydroxides and titanic acids. A preferred process for preparing titanium oxides comprises reacting a titanium halide, titanium sulfate or organotitanium compound witd aqueous ammonia or an alkali hydroxide or alkali carbonate to form a titanium hydroxide precipitate and then thermally decomposing it to form a corresponding titanium oxide. The sources of molybdenum, vanadium, tungsten, cerium, nickel, cobalt and manganese used as the second component include oxides thereof and various compounds capable of forming these oxides by heating. In case hydroxides of these components can be prepared by adding an alkaline precipitating agent to an aqueous solution of its nitrate, sulfate or chloride, the obtained hydroxide can be thermally decomposed to obtain the second component. As the starting materials for the noble metal used as the third component, chlorides, nitrates and complex salts of them can be used. The iron, chromium and copper sources include oxides of them as well as compounds which form these oxides by heating such as hydroxides, nitrates, chlorides and sulfates. A preferred process comprises adding an alkaline precipitating agent to an aqueous solution of such a slat to form a hydroxide and then thermally decomposing the same.Brief Description of the Drawing Fig. 1 is graphs showing NOx removal and CO removal rates obtained by a process of removing NOx and CO simultaneously according to the present invention. Example 1 A catalyst used in the process of the present invention was prepared as follows 500 g of titanium tetrachloride Tici4 was dissolved in about 1 Q of distilled water. It was then neutralized with about 2 Q of 5 N aqueous ammonia to form a precipitate, which was washed thoroughly by decantation and filtered.A solution prepared by dissolving 54 g of ammonium paramolybdate in 500 mll of hot water was added to the precipitate and the mixture was kneaded well with a mixing machine.The obtained slurry was dried and further mixed thoroughly with graphited of 1 wt. of the resultant substance and the mixture was molded into tablets having a diameter of 6 mm and a height of 6 mm. The tablets were calcined at 5000C for 2 h.The oxide had an atomic ratio of titanium to molybdenum ti Mo of 9 1. The tablets were pulverized and 100 g of a 10 to 20 mesh fraction was taken and impregnated with 40 mQ of an aqueous hexachloroplatinic acid solution. After drying at 1200C for 5 h followed by calcination at 5000C for 2 h, a catalyst 1 containing 0.5 wt. of platinum was obtained. The capacities of the catalyst for removing NOx and CO were determined by means of a flow reaction device of fixed bed type under atmospheric pressure. The reaction tube used was a quartz glass tube having an inner diameter of 20 mm and also having a thermocouple protecting quartz tube having an outer diameter of 5 mm. The reaction tube was heated in an electric furnace and the temperature was measured with the thermocouple.About 4 m of the above mentioned, sized catalyst was placed in the center of the reaction tube and a reaction gas of the following composition was introduced therein at a space velocity of 60,000 h 1 NOx 200 ppm NH3 240 ppm CO 1,000 ppm 2 1 H20 10 N2 the balance NOx was analyzed with a chemiluminescent NOx analyzer and CO was analyzed with a non dispersion infrared CO analyzer.

The capacities of the catalyst 2 are shown in Fig. 1. It is apparent from this figure that, though its capacity of removing NOx is slightly lower than that of the catalyst 1 at low temperatures, it exhlbits high NOx and CO removal rates. Example 3 A catalyst 3 was prepared as follows 7 g of ammonium metavanadate NH4VO3 was added to 500 g of a metatitanic acid slurry 150 g of Tin , 500 m of distilled water was added to the mixture and the obtained mixture was kneaded thoroughly with a kneader. The obtained pasty mixture was pre calcined at 3000C for 2 h. 1 wt. of graphite was added thereto and the mixture was molded into tablets having a diameter of 6 mm and a height of 6 mm under a molding pressure of about 500 kg cm2. The tablets were calcined at 5000C for 2 h. The oxide had an atomic ratio of titanium to vanadium Ti V of 97 3. The tablets were pulverized and 100 g of 10 to 20 mesh fraction was taken and impregnated with 40 mi of an aqueous hexachloroplatinic acid solution.After drying at 1200C for 5 h followed by calcination at 5000C for 2 h, the catalyst 3 containing 0.5 wt. of platinum was obtained.
