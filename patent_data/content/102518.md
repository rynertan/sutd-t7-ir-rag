# Composition for forming thick magnetic recording medium.

## Abstract
A composition comprising 70 by weight or less of magnetic particles and 30 by weight or more of a resin mixture of a an epoxy resin, b a phenol resin and c polyvinyl butyral, the weight ratios of the resin components being b a 2.5 7.5 to 4 6 and c a b 2.5 7.5 to 4 6, can give a thick magnetic recording medium excellent in film strength, resistance to cracks and durability by screen printing by one coating.
