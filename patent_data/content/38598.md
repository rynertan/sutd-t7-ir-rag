# Apparatus for dispensing a material into the atmosphere.

## Abstract
A pressurized can 3 containing material to be dispensed by evaporation is inserted into a case 1 and secured therein by latches 16 . An actuator assembly comprises an annular solenoid 21,22 surrounding a plunger 28 . The plunger 28 has an axial bore for receiving a shaft tube 29 which is pressed by plunger 28 on a can valve when the solenoid 21,22 is energized. The shaft tube 29 is provided with a nozzle tube 31 extending toward the opening 37 of an annular electrical heating device 34 comprising a perforated disk 39 . Material from the can 3 is released by energizing the solenoid 21,22 automatically at selectable time intervals for preset durations. The material falls on the heated perfo rated disk 39 and evporates through the holes 40 in the disk 39 into the atmosphere. Higher amounts of insecticide, deodorant and disinfectant agents can be automatically evaporated into a space of higher volume with less material by this apparatus.
