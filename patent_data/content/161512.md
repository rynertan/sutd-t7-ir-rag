# Program identification system.

## Abstract
A system for identifying programs such as television programs received from various sources detects the occur rence of predetermined events such as scene changes in a video signal and extracts a signature from the video signal. The signatures and the times of occurrence of the sig natures are stored and subsequently compared with re ference signatures to identify the program. The signatures may be compared in pairs to increase resolution, and the time interval between events or signatures may also be used to identify the program, either by themselves or in conjunction with the signatures.
