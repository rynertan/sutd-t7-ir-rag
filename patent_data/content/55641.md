# Ignition advance timing system for an internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
Ignition advance timing system for generating the ignition signal in an internal combustion engine by utilizing both the advantages of an angular based system and a time based system, this timing system comprising a timing wheel 10 operatively connected to the crank shaft of the engine 26 and carrying groups 14 of teeth 16 , each group 14 of teeth 16 representing the angular range of ignition for a particular engine cylinder, and the angular space 29 between the respective groups 14 of teeth 16 allowing a microcomputer 12 to begin a computing period free of any interrupt signals generated from the teeth 16 of the timing wheel 10 , said microcomputer 12 determining the desired angle which is synchronized with the teeth 16 of the timing wheel 10 to find the closest advance angle, while by means of a timer incorporated in the microcomputer 12 the desired angle is generated.
