# Method of controlling impact force and shock interval in drop hammers.

## Abstract
A drop hammer has a core 10 and a number of casings 12, 14, 16, 19 arranged concentrically around the core 10 . Between the core 10 and the casings 12, 14, 16, 19 spac ings are arranged, and the core 10 and the casings 12, 14, 16, 19 are interconnected alternatingly at one end and the other beginning at the upper end 13 of the core 10 . Between the lower end of the core 10 and those ends of one or more casings 12, 14, 16, 19 which are not per manently connected, a shock wave transferring connection is provided to short circuit the path of the shock wave through the core 10 and the casings 12, 14, 16, 19 .

## Description
METHOD OF CONTROLLING IMPACT FORCE AND SHOCK INTERVALIN DROP HAMMERS The invention relates to drop hammers for driving piles or the like into the ground, comprising a core which forms an impact surface at one end thereof, and casings which are mutually spaced substantially concentrically around the core, the casing closest to the core being connected at one end thereof with the core at the other end thereof while other casings are interconnected alternatingly at one end and the other beginning at the other end of said casing closest to the core. In the ideal case a drop hammer should be substantially of the same length as the pile to be driven down into the ground by means of the drop hammer. However, this is impractical and therefore the drop hammer is arranged as described above in order to obtain a long path of propagation for the shock wave while the drop hammer as such has a short length. More particularly, the invention relates to a method of controlling impact force and shock interval in a drop hammer of the type referred to above. It is desired to control impact force and shock interval for the reason that for driving a pile into the ground it may be necessary to have less force and longer shock instead of greater force and shorter shock in order that the pile will not wreck during driving. It is therefore desired to make possible that impact force and shock interval are adapted to the ground conditions and the pile material in the most favourable manner. The object of the invention is td make possible such adaption, which in a drop hammer of the type referred to is achieved by the method of the invention having obtained the characteristics accordina to the claim. For explanation of the invention in more detail reference is made to the accompanying drawing, in which FIG. 1 is a longitudinal cross sectional view of a drop hammer of the type used in practising the method of the invention, and FIG. 2 is a fragmentary longitudinal cross sectional view similar to that in FIG. 1 of the lower end of the drop hammer. The drop hammer in FIG. I comprises a cylindrical core 10 which forms an impact surface 11 at one end thereof. At the other end a first casing 12 is permanently connected to the core 10 at 13, and this casing surrounds the core concentrically spaced therefrom. Outside the casing 12 a second casing 14 is arranged concentrically with the core, and also the casings 12 and 14 are mutually spaced.The casing 14 is permanently connected to the casing 12 at the lower end of the drop hammer at 15, and it is surrounded by a third casing 16 which is concentric with the core and is spaced from the casing 14. At 17 at the upper end of the drop hammer a permanent connection is provided between the casings 14 and 16 while said latter casing 16 at the lower end of the drop hammer is permanently connected at 18 to a fourth casing 19 spaced from the casing 16 and arranged concentrically with the core. A shock wave generated in the core 1Q when hitting a pile at the impact surface 11, will propagate through the core to the upper end thereof and via the connection at 13 to the casing 12, then downwards through said latter casing and via the connection at 15 upwards through the casing 14 from which the shock wave will pass to the casing 16 via the connection at 17 to propagate down the casing 16 and then via the connection 18 upwards through the casing 19, The shock w ave then will be reflected back along the path described to the impact surface 11. I n order to shorten the propagation path of the shock wave there is provided by the method according to the invention a shock wave transferring connection, short circuiting , between the core and a voluntary number of casings. Thus, a short circuiting is shown in FIG. 1 between the core 10 and the second casing 14 and it is provided by means of a ring 20 at the lower end of the drop hammer such that the shock wave will propagate from the impact surface 11 via the ring 20 and the connection 15 directly to the casing 14 so as to follow thereafter the same path as before to the upper end of the casing 19. This shortening of the path of the shock wave provides a greater impact force however, the shock interval will be shorter. The impact force can be further increased by short circuiting several casings as is shown in FIG. 2 wherein a ring 20 forms a shock wave transferring connection from the core 10 directly to the outermost casing 19, which means that the shock interval will be still shorter than in the arrangement shown in FIG. 1 By using rings of different sizes in order to provide a shock wave transferring connection between the core and the casings at the ends where permanent connection is not arranged, it is possible to adapt impact force and shock interval to the prevailing conditions, i.e. to the ground nature and the material of the pile to be driven down into the ground. The rings 20 and 201, respectively, can be attached in different manners by means of screw connections, clamp connections or the like. It is important, however, that the ring is securely attached while it is at the same time possible to replace easily the ring. E g, the core 1Q can form a shoulder facing downwards at the lower end of the core, said shoulder surrounding the impact surface 11 axially spaced therefrom. The ring 2Q or 2Q can be attached to the shoulder by means of screws which are passed through the ring to engage threaded bores in the shoulder. The ring can also be attached to the casing 15 or the casing 19 as the case may be, by similar screw connections.
