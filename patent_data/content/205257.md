## Description
The present invention relates to a control system for an infinitely variable belt drive automatic transmission for a motor vehicle, and more particularly to a system for controlling the line pressure in a hydraulic circuit for the transmission. A known control system for an infinitely variable belt drive transmission disclosed in United States Patent No. 4,369,675 comprises an endless belt running over a drive pulley and a driven pulley. Each pulley comprises a movable conical disc which is axially moved by a fluid operated servo device so as to vary the running diameter of the belt on the pulleys in dependence on driving conditions. The system is provided with a line pressure control valve and a transmission ratio control valve. Each valve comprises a spool to control the oil supplied to the servo devices. The transmission ratio control valve operates to determine the transmission ratio in accordance with the opening degree of a throttle valve of an engine and the speed of the engine. The line pressure control valve is adapted to control the line pressure in accordance with the transmission ratio and the engine speed. The output of the engine is transmitted to the drive pulley through a clutch. The line pressure is controlled to prevent the belt from slipping on pulleys in order to transmit the output of the engine. On starting the vehicle, the transmission ratio is set at a maximum value. When the vehicle speed and engine speed reach set values under a particular driving condition, the transmission ratio starts to change to upshift . At that time if the engine speed is kept constant, the transmission ratio is automatically and continuously reduced at a speed which is decided by line pressure, pressure of oil supplied to the servo device of the drive pulley, and actual transmission ratio. In such a system, the speed of changing of transmisson ratio up to a desired transmission ratio cannot be controlled in accordance with driving conditions. Accordingly, hunting or overshoot of transmission ratio occurs, which causes the driveability of the vehicle to deteriorate. In addition, since the line pressure changes stepwisely, shocks occur during transmission ratio changes. Japanese Patent Laid Open 58 88252 discloses a control system provided with a torque motor for operating a line pressure control valve. Such a system is not practical, since a drive source for driving the torque motor must be provided. Japanese Patent Laid Open 59 159456 discloses a system provided with a first valve for changing the direction of the transmission ratio change and a second valve for controlling the transmission ratio changing speed. By controlling the spool of the second valve, the transmission ratio changing speed is controlled. However, the system is complicated in construction, since two control valves are provided in addition to the conventional system. Further, the publication does not disclose a system for controlling the changing speed of the line pressure. Accordingly the present invention seeks to provide a system which may smoothly operate a transmission ratio control valve and a line pressure control valve, thereby providing proper line pressure for smoothly changing the transmission ratio. Accordingly, the present invention provides a control system for an infinitely variable transmission for transmitting the power of an internal combustion engine, the system comprising a drive pulley and a driven pulley each having a hydraulically shiftable disc and a first hydraulic cylinder for shifting the disc, a drive belt engaged with both pulleys, a first spool valve for line pressure control, a second spool valve for transmission ratio control, a first hydraulic circuit having a pump for supplying oil to the first cylinder through the line pressure control valve and transmission ratio control valve, characterised by a second hydraulic circuit for supplying oil to the line pressure control valve so as to shift the spool control valve means provided in the second hydraulic circuit for controlling the amount of oil supplied to the line pressure control valve sensing means for sensing operating conditions of the engine and the transmission and for producing signals dependent on the conditions first means responsive to the signals from the sensing means for producing an output signal representing a desired line pressure second means responsive to the output signal for producing an operating signal for operating the control valve means, so that the shifting of the spool of the transmission ratio control valve is controlled to control line pressure. One embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Referring to Figure 1, the infinitely variable belt drive automatic transmission for a motor vehicle to which the present invention is applied, comprises an electromagnetic powder clutch 2 for transmitting the power of an engine 1 to transmission 4 through a selector mechanism 3. The belt drive transmission has a main shaft 5 and an output shaft 6 provided in parallel with the main shaft 5. A drive pulley primary pulley 7 and a driven pulley secondary pulley 8 are mounted on shafts 5 and 6 respectively. A fixed conical disc 7b of the drive pulley 7 is integral with main shaft 5 and an axially movable conical disc 7a is axially slidably mounted on the main shaft 5. The movable conical disc 7a also slides in a cylinder 9a coaxially mounted on the main shaft 5 to provide a servo device. A chamber 9 of the servo device communicates with a hydraulic circuit 20. A fixed conical disc 8b of the driven pulley 8 is formed on the output shaft 6 facing the movable conical disc 8a, which has a cylindrical portion which is slidably engaged in a cylinder 6a coaxially mounted on the output shaft 6 to form a servo device. A chamber 10 of the servo device also communicates with hydraulic control circuit 20. A drive belt 11 engages with the drive pulley 7 and the driven pulley 8. Secured to the output shaft 6 is a drive gear 12 which engages with an intermediate reduction gear 13 on an intermediate shaft 14. An intermediate gear 15 on the shaft 14 engages with a final reduction gear 16. The rotation of the final reduction gear 16 is transmitted to axles 18 of the vehicle driving wheels 19 through a differential 17. Referring to Figs. 2a to 2c, chamber 9 of the drive pulley 7 is supplied with pressurized oil by an oil pump 21 from an oil reservoir 26 passing through a line pressure conduit 22, ports 41a and 41e of a line pressure control valve 40, transmission ratio control valve 50, and conduit 23. The chamber 10 of driven pulley 8 is supplied with pressurized oil through a passage 22b which by passes valves 40 and 50. The movable conical disc 7a of the drive pulley 7 is so designed that the pressure receiving area thereof is larger than that of movable control disc 8a of the driven pulley 8. The line pressure control valve 40 comprises a valve body 41, spool 42, and ports 41c and 41d and chambers 41f and 41g. The spool 42 issupplied with pressure of the pressurized oil in a chamber communicating with port 41c supplied through a conduit 46. The spool 42 is urged to the left by the force of a spring 43 provided between the end of the spool and a retainer 45 the position of which is adjustable by a screw 44. The port 41a is connected with a port 41b of a drain passage 27 in accordance with the position of a land of the spool 42. The transmission ratio control valve 50 comprises a valve body 51, spool 52, spring 55 for urging the spool in the downshift direction. A port 51b of the valve body 51 is selectively communicated with a pressure oil supply port 51a or a drain port 51c in accordance with the position of lands of spool 52. Port 51b communicates with chamber 9 through a conduit 23, and port 51a communicates with line pressure control valve 40 through conduit 22a. The drain port 51c communicates with the oil reservoir 26 through a conduit 24 and check valve 25. The drain port 41b of the line pressure control valve communicates with oil reservoir 42 through conduit 27 and a lubricating oil pressure providing valve 28. The conduit 27 also communicates with conduit 23 through a check valve 30. A part of the oil in the conduit 27 is supplied to the pulley 8 from a nozzle 29 to lubricate the pulley device. The system of this embodiment of the present invention is provided with a pressure reducing valve or pressure control valve 60, and solenoid operated on off control valves 65 and 67. The pressure control valve 60 comprises a valve body 61, spool 62, ports 61a, 61b and 61c, end chamber 61d, and spring 63 urging the spool 62 to the chamber 61d. The load of the spring 63 can be adjusted by a screw 64. The port 61a is connected to the conduit 22 by a conduit 31 having an orifice 32, and ports 61b and 61d are connected to a conduit 33. When the pressure of the oil in the conduit 33 reduces, the spool 62 is shifted to the right by spring 63, so that port 61a communicates with port 61b to increase the pressure in the conduit 33. Thus, a constant pressure of oil is provided in the conduit 33. The conduit 33 communicates with the port 41d of line pressure control valve 40 through an orifice 34 and a passage 47. The conduit 33 also communicates with reservoir 26 through a solenoid operated on off valve 65 and with an accumulator 66. Further, the conduit 33 is connected an end chamber 51f of the port 51d of the transmission ratio control valve 50 through a passage 53 and with another end chamber 51g of the port 51e through a passage 54 having an orifice 35. A solenoid operated on off valve 67 is connected to the passage 54 downstream of orifice 35 so as to drain the oil to the reservoir 26. The solenoid operated valve 65 is adapted to be operated by pulses. When energized, a valve 65a opens a drain port 65b. The solenoid operated valve 67 is the same as valve 65 in construction and operation. The control valves 65 and 67 are operated by pulses from a control unit 70. Thus, pressures applied to ports 41d, 51e are controlled by changing the duty ratios of the pulse trains supplied to the control valves 65 and 67. In the line pressure control valve, the relationship between spring loads F Accordingly, the line pressure PL is proportional to the control pressure P In the transmission ratio control valve, the pressure receiving area of the spool 52 at chamber 51g is set to a value larger than the area at the chamber 51f. On the other hand, second control pressure P The relationship between the duty ratio D of pulses applied to the solenoid operated control valve 67 and the transmission ratio i is explained hereinafter. The transmission ratio changing speed di dt is a function of flow rate Q of oil supplied to the chamber 9, and the flow rate Q is a function of duty ratio D, line pressure PL and primary pressure P The line pressure PL is decided by the transmission ratio i and enginge torque, and the primary pressure P Accordingly, the duty ratio is determined by the transmission ratio changing speed di dt and the transmission ratio i. On the other hand, the transmission ratio changing speed di dt is dependent on the difference between the actual transmission ratio i and a desired transmission ratio id, di dt K id i where K is a coefficient Accordingly, if the transmission ratio changing speed di dt is decided, the duty ratio D can be obtained from the speed. When the actual transmission ratio i is larger than the desired transmission ratio id i id , the value of di dt is negative. In such a state, the duty ratio D is increased to reduce the pressure in the chamber 51g so as to upshift the transmission. The downshift is performed in the reverse manner. Referring to Figs. 3a and 3b, the system is arranged to control the transmission ratio in accordance with above described principle. In the system, a drive pulley speed sensor 71, driven pulley speed sensor 72, engine speed sensor 74 and throttle valve position sensor 73 are provided. Output signals N The speed di dt and actual ratio i are applied to a duty ratio table 79 to derive the duty ratio D of pulses for control valve 67. Fig. 5c shows the duty ratio table in which the duty ratio decreases with increases of speed di dt and ratio i. The duty ratio D is supplied to the solenoid operated valve 67 through a driver 80. On the other hand, an output signal Ne of the engine speed sensor 74 and throttle position signal are fed to an engine torque table 81 to derive engine torque T of Fig. 5d. On the other hand, actual ratio i is applied to a necessary line pressure setting section 82 which produces a necessary line pressure PL In operation, while the vehicle is stationary, chamber 10 of the driven pulley is supplied with line pressure through conduit 22b, and the chamber 9 of the drive pulley is drained, since the N At that time the line pressure is at the highest value determined by the pressure control valve 40, since the duty ratio D for the valve 65 is small, and the spool 42 of the control valve 40 is at the lefthand end position. When the throttle valve is opened for acceleration, the desired transmission ratio id and transmission ratio changing speed di dt are calculated by calculators 76, 78, and the duty ratio D is obtained from the table 79. The value of the duty ratio D is larger than the neutral value, so that the pressure in the chamber 51f of the control valve 50 is higher than in the chamber 51g. Thus, the spool 52 is shifted to the left to connect the port 51a with port 51b, so that oil is supplied to the chamber 9 through the conduit 23. On the other hand, duty ratio DP for the control valve 65 is increased, so that the pressure in the chamber 41g becomes low to shift the spool 42 of the valve 40 to the right. Accordingly, the port 41a communicates with the port 41b of the drain passage 27. Thus, line pressure reduces, and the transmission is upshifted, since oil is still supplied to the chamber 9 through the control valve 50. As the difference between the desired ratio id and actual ratio i becomes large, the duty ratio D for the control valve 67 becomes large, thereby increasing the transmission changing speed di dt. When the opening degree of the throttle valve is reduced for deceleration, the duty ratio D is reduced, thereby shifting the spool 52 to the right to drain the chamber 9. Thus, the transmission is downshifted. The transmission changing speed at downshifting increases with reducing of the duty ratio. In accordance with this embodiment of the present invention, since the line pressure is controlled to change continuously in accordance with a desired line pressure, the transmission ratio is smoothly changed in dependence on driving conditions of a vehicle. While the presently preferred embodiment of the present invention has been shown and described, it is to be understood that this disclosure is for the purpose of illustration and that various changes and modifications may be made within the scope of the appended claims.
