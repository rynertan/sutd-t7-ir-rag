## Description
Dynamic anaerobic equipment for waste water treatment The present invention relates to an equipment, which is able to operate1 by anaerobic way, waste water recovery treatments, such as the water purification, the mud stabilization or digestion and the nutrient removal. It is knows that the complete recovery of civil and industrial waste water is carried out through four con secutive treatments, o called primary, secondary, ter tiary and quaternary. The primary treatment consists in the separation of the water to be purified from the sedimentable solids, which settle onto the bottom of a tank or a sedimentation channel in the form of mud. The secondary treatment in its turn consists in a biological depuration of the water and is usually carried out by aerobic way, that is in the presence of oxy gen, for example by periodically immerging and extracting from the water through suitable rotating supports, a flora of microorganisms which are able, in the immer sion phase, to feed on polluting organic substances contained in the water and, in the emerging phase in contact with the oxygen of the air, to cause the biodegradation of the organic substances which have been caught and their consequent transformation into biological mud which can settle. The tertiary treatment in its turn consists in the elimination of the nutrient substances, such as phosphates and nitrates, and in the disinfection, usually carried out by ozono or hypochlorite. The quaternary treatment finally consists in ma king the water drinkable. A process associated to that of water recovery is represented by the stabilization or digestion of the residual mud, mainly produced by the primary or sedimentation treatment and by the secondary or biota gical depuration treatment. Such a process, intended as a transformation of the constitutive components of mud into elementary substan ces or stable chemical radicals destined to various uses, for example as fertilizers, has a particular im portance, since its development by anaerobic way, that is without oxygen, give rise to a gas mixture, in which the methane gas is predominant. The mud anaerobic digestion is to be considered as a process of biological and biochemical nature, to which microorganisms of anaerobic kind mainly take active part, even if microorganisms of other kind are not to be excluded. Said microorganisms operate on mud to be stabilized in such a way as to transform their organic substratum into methane and carbon dioxide, passing through some intermediate hydrolitic, acid methanic phases . The digestion process is also conditioned by various elements, such as PH, alkalinity, temperature, carbon nutrient ratio, toxic substances and so on. At present, the mud anaerobic digestion is executed in the inside of sealtight big tanks, where an agitator provides to keep in movement the solid liquid mass to aid the mixing thereof and to prevent, on the con trary, the stratification, that is the formation of solids digested mud on the tank bottom, the formation of slime and mud the so called scum1, at the sur face and the formation of a liquid layer the so called overfloating between solids and scum. It must therefore be underlined that the stratification, if it is to be avoided during the digestion process, on the other hand is convenient for the periodic extraction of the digested mud , of the scum and o fhe liquid overfloating to be recycled to the inlet of the water treatment equipment. The main object of the present invention is to rea lize an equipment able to execute the mud anaerobic digestion with increased efficiency with respect to the presently used systems. According to the invention, such an object is reached by a dynamic anaerobic equipment, characterized in that it comprises at least one treatment stage in cludin ,in the inside of a closed well periodically fed with the material to be treated, a rotating devi cc at least partially immtrgtd in said material and provided with at least one group of shaped paral Icl e laments which define parallel canalizations devtiop ping in the direction of rotation of the group. Said rotating device is preferably followEd by a rest zone, in which the stratification of the worked material is allowed. Besides the treatment stages can be two or more, arranged the one following the other in adjacent way. The equipment according to the invention allows a better and quicker digestion of the mud , with consequent improved stabilization and increased production of methane. This is due to the fact that the rotating device, which is a member of it, not only provides for mud mixing, but thanks to the wide contact area assured by the various canalizations with which it is provided and in which microorganisms stick to the walls of the shaped elements and the mud enter and exit in continuity allows also an increased, continuous and repeated biological and biochemical exchange between the anaerobic microorganisms mass or biomass and the mud in the digestion phase Besides it is to be noted that the equipment according to the invention not only leads itself to the mud digestion but also to the contemporaneous biological depuration of waste water or sewages and eventually to nutrient removal.Particularly, by introducing sewage that is polluted liquid plus substances in suspension plus substances which can settle into an equipment according to the invention, it is possible to obtain in a very satisfactory way both the anaero bic biological dt puration of the sewage with formation of biological mud and the stabilization of the above mentioned mud and of that settled for sedimentation.The final result is represented by stable mud and by the production of methane gas as in case of use as a simple stabilizer, and in addition by the formation of an ovcrfloating with vC ry redtlced polluting charge, which requests correspondingly reduced expenses and equipments for the completing of the depuration process. An exemplary embodiment of the equipment according to the invention is illustrated by exemplificative but not limitative way in the enclosed drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows in axial section, along line I l ofFig. 2 a two stage equipment which can be employed for mud stabilization, as well as for anaerobic depuration of sewages Fig. 2 shows said equipment as sectioned in plan along line Il Il of Fig. 1 Fig. 3 shows in enlarged perspective view one of the groups of shaped elements making part of the rotating devices included in the above mentioned equipment Fig. 4 shows the more enlarged detail, in transversal section, of a possible structure and mutual arrangement of the shaped elements which constitute the group of Fig. 3 Figs. 5 7 show alternative shapes and arrangements of said shaped elements. The equipment Illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2 includes two treatment stages situated the one following the o ther in the inside of a closed well 1, which can be laid partially or completely underground. A first stage includes a rotating device 2, followed by a rest zone 3 defined between two parallel vertical walls 4. The second stage is equal to the first one. The rotating device 2, whose constructive details are better shown in Figs. 3 7, comprises a plurality of groups of shaped elements, which are indicated in their assembly by the reference number 5 and are radially disposed Fig. 1 with respect to an horizontal drive shaft 6 operated by a motor 7 through a reduction unit 8 Fig. 2 . Every group 5, which can assume every desired shape in addition to the trapezoidal one illustrated in the drawings, is formed by a plurality of shaped elcmints 9 with trapezoidal shape as in Figs. 4 and 5 or with rectangular shape as in Figs. 6 and 7 , which ari disposed adjacent one another, perpendicularly to LI,, drive shaft 6, with either opposed concavities as inFigs. 4 and 6 or parallel concavities as in Figs. 5 and 7. In any case thty thus dtfinc a plurality of pa rallel canalizations 10 Figs. 4 7 which develop paral itily to the rotation direction of the device 2 and art open at both ends. As it appears evident from Fig. 3, the whole group of shaped elements 9 is situated between two end plates 11 and here retained by a pair of tie rods 12 reac ting between a pair of radial strips 13 situated outside the platts 11 and opportunely fixed to disks 14 in their turn fixed on tht shaft 6. During working, the rotating device 2 of the first stag. is rotated partially immerged in a bati, of mate rial to be worked 15, which is introduced into the well 1 through a feed mouth 16 provided with a suita ble closure not shown in the drawings . It is therefore possible to provide for its rotation in a condi tion of total immersion. In the bath there are also present suitable microorganisms of anaerobic kind, which, as a result of the rotation of the device 2,are inclined to enter the canalization 10 thereof and to stick to the walls of the shaped elements 9, thus forming a biomass. If the equipment is used as a simple mud stabilizer so that the bath 15 is formed exclusively by mud settled during a primary treatment of settling and by biological mud produced during a secondary treatment of biological depuration, the above mentioned biomass continuously comes into contact with the mud which enter and exit from the canalizations 10 and by biological and biochemical reaction causes the progressive stabilization or digestion of the same. mud and the consequent production of mathanf. The latter can be extracted through mouths 17 provided with suitable closure and safety devices not shown in the drawings , while the partially worked mud, indicated with 22, set tie on the well bottom, under the rotating device of the first stage, or on the bottom of a following rest zone 3. In the latter, by stratification, there forms over the mud 22 the so called overfloating 19 and thereover the so called scum 18. Mouths 21 and 23 allow at tht right moment the extraction of desired quantities of mud and overfloating, which are introtiu ced in the second stage for a new cycle of stabiliza tion. The scum in its turn is extracted through a mouth 20. In the second stage the process is rtXpeatd in the same way, originating a further production of methane and a complete digestion of the mud. Further stages can possibly be provided for an improved digestion. If the equipment is used on the contrary for the depuration of sewages and the stabiLization of the re lative muds, so that the bath IS is formed by sewarres containing polluted liquid, substances in suspension and substances which can settle, the biomass attached to the walls of the shaped elements 9 produces also a biological depuration of the sewages, feeding on the polluting substances contained therein and causing the transformation thereof into mud of which the same biomass causes the stabilization.It is produced methane again and in the rest zones 3 the worked material bt comes stratified, creating between the scum and the di gested mud an overfloating at low polluting charge, which, if necessary, can then be brought to a complete depuration by equipments of low cost. It is to be noted that, whatever is the kind of use , the realization of the equipment according to the in vent ion in the form of a number of successive stages in wells of limited height and partially or totally laid underground offers various advantages with respect to the known digestors at independent tanks. The main advantages are the reduction of the manufacture costs, seeing the semplicity of the construction the reduction of the consumption of termic energy for the heating of the muds, deriving from the possi bility of laying the well underground the simplification of the feed of the material to be worked and of the discharge of the digested mud, as well as of the overfloating and of the scum separated stratification of the digestion a more simple control and regulation of PH and alkalinity bearing of a greater charge of toxic substances contained in the mud to be digested, without interference with the digestion and non polluting process.
