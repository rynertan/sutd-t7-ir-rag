# Capsule sealing method and apparatus.

## Abstract
A capsule sealing apparatus for use in conjunction with capsule filling equipment is disclosed which seals a two piece ingestable capsule. The sealing apparatus includes a chamber having nozzles for dispensing the contents of the chamber, the chamber being supplied with hot, moist air of controlled consistency, preferably being achieved by mixing a supply of steam and air in appropriate proportions. The average pressure of the chamber is maintained slightly below that of the ambient atmosphere which acts to prevent the hot, moist air from leaving the chamber through the nozzles. Apparatus is provided for causing a momentary increase in the pressure within the chamber, which increase delivers the hot, moist air from the chamber through the nozzles into cap members adjacent thereto. The caps thereafter telescopically receive a filled body member of the gelatin capsule, a bond forming between the cap member and body member of the capsule upon their being joined.
