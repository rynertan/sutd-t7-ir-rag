# Accelerator pedal control system for automotive vehicle.

## Abstract
In an accelerator control system including electrical elements or devices, if trouble occurs in these elements, the throttle valve 5 may be kept open in spite of the fact that the accelerator pedal 1 is fully released. To overcome the above problem, an accelerator pedal zero stroke detector 6 , a throttle valve initial position detector 7 and an abnor mality signal generator 8 are additionally provided for the accelerator control system, in order to generate an alarm signal or a system disabling signal when the throttle valve is kept open beyond a predetermined time interval after the accelerator pedal has been fully released.
