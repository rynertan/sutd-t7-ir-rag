# Process for esterifying 3,5 ditert butyl 4 hydroxybenzoic acid.

## Abstract
A process for making C₈ C₂₀ alkyl esters by esterification of 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzoic acid with a C₈ C₂₀ alcohol. The esterification reaction is conducted at 110 150 C in the presence of 5 20 weight percent based on the weight of 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxybenzoic acid, of a strongly acidic gel type ion exchange resin catalyst having less than about 8 per cent cross linking.
