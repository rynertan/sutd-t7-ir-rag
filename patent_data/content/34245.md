# Transducer carriage assembly.

## Abstract
A carriage assembly for holding a pair of opposite trans ducers 15OZ, 152Z in contact with the opposite sides of a flexible magnetic disk includes a swing arm 502, 506 for carrying each of the transducers. Respective E shaped leaf springs 504, 508 support the swing arms with respect to a carriage using the two outer legs of each of the springs which are substantially flat and unstressed when the transducers are in contact with the disk. The central legs of the E shaped springs are connected together so as to urge the swing arms and transducers together and allow the swing arms and transducers to be parted for the insertion of a disk into opera tive position. A gimbal spring and a loading spring support each of the transducers with respect to its associated swing arm. The gimbal springs, loading springs and E shaped springs are balanced with respect to each other so as to hold the transducers in light data transferring contact with the disk. The outer legs of the E shaped springs flex for low frequency undulations of the disk, and the loading springs and gimbal springs flex for high frequency undulations of the disk.
