# IMPROVED COOLING MEANS FOR TORQUE CONVERTER BYPASS

## Abstract
A bypass drive line 28 for a torque converter type automa tic transmission 11 in which the bypass drive line includes a viscous coupling 30 and automatic transmission fluid is selec tively passed through the periphery of the viscous coupling to provide a flow of cooling fluid around the coupling. The fluid flowing through the coupling enters at one face 32a of the coupling adjacent the periphery of the coupling and then flows around the periphery of the coupling through a plurality of separate elongated narrow passages and then exits at the opposite face 34a of the coupling. The passages are defined by a series of interconnected concentric peripheral grooves 32i, 32j, 32k, 32m defined within the coupling. In one disclosed embodiment, four separate circuit ous paths are provided through the coupling and in a second disclosed embodiment two separate circuitous paths are pro vided.
