# Method for optical resolution of 2 4 chlorophenyl 3 methyl butanoic acid.

## Abstract
A method for optical resolution of 2 4 chlorophenyl 3 methylbutanoic acid, which comprises crystallizing out the salt between or 2 4 chlorophenyl 3 methyl butanoic acid and diethylamine in a molar proportion of 2 1 predominantly from a supersaturated solution of the salt of 2 4 chlorophenyl 3 methylbutanoic acid with diethyl amine, collecting the crystallized salt and decomposing the collected salt under an acidic condition to obtain the corresponding optically active acid.
