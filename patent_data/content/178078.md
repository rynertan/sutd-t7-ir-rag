# Electrically controlled, progressive, frictional, torque transmitting device.

## Abstract
An electrically controlled, progressive, frictional, torque transmitting device comprises a rotary element 1, 2, a propor tion of the rotary power available from the rotary element 1, 2, being used, under the control of a direct electrical signal, to de termine the degree of engagement of a frictional device 3, and hence the torque transmitted or absorbed by the torque trans mitting device, thereby avoiding the requirement for an addi tional power source to activate the frictional device whole.
