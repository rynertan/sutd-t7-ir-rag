# Process for suspension polymerizing vinyl chloride.

## Abstract
A process for suspension polymerizing vinyl chloride in which vinyl chloride or a mixture of vinyl chloride and a monomer of polymer copolymerizable therewith is dis persed in an aqueous medium in a polymerization vessel and polymerized in suspension in the presence of an oil soluble polymerization initiator, wherein a ternary reaction product of furfural, a polyamine and a phenol is applied to the inner surfaces of the polymerization vessel or is added to the polymerization system to inhibit the formation of scale on the inner surface of the polymerization vessel.
