# Puffer type current interrupter.

## Abstract
The interruptor employs a pair of symmetric electrodes 36, 37 with contact bosses 36a, 37a provided on their confronting surfaces. An insulator nozzle 35 is arranged such that the throat section for providing a jet of arc blasting gas is located in the periphery of the bosses 36a, 37a . The electrode structure provides a uniform electric field be tween the electrodes 36, 37 , thereby gaining the break down voltage.
