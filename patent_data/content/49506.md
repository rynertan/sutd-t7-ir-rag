## Description
TITLE OF THE INVENTIONN CARBOXYALKYL DIPEPTIDES, A PROCESS FOR PREPARING AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION COMPRISING THE SAMEBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention in its broad aspects relates toN carboxyalkyl dipeptides and derivatives thereof which are useful as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and as antihypertensives.The compounds of this invention are represented by the following formula EMI1.1 whereinR and R5 are individually hydroxy, lower alkoxy, aralkoxy R1 is C18 alkyl substiatuted C15 alkyl in which the substituent is amino hydroxy acylamino such as acetylamino and benzoyl amino arylthio aryloxy aryl or heteroaryl ana substituted aralkyl or substituted heteroaralkyl in which the substituent is halo or dihalo amino aminoloweralkyl hydroxy loweralkoxy, or loweralkyl R2 is hydroxy, amino, alkoxy, aralkyloxy n is one, two or threeR3 is aryl, heteroaryl, cycloalkyl, aminoloweralkyl, aralkyl R4 is hydrogen or loweralkyl orR3 and R4 are joined to form a ring having the following formulae EMI2.1 wherein X and Y taken together are CH2CH2 , CH, S , CH2CH OR6, EMI3.1 wherein RS is as defined above R6 is hydrogen or loweralkyl p is 1, 2, or 3 W is a bond, CH2 , orC O and, Z is a bond, CH2 , or CH2CH2 and, the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The loweralkyl groups, except where noted otherwise, represented by any of the variables include straight and branched chain hydrocarbon radicals from one to six carbon atoms, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, t butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, or hexyl and the like. The aralkyl groups represented by any of the above variables have from one to three carbon atoms in the alkyl portion thereof and include for example, benzyl, phenethyl, and the like.Halo means chloro, bromo, iodo or fluoro. Aryl, where it appears in any of the radicals except where noted, represents phenyl, biphenyl, or naphthyl. Heteroaryl groups, where they appear, include for example, pyridyl, thienyl, furyl, indolyl, benzthienyl, imidazolyl and thiazolyl. Acylamino refers to loweralkanoylamino and aroylamino groups. Preferred are those compounds of Formula I wherein R and R5 are individually hydroxy, loweralkoxy, aralkoxy R1 is substituted C15 alkyl in which the substituent is amino, hydroxyl, acylamino, arylthio, aryloxy, aryl, or heteroaryl and, substituted aralkyl or substituted heteroaralkyl in which the substituent is halo, amino, hydroxy, or loweralkoxy R2 is hydroxy, alkoxy n is two or three and,R3 and R4 are joined to form a ring having the following formula EMI4.1 wherein X and Y taken together are CH2CH2 , 6 S , CH2CH OR6 6 CH2 S , CH2CH OR R is hydrogen, loweralkyl p is 1 or 2 W is a bond, or CH2 and,Z is a bond, CH2 , or CH2CH2 . Most preferred are compounds of Formula I wherein R and R5 are individually hydroxy, loweralkoxy, aralkoxy R1 is aralkyl or heteroaralkyl wherein the alkyl portions contain 1 3 carbon atoms and the aryl and heteroaryl groups may be substituted by halo or hydroxy R2 is hydroxy, alkoxy n is two or three and,R3 and R4 are joined to form a ring having the following formula EMI4.2 wherein X and Y taken together are CH2CH2 , CH2 S , CH2CH OR6 R6 is hydrogen, loweralkyl p is 1 W is CH2 and, Z is CH The preferred and most preferred compounds ofFormula I also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. The products of Formula I and the preferred subgroups can be produced by the following methods.Method I, Route 1 EMI5.1 Keto acid or ester II is condensed with dipeptide III in aqueous solution, optimally near neutrality, or in suitable organic solvent CH3CN for example in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride to give I. Alternatively, the intermediate Schiff base or enamine base may be catalytically reduced to yield product I, for example, by hydrogen in the presence of 10 palladium on carbon or of Raney nickel. The ratio of diasteriomeric products formed may be altered by choice of catalyst. When R and R5 are alkoxy or aralkoxy, they can be removed by hydrolysis to give I where R and R5 are On. However, these functions often confer pharmacological advantages to these drugs. Alternatively II can be condensed with an 2 amino acid IV R and R2 i OH . EMI6.1 EMI6.2 under the same conditions to yield substituted amino acid V. Subsequent coupling by known methods with amino acid derivative VI gives 1. The above methods encompass reactive group protection during the coupling reaction, for example, by N formyl, N t butoxycarbonyl and N carbobenzyloxy groups followed by their removal to yield I.Furthermore, the R function may include removable ester groups such as benzyl, ethyl, or t butyl. Condensing agents in this synthesis are typically those useful in peptide chemistry such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC or diphenylphosphoryl azide DPPA or V may be activated via the intermediacy of active esters such as that derived from l hydroxybenzotriazole. Also, synthesis of dipeptides III and dipeptide analogs IV are achieved by methods standard in peptide chemistry from starting materials which are known or which can be made by known methods from known starting materials. In products of general Formula I, the carbon atoms to which R1, R2 CO CH2 and R4 are 4 attached are asymmetric when R and R4 are not hydrogens. The compounds exist in diastereoisomeric forms or in mixtures thereof. The above described synthesis can utilize racemates, enantiomers or diastereomers as intermediates or as starting materials. When diastereomeric products result, they can be separted by conventional chromatographic or fractional crystallization methods. In general, the aminoacid part structures, i.e.,EMI7.1 of Formula I are preferred in the S configuration. The compounds of this invention form salts with various inorganic and organic acids and bases which are also within the scope of the invention. Such salts include ammonium sats, alkali metal salts like sodium and potassium salts alkaline earth metal salts like the calcium and magnesium salts, salts with organic bases e.g., dicyclohexylamine salts,N methyl D glucamine, salts with amino acids like arginine, lysine and the like. Also, salts with organic and inorganic acids may be prepared, e.g., HC1, HBr, H2S04, H3PO4, methanesulfonic, toluensulfonic, maleic, fumaric, camphorsulfonic. Non toxic physiologically acceptable salts are preferred, although other salts are also useful, e.g., in isolating or purifying the product. The salts may be formed by conventional means, as by reacting the free acid or free base forms of the product with one or more equivalents of the appropriate base or acid in a solvent or medium in which the salt is insoluble, or in a solvent such as water which is then removed in vacuo or by freeze drying or by exchanging the cations of an existing salt for another cation on a suitable ion exchange resin. The compounds of this invention inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme and thus block conversion of the decapeptide angiotensin I to angiotensin II.Angiotensin II is a potent pressor substance. Thus, blood pressure lowering can result from inhibition of its biosynthesis especially in animals and humans whose hypertension is angiotensin II related. Furthermore, converting enzyme degrades the vasodepressor substance, bradykinin. Therefore, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme may also lower blood pressure by potentiation of bradykinin. Although the relative importance of these and other possible mechanisms remains to be established, inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme are effective antihypertensive agents in a variety of animal models and are useful clinically, for example, in many human patients with renovascular, malignant and essential hypertension.See, for example, A. B. Atkinson and J. I. S. Robertson,Lancet ii 836 1979 and references therein. The evaluation of converting enzyme inhibitors is guided by in vitro enzyme inhibition assays. For example, a useful method is that of Y. Piquilloud, A.Reinharz and M. Roth, Biochem. Biophys. Acta, 206, 136 1970 in which the hydrolysis of carbobenzyloxyphenylalanylhistidinylleucine is measured. In vitro evaluations may be made, for example, in normotensive rats challenged with angiotensin I by the technique ofJ. R. Weeks and J. A. Jones, Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.Med., 104, 646 1960 or in a high renin rat model such as that of S. Koletsky et. al., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.Med., 125, 96 1967 . Thus, the compounds of this invention are useful as hypertensives in treating hypertensive mammals, includinq humans, and they can be utilized to achieve the reduction of blood pressure by formulating in compositions such as tablets, capsules or elixirs for oral administration or in sterile solutions or suspensions for parenteral administration. The compounds of this invention can be administered to patients in need of such treatment in dosages that will at least be pharmaceutically active. Thus, although the dose will vary depending on severity of disease, weight of patient and other factors which a person skilled in the art will recognize, the dosage range will be about 10 to 500 mg per patient which can be given several times a day. Also, the compounds of this invention may be given in combination with diuretics or other antihypertensives. Typically these are combinations whose individual per day dosages range from one fifth of the minimal recommended clinical dosages to the maximum recommended levels for the entities when they are given singly.To illustrate these combinations, one of the antihypertensives of this invention effective clinically in the range 50 500 milligrams per day can be effectively combined at levels ranging from 10 500 milligrams per day with the following antihypertensives and diuretics in dose ranges per day as indicated hydrochlorothiazide 10 100 mg , timolol 5 60 mg , methyl dopa 65 2000 mg , the pivaloyloxyethyl ester of methyl dopa 30 1000 mg , indacrinone and variable ratios of its enantiomers 25 150 mg and hydroxycyclohexyl ethyl 4 oxo 2 thiazolidinylS propyjlbenzoic acid 10 100 mg . In addition, the triple drug combinations of hydrochlorothiazide 10 100 mg plus amiloride 5 20 mg plus converting enzyme inhibitor of this invention 10 500 mg or hydrochlorothiazide 10 100 mg plus timolol 5 50 mg plus the converting enzyme inhibitor of this invention 10 500 mg are effective combinations to control blood pressure in hypertensive patients. The above dose ranges will be adjusted on a unit basis as necessary to permit divided daily dosage. Typically the compounds and combinations shown above are formulated into pharmaceutical compositions as discussed below. Accordingly, about 10 to 500 mg of a compound or mixture of compounds of Formula I or a physiologically acceptable salt is compounded with a physiologically acceptable vehicle, carrier, excipient, binder, preservative, stabilizer, flavor, etc., in a unit dosage form as called for by accepted pharmaceutical practice. The amount of active substance in these compositions or preparations is such that a suitable dosage in the range indicated is obtained. Illustrative of the adjuvants which may be incorporated in tablets, capsules and the like are the following a binder such as gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin an excipient such as microcrystalline cellulose a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, pregelatinized starch, alginic acid and the like a lubricant such as magnesium stearate a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin a flavoring agent such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen or cherry. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as fatty oil.Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain the active compound, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propyl parabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. Sterile compositions for injection can be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical practice by dissolving or suspending the active substance in a vehicle such as water for injection , a naturally occurring vegetable oil like sesame oil, coconut oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, etc. or a synthetic fatty vehicle like ethyl oleate or the like.Buffers, preservatives, antioxidants and the like can be incorporated as required. The following examples are illustrative of the invention and constitute especially preferred embodiments. As mentioned earlier, the preferred diastereomers of these examples can be isolated by column chromatography or fractional crystallization.
