# Improved hair drier.

## Abstract
A conduit 5 extends rearwardly from the main body 1 of the hair drier through a U shaped elbow portion 6 and then forwardly of and parallel to the main body 1 to terminate with an air inlet opening 7 located adjacent the air outlet opening 8 . In this manner air is sucked into the air drier in a position near the point where it is discharged. This avoids the necessity of separating and spreading the hair by hand during the hair drying operation.

## Claims
CLAIMS 1. An improved hair drier caqprising a main body 1 accarrncating heat irradiating means and a fan and their accessories, and a handle ex tending downwardly fran said main body 1 and provided with a switch 3 and a lever 4 for controlling said heat irradiating means and said fan, characterized in that a conduit 5 communicating with the interior of said main body 1 extends rearwardly thereof and is bent back to form a U shaped elbow portion 6 and then extends forwardly along said main body 1 to terminate with a front air inlet opening 7 located adjacent to an air outlet opening 8 extending forwardly of said main body 1 , said air inlet and outlet openings 7, 8 extending in the same direction. 2. An improved hair drier as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that an air regulating device 12 for regulating the flow of air into the interior of the hair drier is provided in the area 11 between the main body 1 and the adjacent initial portion of the conduit 5 . 3. An improved hair drier as claimed in claim 1, characterized in that said front air inlet opening 7 is arranged to receive an extension conduit 9 and said air outlet opening 8 is arranged to receive a mouthpiece 10 .

## Description
Improved hair drier In drying hair by hot air by means of a manual hair drier as at present available on the market it is customary to dissipate the humidity produced in the hair by the air coming aut during the drying operation, by separating and spreading the hair by hand or with a comb or brush while handling the hair drier with the other hand. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved hair drier by which the operation of separating and spreading the moist hair, which was hitherto carried aut by hand, a comb or brush, can be eliminated or at least substantially reduced. In fact, the improved hair drier according to the invention carries itself out this hair separating and spreading operation so that it iray be made only occasionally to facilitate hair drying, but is not indispensable, so that one hand of the operator may be left free, if desired, until the end of the drying operation. To achieve this object, the hair drier according to the invention comprises an air inlet tube extending parallel to the air outlet tube or mouthpiece, these two tubes extending close to each other in the same direction with the air inlet and outlet mouthpieces opening in opposite directions. This construction permits the hair to be separated and spread due to the force of the air sucked into the apparatus through the inlet tube and by the effect of the hot air expelled from the apparatus through the outlet mouthpiece where the expelled hot air leaves the apparatus and evaporates the humidity in the air, the inlet and outlet rtouthpieces being located close to each other. According to another advantageous feature of the invention, the air outlet tube may be provided upstream of the air heating and fan means with air flow regulating means which permits the volume of air sucked into the interior of the apparatus by the fan means to be adjusted. A preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described by way of example and with reference to the accompanying drawing in which the only Figure is a schematic side view of the hair drier according to the invention. The hair drier according to the invention may be used both by lady s and gentlnn s hairdressers as well as for private use. As shown in the drawing, the hair dresser coMprises a main body 1 in which canventional heat irradiating means and a fan with their accessories are aocrrrodated. The train body 1 is dos wardly provided with a handle 2 having a switch 3 and lever 4 for controlling the heat producing means and the fan. According to the invention a conduit 5 extends from the rear portion of the main body 1 and communicates with the interior thereof, this conduit 5 being bent into U shape to form an elbow portion 6 and then extending back along the main body up to the front portion thereof to terminate with a front air inlet opening 7 located adjacent an air outlet opening 8. The front air inlet opening 7 is arranged to receive an additianal extension conduit 9 and the air outlet opening 8 is arranged to receive a mouthpiece 10. In the area 11, where the conduit 5 carmunicates with the mainbocy 1, there is provided an air regulating device which in the illustrated embodiment comprises a sleeve 12 provided with openings 13 and rotatably mounted on the conduit 5 which in this area is likewise provided with openings so that by rotating the sleeve 12 the conduit 5 can be brought into communication with the ambient air or this communication can be closed or regulated. In the first case the apparatus sucks in air only through the openings 13 and not through the inlet opening of the conduit 5, in the second case air is sucked in both through the openings 13 and the inlet opening of the conduit 5, and in the third case the openings 13 are closed and air is sucked in only through the inlet opening of the conduit 5. Although a preferred embodiment of the invention has thus been described, it is to be understood that minor structural changes may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.
