## Description
The present invention relates to the chromosomal DNA sequence coding for human interferon γ hereinafter referred to as HuIFN γ which is ligated to a promoter sequence that enables the IFN γ to be expressed in animal cell cultures, to cell cultures transformed with said DNA sequence, and to a method for the production of HuIFN γ using said transformed cell cultures. Interferon hereinafter referred to as IFN was, at first, discovered as a virus inhibiting substance, but thereafter was shown to be a substance that bears various biological and immunological activities. From fairly long ago, IFN was known to be effective in inhibiting cell proliferation Rubin, B.Y. et al 1980 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, According to differences in physiological,biochemical and immunological properties of the proteins, or the producing cells and in the induction mechanisms, HuIFNs are classified into three groups, which are called IFN α, IFN β, and IFN γ,respectively Stewart II,W.E. et al. 1980 Nature, Among others, IFN γ has the ability to inhibit cell proliferation at much lower concentrations than IFN α and IFN β Rubin,B.Y.et al. 1980 Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci. USA, HuIFN γ is known to be induced in human lymphocytes stimulated by phytohemaagglutinin,staphylococcal enterotoxin A,concanavalin A,or galactose oxidase Wheelock,E.F. 1965 Science, HuIFN γ was also produced by cloned T cell lines Nathan, H. et al. 1981 Nature, On the other hand, production of HuIFN γ was also attempted using animal cell cultures in which the simian virus 40 hereinafter referred to as SV40 promoter sequence had been ligated to the IFN γDNA sequence Gray, P.W. et al. 1982 Nature, It has been known that many proteins of higher organisms are encoded by chromosomal DNA sequences in the form of splitted sequences. The DNA sequences which encode mature messenger RNA are called exons, and the intervening sequences are introns. Although there are still unclear points as to the biological significance and function of intron, it has been known that far less ovalbumin Wickens, M.P. et al 1980 Nature, Removing intron sequences from the primary RNA transcribed from a gene is called splicing. The splicing is supposed to be a process necessary for the accumulation of stable mRNA or the transfer of mRNA from nucleus to cytoplasm. Therefore, it is supposed that the addition of viral introns to the intron free cDNA sequence of HuIFN γ leads to the intracellular accumulation of mRNA in the producing methods referred to above. As shown in Fig. 1, the HuIFN γ gene is composed of four exons, three introns, and two sequences adjacent to the 5 side and the 3 side Gray, P.W. et al. 1982 Nature, Whereas, in general, splicing of introns at correct sites is essential for the expression of normal and functional proteins, an unusual splicing was found when the insulin gene and the promoter region of SV40 were combined and introduced into COS cells Laub, O. et al. 1983 J. Biol. Chem., HuIFN γ is a glycoprotein. The structure of the sugar chain of HuIFN γ is still unclear in many respects. For example, it is unknown whether there are differences between sugar chains of HuIFN γ produced by cells of organisms other than human and HuIFN γ produced in human cells in their structure and antigenic properties. The HuIFN γ produced by human cells however is thought to be the same as the natural one, and to be higher in safety than those produced by cells of organisms other than human. The latter may cause problems such as allergic and shock reactions during the long term therapeutic administration, since their preparations are possibly contaminated with components such as protein or the like or secretions from the parent organisms. In contrast, preparations of the IFN γ produced by human cells never substantially contain any substance other than the human components, that is, substances intrinsically existing in the human blood. For these reasons, a high safety is expected for products derived from human cells. For establishing human cell cultures producing HuIFN γ, the cell can be tranformed by an HuIFN γ expression vector. Such transformed cells, however, are killed by the self produced HuIFN γ since this generally has a strong toxicity against human cells. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to isolate transformed strains which can be subcultured. Thus, whereas transformed strains which are able to be subcultured and to produce HuIFN γ can be easily obtained from hamster cells, transformed strains which are able to be subcultured are difficult to obtain from human cell cultures. Most cells have a tendency to stick to vessel walls. Even if cultured under mechanical agitation of the culture medium, cells having such a tendency do not proliferate to separate off springs, but yield cell floculations. The floculations are uneven in size, and result in an uneven cell density in the culture medium. In addition, because of difficulties in controlling the agitation conditions when the agitation is mild, cells exhibit a greater tendency to stick. If, on the other hand, the agitation is too strong the cells may be damaged. Based on the above background, the Present inventors isolated chromosomal DNA coding for HuIFN γ, and prepared plasmids in which the HuIFN γ gene is ligated to a promoter sequence that functions in animal cells, for example, SV40 early promoter, SV40 late promoter, or thymidine kinase promoter of herpes simplex virus. Further these plasmids were attached to a selective marker gene, for example, Ecogpt. The resulting plasmids, for example, pSVeSmaIγ, pSV2pTKγ, pSV2Lγ and pSV3Lγ were introduced into various animal cells according to the calcium phosphate method or the cell fusion method. It was found that in the obtained transformed cell lines the introduced human chromosomal DNA sequences were normally transcribed normally spliced and translated. Sugar chain bearing active HuIFN γ was secreted. Furthermore, the inventors for the first time obtained subculturable transformed cell lines using HuIFN γ resistant cell cultures derived from humans, or HuIFN γ resistant mutants. It is thought that, basically, subculturable HuIFN γ producing cell lines can be derived from any sort of cell cultures derived from humans, and that, consequently natural type HuIFN γ is high in safety. In addition, the inventors succeeded in separating HuIFN γ producing strains by transformation of cell lines derived ,from blood cells. These are proliferable as separate cells which do not substantially stick to vessel walls during cultivation and hardly yield cell floculations. These HuIFN γ producing cell lines can be readily submitted to suspension culture processes for carrying out a large scale culture. The present invention provides a means for the large scale production of highly safe HuIFN γ. Figure 1 displays a restriction map of the 8.6Kb BamHI fragment which contains the HuIFN γ gene. Figure 2 shows the plasmid pBRγ8.6 1. Figure 3 shows the plasmids pSV2γ8.6 1 and pSV2γ8.6 2. Figures 4 a and 4 b schematically show the construction of an expression vector, pSVeSmaIγ, capable of producing HuIFN γ in mammalian cell cultures. Figs. 5 7 schematically show the construction of the expression vectors pSV2pTKγ, pSV2Lγ and pSV3Lγ, respectively, which are capable of producing HuIFN γ in mammalian cell cultures. Figures 8 a and 8 b are schematic outlines of a process for preparing the expression vector pSVeBPVγ. When human chromosomal DNA is cleaved with the restriction enzyme BamHI, the gene region which codes for HuIFN γ is contained within a DNA fragment of about 8.6kb, as shown in Fig. 1. Exons of HuIFN γ are present at four places separately. These exons on the DNA sequence are referred to as the first to fourth exon in order from the 5 side, respectively each indicated by a thick line in Fig. 1 . On the sequences of the 5 side adjacent to the first exon, there is a regulatory site which controls the expression of HuIFN γ. The fourth exon has the signal AATAAA for polyadenylation of mRNA, following the termination codon. The first exon codes for a polypeptide which is composed of 38 amino acid residues. Twenty three 23 N terminal amino acids, which arise from the protein synthesis initiating amino acid, methionine,form a signal peptide, which is present at the N terminus of many secretory proteins. The signal peptide is cleaved off during secretion from the cell. The chromosomal DNA sequence which codes for HuIFN γ is the DNA sequence which contains the 4 exons and 3 introns shown in Fig. 1. The chromosomal DNA sequence which codes for HuIFN γ is cloned from the human DNA. The human DNA is prepared by the method of Blin et al. Blin, N. et al. 1976 Nucleic Acids. Res., The amino acid sequence of HuIFN γ can be derived from the base sequence of the exon parts of the cloned HuIFN γ gene. The base sequence, in turn, can be determined according to the Maxam Gilbert method Maxam A.M. et al. 1980 Methods in Enzymology, For the purpose of selective proliferation of the cells in which the desired gene is introduced and stably expressed, a DNA sequence composed of HuIFN γ sequence ligated to a functional promoter sequence, and a selectable marker gene, is appropriate. As the selectable marker in animal cells, such genes as Ecogpt Mulligan, R.C. et al. 1980 Science, As a promoter which functions in animal cell cultures, the SV40 early promoter is known. This promoter is contained by the Hind III Pvu II fragment of SV40 DNA about 350 base pairs in size and has an activity as SV40 late gene promoter in the opposite orientation. The thymidine kinase promoter of type 1 of herpes simplex virus HSV is a constitutive promoter similarly to SV40 early promoter. The structure has been shown by Wagner et al. Wagner, M.J. et al. 1981 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, For preparing a large amount of the DNA HuIFN γexpression vector sequence in which the sequence of the functional promoter region is ligated to the HuIFN γ chromosomal DNA sequence,it is desirable that such a DNA is a plasmid or a phage DNA which can be replicated in Escherichia coli. PlasmidspSVeSmaIγ, pSV2pTKγ, and the like which are described in examples 4 to 8 meet the above conditions. In other words,any of these plasmids is characterized in that its DNA sequence comprises the origin of DNA replication ori of Escherichia coli and of the animal cell cultures, the HuIFN γ chromosomal DNA sequence ligated to a functional promoter, and a selectable marker gene in Escherichia coli Ampicillin resistance gene and in animal cell cultures Ecogpt . For the introduction of DNA into animal cell cultures, such methods as the calcium phosphate method Wigler,M.et al. 1977 Cell, It is known that the mRNA synthesis from the SV40 late promoter is increased in the presence of the SV40 T antigen Keller, J.M. et al. 1984 Cell, For the production of HuIFN γ by cells into which a DNA sequence containing the chromosomal HuIFN γ gene ligated to a functional promoter, is introduced, it is necessary that said DNA sequence is fitted for the RNA synthesis system inherent in the cells to be used, the maturation system of RNA, the protein synthesis system, the maturation system of protein, as well as for functions as secretion and the like. In addition for the synthesis of mRMA from the introduced DNA, it is necessary that capping at the 5 end, splicing at normal sites, and polyadenylation of the 3 end of the mRNA take place. Furthermore, for expression of active IFN, it is necessary that higher order structures of the IFN peptide to be synthesized are formed and maintained, that the signal peptide is precisely cleaved off and that the resulting peptide is secreted from the cell. The inventors investigated different animal cell strains available from the American type culture collection ATCC . The cells were derived from hamster, monkey, mouse, rat or human, including CHO hamster ovary cells , HeLa human cerevicitis tumor cells , FL human amnion cells , WISH human amnion cells , Chimp liver chimpanzee liver cells , WI 26VA4 human lung cells transformed by SV40 , and Vero kidney cells of African green monkey . It is also possible to use other cells, hybridomas, normal and variant cells at least derived from vertebrates, and cells transformed by virus for the production of HuIFN γ according to the present invention. Further improvements of safety of products from the cell lines transformed by SV40 are expected in comparison with the cell lines with an unaccountable malignancy provided that proper means are taken. As a transformant by SV40, WI 26 VA4 is known. For selecting HuIFN γ resistant cell lines or HuIFN γ resistant variants out of many cell cultures derived from human subcultivation of culture cells in a medium containing HuIFN γ by one unit to several ten thousand units is useful. Whereas HuIFN γ sensitive culture cells derived from human are denatured, deformed, and finally killed by the toxicity of HuIFN γ during the subcultivation, the HuIFN γ resistant cell lines are not affected, but continue to grow. The latter therefore are easily selectable. In addition, HuIFN γ sensitive lines become significantly sensitive to a double stranded RNA as poly I C. When being treated with HuIFN γ the cells are denatured markedly and killed when being cultured in a medium containing poly I C. Thus the HuIFN γ resistant cell lines are distinguishable from these HuIFN γ sensitive cell lines. Established cell lines of mammals are derived from blood cells as lymphoblasts, myeloblasts, monocytes and erythroblasts which are derived from their stem cells. Additionally cell lines were established from cells which are further differentiated or derived from said blastocytes. The established cells derived from blood cells which have been proliferated in a common medium display spherical morphology and are suitable for suspension cultures. Some of these cells, namely those producing globulin are advantageously used as hosts for the production of HuIFN γ, because they have high ability to synthesize and secrete proteins. The inventors investigated different animal cell cultures derived from blood cells, which were obtained from the ATCC, including MOPC 31C plastocytoma_, MPC 11 myeloma , MB III lymphosarcoma , RBL 1 leakemic basophilic granulocyte , RPMI 7666 lymphoblastoid , MOLT 3 acute lymphoblastic leukemia , L1210, CCRF CEM, or EL4, U937, and X63 Ag8.653. They can produce HuIFN γ active in established cells, hybridomas, normal and variant cells at least derived from mammalian blood cells, and cells transformed by virus, provided that the manufacturing methods described in the specifications of the invention are employed. It was found that cells which were obtained to produce HuIFN γ by the introduction of HuIFN γ chromosomal DNA sequence ligated to a functional promoter by, for example, the calcium phosphate method or the cell fusion method, can produce HuIFN γ not only in a medium containing serum, but also in quite serum free medium. The use of serum free medium for production of HuIFN γ makes the recovery and purification of HuIFN γ from the medium easier. Well known methods are applicable for the recovery and purification of HuIFN γ from medium. For example, IFN can be recovered by adsorption to controlled pore glass Elecronucleonics Corp. , washing with PBS 0.15M NaCl 0.15M phosphoric acid buffer pH 7.4 , elution with PBS containing polyethylene glycol by 50 , further adsorption to ConA Sepharose, elution with phosphoric acid buffer containing 0.15M NaCl and 0.15M α methyl D mannoside, and finally by passing it through Biogel P 100. The activity of IFN was determined with the CPE inhibiting method with the combined use of FL cells and vascular stomatitis virus or sindovis virus Philip, C. et al. 1981 Methods in Enzymology, Various experiments which were relevant to the invention and described in the Examples given below, were carried out in accordance with the Japanese Guideline on Recombinant DNA prescribed by the Prime Minister. Detailed manipulations of phages, plasmids, DNA, various enzymes and Escherichia coli in Examples were performed by reference to the following jounals or books Blood samples were taken from several healthy adults, and, after collecting the buffy coat, hemolysed by adding about ten fold volume of 0.83 NH₄Cℓ. The sample was washed with Eagle s MEM medium to obtain leucocytes. Ten billion 10¹⁰ leucocytes were shaken with 50 ml of a solution containing 0.5M EDTA, 0.5 sarcosyl, and 100 µg ml protease K for 3 hours at 50 C to be dissolved. The obtained solution was extracted with phenol three times, and the aqueous layer was dialysed against 20mM tris. HCℓ pH 8.0 , 10mM EDTA, and 10mM NaCℓ. The dialyzate was treated with 100 µg ml ribonuclease for 3.5 hours at 37 C, again extracted with phenol, and dialysed against 20mM tris HCℓ pH 8.0 , 1mM EDTA, and 10mM NaCℓ to obtain about 33 mg of high molecular human DNA. The human DNA was digested with the restriction enzyme BamHl, and then BamHl DNA fragments of about 8 to 9 kilobases hereinafter abbreviated to kb were prepared with sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Lambda λ phage vector charon 28A DNA Bethesda Research Laboratories, Gaithersburg, USA was digested with BamHl, and the fractions containing the left arm and right arm of Charon 28 were collected with sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and recovered by ethanol precipitation The DNA fragments with both arms of Charon 28 and the human BamHl fragments of 8 to 9 kb were ligated together using T4 DNA ligase. Then, the ligated DNA was submitted to an in vitro packaging technique according to the Enquist Sternberg method Enquist, L. and N. Sternberg 1979 Methods in Enzymol., Four phage clones, S8 11 S18 6, S19 5 and S20 1 to be hybridized with all of used three synthetic DNA probes were obtained out of about two million recombinant phages. DNA was prepared from the respective phage clones, and digested with the restriction enzyme BamHl. As a result, DNA fragments of about 8.6 kb proved to be contained by each phage clone. Furthermore, by the restriction enzyme analysis, and the analysis of DNA sequences mentioned later, the selected four recombinant phage clones were identified as those containing HuIFN γ BamHl fragments of 8.6 kb. DNA of phage clone S8 11 containing HuIFN γ gene was digested with the restriction enzyme BamHl, and ligated to a BamHl site of plasmid pBR322 which had been treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase Bolivar, F. et al. 1977 Gene, The plasmid pBRγ8.6 1 was digested with BamHl, DNA fragments of about 8.6 kb were prepared by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated to the plasmid pSV2gpt ATCC 37145 which had been treated with bacterial alkaline phosphatase with the use of T4DNA ligase and transformed to Escherichia coli C600γ m . Strains bearing the plasmids pSV2γ8.6 1 and pSV2γ8.6 2, whose structure are shown in Fig. 3, were selected from among other transformants. plasmids pSV2γ8.6 1 and pSV2γ8.6 2 are plasmids into which the HuIFN γ gene bearing DNA fragment has been inserted clockwise and counterclockwise into the BamHl sites of pSV2gpt, respectively. Respective plasmid DNA was prepared by cesium chloride density equilibrium centrifugation. Plasmid DNA was prepared as needed with the use of Escherichia coli GM33 dam as a host. The Plasmid pSVeSmaIγ which has the sequence of SV40 promoter region and ligated chromosomal DNA sequence of HuIFN γ, is prepared according to the procedures shown in Figs. 4 a and 4 b , with the use of pBR8.6 1, pSV2gpt and pSV3gpt ATCC37144 Mulligan, R.C. and P. Berg 1980 Science, First, pSV3gpt ATCC37144 was digested with Hind III, and the largest DNA fragment was made cyclic with T4 DNA ligase to make pH1. Next, the Pvu II site of pH1 was changed into the Sal I site with the use of Sal I linker to make pH2. Further, the Hind III site of pH2 was changed to the Sma I site with the use of Hind III Sma I adaptor to make pHSmaI. psv2gpt was digested with Bam HI, The termini were filled to make blunt ends with DNA polymerase I klenow . A Sal I site was introduced with the use of Sal I linker and T4DNA ligase to make PSI. The PSI was digested with Sal I and EcoRI, and an ampicillin resistance gene bearing DNA fragment was ligated to the Sal I EcoRI fragment of pHSmaI having SV40 promoter region to make pSVeSmaI. Next, pBRγ8.6 1 was digested with Mst II, and, after the termini were made blunt with DNA polymerase Klenow , digested with BamHI to obtain HuIFN γ sequence bearing DNA fragment. The DNA fragment was introduced into pSVeSmaI which was digested with SmaI and BamHI, to make pSVeSmaIγ. Plasmid pSV2pTKγ which has the sequence of thymidine kinase promoter region of herpes simplex virus type I and the HuIFN γ gene, is prepared according to the procedures shown in Fig. 5, with the use of pBRγ8.6 1, pHSV106 Bethesda Research Laboratories, Gaithersburg, USA Mcknight, S.L. and E.R. Gabis 1980 Nucleic Acids Res., Sal I linker and Sma I adaptor used were d pGGTCGACC and d pAGCTCCCGGG , respectively. Employed DNA polymerase I was Klenow fragment. A HuIFN γ expression vector, pSV2Lγ was prepared according to the following procedures. Plasmid pSV2gpt Mulligan, R.C. and P. Berg 1980 Science, After treatment with the restriction enzyme Bcl I, the DNA fragment was recovered by 0.8 agarose gel electrophoresis. The recovered DNA fragment was circularized with the use of T4 DNA ligase to obtain pSV2gptBclI by transformation of E. coli GM33 dam . The pBR 8.6 1 described in Example 2 was digested with the use of Bam HI and Bcl I. HuIFN γ gene bearing DNA fragment of 5.5 kb was recovered, and inserted into the Bcl I site of pSV2gptBclI to obtain pSV2Lγ. The preparation of pSV2Lγ is shown in Fig. 6. The plasmid pSV2Lγ described in Example 5 was digested with restriction enzymes Pvu I and Bgl II, and a HuIFN γ gene containing DNA fragment of about 7.8 kb was recovered by 0.8 agarose gel electrophoresis. The recovered fragment was ligated to another DNA fragment which contained SV40 T antigen of pSV3gpt Mulligan, R.C. and P. Berg 1980 Science, The plasmid pSVeSmaIγ described in Example 4 was digested with the restriction enzymes Sal I and Bam HI to obtain a DNA fragment of about 6.0 kb which contained HuIFN γ gene bearing SV40 early promotor. On the other hand, pdBPV 1 ATCC 37134 Sarver, N. et al. 1982 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, For the purpose to investigate the expression of HuIFN γ gene of pSVeSmaIγ or pSVpTKγ, the plasmid was introduced into varied animal cell cultures in accordance with procedures of Wigler et al. Wigler et al. 1977 Cell, The medium of CHO cells into which pSVeSmaIγ or pSV2pTKγ had been introduced in Example 8, was replaced by an MEM medium which contains 10 FCS, 25 µg ml mycophenolic acid, and 250 µg ml xanthine. Then, mycophenolic acid resistant strains were separated therefrom, respectively. Each mycophenolic acid resistant strain was grown confluently in 24 well multidish, then cultured for 24 hours with 5 FCS containing MEM medium, and with quite FCS free MEM medium, respectively, and the IFN activities of the respective media were determined. Isolated cell lines produced IFN regardless of the existence of serum or not as follows Mycophenolic acid resistant CHO cells, CHO 33, were isolated by the procedures mentioned in Example 9, and cultured in an MEM medium to obtain 120 ml of culture liquid. Then, 1.0 g of Controlled Pore Glass CPG350 Electronucleonics Corp. mesh size 120 200 was added to 60 ml of the obtained culture liquid, agitated for 3 hours at 4 C, packed into a column, washed with 150mM phosphate 0.15M NaCℓ buffer pH 7.4 , and eluted by the same buffer which, in addition, contained 50 ethylene glycol. The active fraction was diluted 10 fold with 20mM phosphate buffer, passed through a 5 ml ConA Sepharose Column to get IFN adsorbed. Then the adsorbed IFN was eluted with 20mM phosphate buffer containing 0.15M NaCℓ and 0.15M α methyl D mannoside. The active fractions were collected, dialyzed against 0.2M ammonium acetate pH 6.0 and 0.15M NaCℓ, concentrated by polyethylene glycol 20000, and passed through Biogel P 100 2.6 x 60cm which had been equilibrated with the same buffer to obtain an IFN sample. The obtained IFN sample lost its activity on treating with acid of pH 2.0 or with 0.1 SDS. In testing the sensitivity promoting effect of the purified IFN on the cytotoxicity of poly I C, the promoting effect was observed only for human cells. In fact, cells were grown in monolayer on a 24 hole multidish, treated with IFN at 300 units ml for 20 hrs, and then cultured for 24 hours in an MEM medium containing 10 µg ml poly I C. While CHO and BHK hamster cells underwent no changes, cells of FL, WISH and Hela were observed to become round and exfoliated. For the purpose to investigate the expression of HuIFN γ gene contained in pSV2Lγ and pSV3Lγ, the plasmid was introduced into animal cell cultures in accordance with the procedures of Wigler et al. Wigler et al. 1977 Cell, Further, the concurrent introduction of pSV2Lγ and pSV3gpt, containing the SV40 T antigen coding gene, exhibited a 8 to 15 times higher activity than the single introduction of pSV2Lγ. WI 26 VA4 continuously expresses SV40 T antigen, and exhibites higher expression than CHO Kl. The medium of CHO Kl cells into which pSV3Lγ had been introduced in Example 11, was replaced by MEM medium which contained 10 FCS, 25 µg ml mycophenolic acid, and 250 µg ml xanthine. Then, mycophenolic acid resistant cells were isolated therefrom, respectively. Mycophenolic acid resistant cells were grown confluently in 24 well multidish, then cultured for 24 hours with 5 FCS containing MEM medium, and with quite FCS free MEM medium, respectively, and the IFN activities involved in respective media were determined. Five 5 cells out of separated 35 cells secreted 188 units ml. or more IFN into the medium including the one secreting more than 1500 units ml. By cultivating the latter cell in a FCS free medium, 150 units ml IFN containing culture medium was obtained. HuIFN γ yielding CHO cells obtained in Example 12 were cultured for 4 days in a 5 FCS containing MEM medium, and 60 ml of the medium was recovered therefrom. To the recovered culture medium, 0.5 g of Controlled Pore Glass Electronucleonics Corp. CPG350 meshsize 120 200 was added, agitated for 3 hours at 4 C, filled into a column, washed with 150mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and 0.15M NaCℓ, and eluted with the same buffer containing 50 ethylene glycol. Then the obtained active fractions were diluted 10 fold with 20mM phosphate buffer. Thus, about 20 000 units of IFN was purified and recovered. First,7.2µg of PSVeSPV was introduced into CHO kl cells and mouse cells C127I in accordance with the method of Wigler et al. Wigler et al. 1977 Cell, In another way,a strain transformed through 2 week cultivation was sub planted to a 96 well multidish at a rate of 200 µl medium well,and cultured for 3 days.As a result, transformed strains which had activities of 750 units ml for CHO Kl,and 1500 units ml for c 127,respectively,were obtained. Cell cultures of human origin such as HeLa,FL,WISH, and WI 26 VA 4, were cultured for 24 hours using a 24 well multidish plate in an MEM medium which contained 100 units ml HuIFN γ and 5 FCS. After removing the culture liquid, the cultured cells were washed with PBS one time,added to with MEM buffer containig 10 µg ml poly I C,and further cultivated at 37 C. After 16 to 24 hours,it was observed that cells of HeLa, FL and WISH were got round and exfoliated from the plate bottom,but cells of WI 26 VA4 were not. This finding suggests that WI 26 VA4 cells are resistant to HuIFN γ. FL cells were cultured on the whole bottom surface of 75 cm² of a flask. Then the culture was renewed by an MEM medium which contained 100 units ml HuIFN γ, and 10 µg ml poly I C, and still incubated for 48 hours. Although most of FL cells were exfoliated from the bottom, the medium was replaced by another MEM medium containing 100 units ml HuIFN γ, and still incubated for about one month. Colonies of HuIFN γ resistant FL cells were developed, proliferated, and established. The pSVeSmaIγ or pSV2pTKγ which had been prepared so as to express HuIFN γ in Example 4, or the pSV2gpt which had no HuIFN γ gene, was introduced into the HuIFN γ sensitive HeLa, FL or WISH cells, or the HuIFN γ resistant WI 26VA4 cells, and the HuIFN γ resistant FL cells in accordance to the calcium phosphate method Wigler et al. 1977 Cell, The colonies of WI 26 VA4 transformant obtained in Example 17 using pSveSmaIγ or pSV2pTKγ were separated, and proliferated in an MEM medium containing 5 FCS. The transformant was proliferated on the whole bottom surface of the 24 well multiplate. After the medium was renewed, and incubated for 24 hours, the IFN activity in the culture liquid was determined. The IFN activities of 32.3 and 524 units 24 hr 10⁶ cells were observed for transformants by pSVeSmaIγ and pSV2pTKγ, respectively. In addition, using 1.44 µg of pSV2γ8.6 1, pSV2pTKγ or pSVeSmaIγ, WI 26 VA4 strain was transformed in a similar way to that in Example 17. The obtained results are as follows. The colonies of HuIFN γ resistant FL transformant obtained in Example 17 using pSV2pTKγ were separated, and proliferated in an MEM medium containing 5 FCS. The transformant was proliferated on the whole bottom surface of the 24 well multiplate. After the medium was renewed, and incubated for 24 hours, the IFN activity in the culture liquid was determined. The development of the activity of 3 units 24 hr 10⁶ cells was observed. The pSVeSmaIγ described in Example 4 was introduced into blood cell derived cell lines obtained from ATCC or others according to the method of Oi, et al. Oi, V.T. et al. 1980 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, The medium of MOPC 31C cells into which pSVeSmaIy had been introduced by the protoplast fusion method in Example 20, was replaced by a DMEM medium which contained 10 FCS, 25 µg ml mycophenolic acid, 250 µg ml xanthine, 5 µg ml thymidine, 0.1 µg ml aminopterin, and 25 µg ml adenine, and further cultured for 3 to 4 weeks, and mycophenolic acid resistant cell colonies were isolated therefrom. Each of the mycophenolic acid resistant cells Was cultured on the whole bottom surface of a 24 well multidish, and further cultured with 5 FCS containing or FCS free DMEM medium for 48 hours, and the IFN activity in the medium was determined. As shown below, the isolated cell lines proved to produce IFN regardless of the presence or absence of serum. Similarly, both MPC 11 and EL4 transformed lines produced IFN.
