## Description
COUPLED HYDROCARBON POLYMERS AND PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION It is known that alkadienes as well as monovinylarenes can be polymerized into homopolymers, random copolymore or block copolymors utilising alkali metal initiator systems. Lithium has been proven to be a particularly good metal for this process. When the initiation is done with an organomonoalkali metal initiator, a living polymer is produced, the molecules of which consist essentially of a polymer chain having atached terminally thereto an alkali metal atom. As is also well known in the art, the polymere having attached thereto an alkali metal atom can be coupled. In one procedure, two or more of these molecules are chemically connected to a central unit originating from the coupling agent so that two or more polymer chains are attached to this one central unit. This process of coupling is used primarily for increasing the green tensile strenght of rubbery polymere and for making linear and radial block copolymore that may have the desirable properties of thermoplastid elastomere.Thermoplastic elastomere can be obtained by coupling more than two living monoalkali polymer chains such as to form a radial teleblock copolymer having polymer chains connected to one centrnl unit, the free ends of which consists of polymer blocks that are capable of forming physical crosslinks, whercas at leasta portion of the remainig polymer chains contributes to the rubbery properties of the so formed composition. These thermoplastic elastomers have the desirable property of having high tensile strength without being chemically crosslinked and cnn be melted and formed into various shapes like plastics. As a general rule, it is desirable to achieve a high degree of coupling as well as A high coupling efficiency. To improve these features of a process for making coupled polymers an described remains a continuing problem.

Generally the coupled polymers obtained by the process of this invention have a number average molecular weight of 5,000 to 3,000,000, more preferably 50,000 to 1,500,000. Coupling Agents The initial or first coupling agent utilized in accordance with this invention is n non terminating coupling agent. By the term non terminating coupling agents , such chemicalo are meant that do not renove the alkali netal to any substantial degree from the coupled polymer but rather form a living coupled polymer in which n plurnlity of polymer chains are attached to a central unit and approximately the same number of alkali metals are also attached to this central unit. Thorcforo, partictllarly halogen based coupling agents such as silicon tetrachioride are not within the scope of the initial or first non terminating RTI ID 8.5 cotlplinx. agent. The initial coupling step is accomplishod preferably using a nonterminating coupling agent capable of coupling the living polymer to a high degree of coupling of about 8 15. Polyvinyl aromatic compounds are the preforrod non terminating coupling agent. Polyvinyl aromatic compounds useful in accordance with this invention are exemplified by the following general formulae EMI8.1 wherein Y is a vinyl group, and wherein each R iR hydrogen or nn alkyl group containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms with a total of tho alkyl substituents having no more than 12 carbon atoms and wherein n in nn integer of 2 or 3. The vinyl substituents in the above formulas b and c can be on either or both rings. Exemplary of suitable polyvinyl aromatic compounds are 1,2 divinylbenzene 1,3 divinylbenzone 1,4 divinylbenzone 1,2,4 trivinylbenzene 1,3 divinylnaphtalene 1,8 divinylnaphtalene 1,3,5, trivinylnaphtalene 2,4 divinylbiphenyl 3,5,4 trivinylbiphenyl 1,2 divinyl 3,4 dimethylbenzene 1,5,6 trivinyl 3,7 diathylnaphtalene 1,3 divinyl 4,5,8 tributylnaphtalene and 2,2 divinyl 4 ethyl 4 propylbiphenyl. Divinyl aromatic hydrocarbons containing up to 26 carbon ntomo per molecule are preferrod for employment according to this Siwention, pnrtlcularly divinylbenzene in either ite ortho, meta or para isomer.Commercial divinylbenzene which is a mixture of said isomer. is also quite satisfactory, The amounts of non terminating coupling agent to be used broadly covers a polyvinyl aromatic compound alkali metal molar ratio of 0,25 1 to 10 1, more prefferably 1.5 1 to 5 1. The second coupling anent does not have to be a non terminating coupling agent. The second coupling agent which is ndded sequentially after the first coupling agent, io usually one that is capable of coupling a living polymer to a low degree of coupling of about 2. The preferred group of second coupling agents is composed of those which are capable of coupling only two living polymer chains, i.e. dicoupling agents. The degree of coupling both for the initial non terminating coupling agent and for the second coupling agent is determined and measured as will be described in detail later.Preferred examples of second coupling agents are carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, carbon disulfide, carbonyl sulfide, alpha , alpha dichloro p xylane, methyl methacrylate, bromine. chlorine, iodine, ethyl acetate, nethyl propionate, butyrolactone, bis bromoethyl ether, 1,4 dichloro 2 butone, dimethyldichlorosilane, and dibromosilane. The amount of secind coupling agent which can be used is generally in the ranee of molar ratios of difunctional coupling agent alkali metal of 0.2 l to 5 1, ore preferably O.211 to 1.25 1. The coupling agents can be added neat to the polymer cement polymer solution as formed , or as a solution in an inert hydrocarbon solvent. Examples of such solvents are the same as thosa of the diluents for the polymerisation process given above. the tcaperature ranges applicable for the coupling reactions is the santa as that for the polymerization reaction. The polymerization cements polymer solutions nn formed with the added coupling agents are agitated, e.g.by stirring or tumbling for the duration of the coupling reaction. The coupling reaction with divinylbenzene or other polyvinyl aromatic compound is allowed to proceed for 10 minutes to 2 hours, more generally from 30 to 60 minutes. The difunctional couplinp. agents are generally allowed to reset 1 to 60 minutes, more generally 5 to 30 minutes. Following the coupling reaction, the coupled polymers are recovered from the polymerization mixtures by typical procedures known in the art such as coagulation in an alcohol. The living polymers that are coupled in accordance with this invention can be described no having the general formula Q M wherein Q is a hydrocarbon polymer or copolyner of an alkadiene andlor a monovinyl subsstituted arene and wherein M stands for an alkali metal atom. The preferred croup of alkali metal atoms M is selected frem the group consisting of sodium, potassium and lithium, lithium being the most preferred.After the first non terminating coupling step a living coupled polymer is obtained that has the formula X M wherein X represents a central unit obtained or derived from the coupling agent and m and m are integers that are generally equal to each other. Yor the production of thermoplastic elastomers, those living polymers having the general formula E D M are particularly preferred. In this formula, E represents a block that is capable of forming, a physical crosslink. Such blocks can either be characterized as polymer blocks capable of forming crystalline regions eventually after their hydrogenation or as blocks forming domains having a glass transition temperature above their normal temperature of use. Preferred examples of those blocks E are low vinyl polybutadiene blocks and polymono vinylarcne blocks from monovinylarenes having 8 to 20 carbon atoms. The.low vinyl polybutadiene end brock after hydropenation forms poiyethylene lika crystalline centers whereas, for example, polystyrene blocks form glassy polystyrene areas hoth function ne a physical crosslink giving the final polymer a very high tensile strength without actual chemical crosslinkings. The block D is n homopolymer or a copolymer of nn alkadiene having 4 4 to 12 carbon atoms per molecule and contributing rubbery properties to the polymer. This section D can te a single block or can he composed of several blocks. Examples for this block D are medium vinyl polybutadiene, polyisopreme, and a random butadiene styrene copolymer block. In accordance with a further embodiment of this invention, the final coupled polymer is subjected to nn additional step of at least Partially hydrogenating the olefinic unsaturation thereof lcavinp the aromatic unsatura tion essentially unchanged. This hydrogenation ctep is carried out in the presence of hydrogen and in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst under hydrogenation conditions. Such hydrogenation catalysts and lxydrogenation conditions are generally wcll known in the art and a detailed description thereof can thereforo bo avoided.The hydrogenated coupled polymer is finally recovered as the product of the process. The latter can be done, for instance, by a standard procedure, such as coagulation and filtration. The hydrogenation of the olefinic unsaturations described is particularly well suited as a means for producing a thermoplastic elastomer starting from polymers having, the above defined formula R D M with F. being a e.g. low vinyl polybutadiene block. lir accordance with a still further embodiment of this invention, coupled polymers are provided which can be defined as being obtainable by a process as defined. The coupled copolymers of this invention therefore aro those obtained by coupling a living polymer in a first coupling step ae defined followed by a second coupling otop as defined in detail above. The polymers of the present invention can be used in various applications, depending upon their specific properties. Many of those polymers are rubbery and these polymers can therefore bo shaped into articles which desirably havo elastic properties. These article can be then crosslinked by methods well known in tile art. Other applications of the polymers of this invention are in the field of thermoplastic elastomere. These polymers as described can be formed into various shapes such as hoses or belts exhibiting bigh tensile strength without chemical curing. The invention will be more fully understood from the following examples, which are intended to illustrate yet more preferred embodiments of this invention but not to unduly limit the scope thereof.

The degree of coupling observed using divinylbenzene alone E and F is indicative of the formation of a radial coupled by each divinylbentene molecule. The degree of coupling of 2 achieved with the carbon monoxide illustrates its difunctional character in coupling two polymerlithiums to form n linear coupled product. Tho sequential coupling of polymerlithium with divinylbenzene and carbon monoxide results in significantly higher coupling efficiencies n andI , indicating that carbon monoxide effectively couples the imperfectly di vinylbenzene couplod polymer product. When the imperfectly coupled polymer product obtained using a 1 1 divinylbenzone lithium molar ratio was further coupled with carbon monoxide II two coupled products were formed.The distribution of polymer products and the degree of coupling calculated from the rel permeation chromatographic curve indicated that 40 of the living, polymer coupled to linear polymer, a degree of coupling of 2, end 60X coupled to a radial polymer with a degree of coupling of 9. A completely unexpected result occured when the divinylbenzene lithium molar ratio was increased to 2 1 and this product then further coupled with carbon monoxide. On the GPC curve no coupling of uncoupled polymerlithium to a linear chain degree of coupling of 2 could be detected, but instead theGPC curve shows that only radial polymer was formed having a degree of coupling of 11, i.e. the final polymer had an averapo of 11 of the original polymer lithium chains coupled to a highly branched radial polymer.
