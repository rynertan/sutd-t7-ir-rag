# Adjustable shelving system.

## Abstract
Posts 12 support shelves 30 by way of support clips 18 which engage annular recesses 14 in the posts. Shelf members 30 have upper transverse ribs 40 and lower longitudinal ribs for strenthening and support rails 48 at their edges for coupling to adjacent shelf members by means of railing 52 with grooves 54. In the example shown the railing 52 has openings 60 for the passage of the posts 12 and recesses on its underside to accommodate the clips 18. Alternatively shelf members 30 have these features and the railing 52 serves only for coupling the edges of adjacent shelf members.
