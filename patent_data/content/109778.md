# Puzzle game.

## Abstract
Apparatus for playing a game comprises a casing 12, 13 which serves also as the playing surface 12 through which project a plurality of push buttons 171 179 for actuating the keys in selected positions. The push buttons 171 179 are arranged in a plurality of rows and columns with elongate light sources 181 186, 191 196 extending parallel to the rows of columns and between adjacent pairs of row wise or column wise push buttons 171 179 . The electronic circuit within the casing acts to detect depression of two adjacent push buttons 171 179 in any row or column and operates when such detection is made to cause the light source 181 186, 191 196 between the two push buttons depressed to illuminate and remain illuminated until the end of the game so that by depressing pairs of push buttons in turn players can claim sides of the squares constituted by the light sources. An embodiment including a microproces sor 201 with a programme for providing moves represent ing those made by an opponent is also disclosed so that the apparatus can be used by one player.
