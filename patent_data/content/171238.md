## Description
This invention relates to light sensitive silver halide grains suitable for higher sensitization, to a preparation thereof and to light sensitive silver halide photographic materials. The present invention further concerns silver halide emulsions having epitaxial hybridized silver salt crystals comprising developable silver salt crystals, such as silver chloride or silver halochloride, epitaxially junctioned onto silver iodobromide or silver bromide host crystals, which have excellent sensitivity and developability. In recent years, silver halide emulsions for photography have had to satisfy increasingly severe requirements, namely high sensitivity, excellent graininess, high sharpness, low fog density and sufficiently high optical density. As a high sensitivity emulsion responding to such requirements, silver iodobromide emulsions containing 0 to 10 mol iodine are well known. Methods for preparing these emulsions are those in which the pH and pAg are controlled, such as the ammoniacal method, the neutral method, the acidic method, and mixing methods such as the single jet method or the double jet method. On the basis of these known techniques, in order to accomplish even higher sensitization, improvment of graininess, high sharpness and low fog, very precise technical means have been investigated and applied. For the silver iodobromide emulsion aimed at by the present invention, studies have been done on emulsions with controlled iodine concentration distributions within the individual silver halide grains, and crystal habits and grain size distribution. The most orthodox method for accomplishing high sensitivity, excellent graininess, high sharpness, low fog density and sufficiently high covering power is to improve the quantum efficiency of a silver halide. For this purpose, knowledge about solid physics have been applied. A study which calculates theoretically the quantum efficiency and speculates about the effect of grain size distribution is disclosed in, for example, the pretext of the Tokyo Symposium concerning Progress in Photography in 1980, entitled Interactions between Light and Materials for Photographic Applications , on page 91. According to this study, it is predicted that the quantum efficiency can be improved in a mono dispersed emulsion by narrowing the grain size distribution. In addition, for accomplishing sensitization of a silver halide emulsion, in the step of chemical sensitization as described hereinafter in detail, it is resonable to estimate that a mono dispersed emulsion would be advantageous for accomplishing efficiently high sensitivity while maintaining low fogging. For the industrial preparation of a mono dispersed emulsion it is necessary to control the feeding rate of silver ions and halogen ions to the reaction system, theoretically determined under sufficient stirring conditions, on the basis of pAg and pH, as disclosed in Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 48521 1979. Silver halide emulsions prepared under these conditions comprise the so called normal crystal grains having 100 faces and 111 faces, having either cubic, octahedral or tetradecahedral shapes in various proportions. Higher sensitization has been known to be possible with such crystal grains. On the other hand, a silver iodobromide emulsion comprising poly dispersed twin crystal grains is known in the art as a silver halide emulsion suitable for use in a high sensitivity photographic film. In Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 113927 1983 and others, a silver halide emulsion containing flat plate twin crystal grains is disclosed. Although these techniques contribute to higher sensitization, demands for higher sensitization always exist. On the other hand, for broadening the exposure region, it is known to employ two or more emulsions with different sensitivities, for example by mixing two or more emulsions with different average grain sizes. By combination of the above higher sensitization technique and the technique for broadening the exposure region, it is possible to obtain a light sensitive photographic material having a high sensitivity to some extent and a broad exposure region. However, development of techniques for realizing further improvements still exist. On the other hand, a silver halide emulsion containing epitaxial hybridized silver halide crystals comprising polygonal crystals of silver iodide and silver chloride crystals formed through epitaxial junction onto the polygonal crystals is known to have both the radiation sensitivity of silver iodide and rapid developability of silver chloride, and also release a relatively large quantity of iodide ions when developed, thereby giving a the preferred photographic effect obtainable by iodide ions, as disclosed in Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 10372 1978. To improve the processability of this emulsion, European Patent Application No. 0019917 published on December 10, 1980 discloses a silver halide emulsion containing crystals of a silver halide with less than 10 mole of silver iodide formed through epitaxial junction onto silver halide crystals containing 15 to 40 mol of silver iodide. The use of highly concentrated iodide is avoided in the host grains in the above emulsion in Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 133540 1984. In this technique, silver iodobromide with a low silver iodide content is employed as the host grains. By use of these techniques, light sensitive photographic materials capable of giving images excellent in sharpness through the edge effect can be obtained, but they still have low sensitivity for practical application. Therefore a technique to enhance sensitivity is required. EP A 0145440, which has a earlier priority date than those of the present application but which was published after the priority dates of the present application, discloses a process for preparing silver iodobromide grains in the presence of a tetrazaindene compound. However, no indication is given that grains having 110 or semi 110 crystal faces are formed. FR A 2137880 discloses silver halide grains having 110 crystal planes, wherein the silver halide is silver chloride and or silver chlorobromide. The present invention seeks to provide firstly silver halide grains and a light sensitive silver halide photographic material having an excellent sensitivity fog relationship, and secondly a process for the preparation of such grains. The present invention also seeks to provide a light sensitive silver halide photographic material having excellent graininess, sharpness and sensitivity fog relationship and also a broad exposure region, and light sensitive silver halide grains suitable for use in such a material. The present invention additionally seeks to provide a silver halide photographic emulsion and a light sensitive silver halide photographic material containing epitaxial hybridized silver salt crystals having excellent developing effect the effect of improving sharpness through the edge effect and developability, and also having improved sensitivity. The first object of the present invention can be accomplished by silver halide grains, having 110 and or semi 110 crystal faces and comprising a silver halide composition consisting substantially of silver bromide or silver iodobromide, 0 to less than 10 mole of other silver halides and 0 to 1 mole silver chloride, a light sensitive silver halide photographic emulsion comprising said grains and a light sensitive silver halide photographic material comprising said emulsion provided on a support. The object of the present invention can also be accomplished by a process for producing silver halide grains consisting substantially of silver iodobromide or silver bromide, 0 to less than 10 mole of other silver halides and 0 to 1 mole silver chloride, which comprises controlling the pAg at from 8.0 to 9.5 during the period until at least 30 mole of the total silver halide is formed in the step of preparing the silver halide grains, in the presence of at least one compound of formula I , II , III or IV or compound having recurring units of formula V shown below wherein R₁, R₂ and R₃, which may be the same or different, each represent a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a hydroxyl group, an amino group, a derivative of an amino group, an alkyl group, a derivative of an alkyl group, an aryl group, a derivative of an aryl group, a cycloalkyl group, a derivative of a cycloalkyl group, a mercapto group, a derivative of a mercapto group or CONH R₄ wherein R₄ is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an amino group, a derivative of an alkyl group, a derivative of an amino group, a halogen atom, a cycloalkyl group, a derivative of a cycloalkyl group, an aryl group or a derivative of an aryl group , or wherein R₁ and R₂ may be bonded together to form a ring for example, a 5 to 7 membered carbon ring or a heterocyclic ring , R₅ represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group, X represents a monovalent group formed by eliminating one hydrogen atom from a compound of formula I , II , III or IV for example, those formed by eliminating one hydrogen atom from R₁ to R₃ or from a OH group , and J represents a divalent linking group. The silver halide grains may have crystals faces having ridgelines on the center of the 110 faces. The other objects of the present invention can be accomplished by hybridized silver salt crystal grains, or a silver halide photographic emulsion comprising said grains, said grains comprising developable silver salt crystals formed by epitaxial junction on host silver halide grains consisting substantially of silver iodobromide or silver bromide, 0 to less than 10 mole of other silver halides and 0 to 1 mole silver chloride, and having 110 and or semi 110 cystal faces faces having ridgelines on the 110 faces , and a light sensitive silver halide photographic material comprising at least one said emulsion layer on a support. The objects of the present invention can further be accomplished by silver halide grains, and a light sensitive silver halide photographic material comprising said grains, said grains having 110 faces and or semi 110 faces and a core shell structure, and comprising a silver halide composition consisting substantially of silver iodobromide or silver bromide, 0 to less than 10 mole of other silver halides and 0 to 1 mole silver chloride. Figs. 1 to 9 show the crystal forms of silver halide grains of the present invention having 110 faces. Figs. 10 to 17 show those of silver halide grains of the present invention having semi 110 faces. Figs. 19 to 24 are electron microscopic photographs of silver halide grains of the present invention Figs. 18 and 25 are those of silver halide grains for comparative purpose Figs. 26 to 29 are those of the silver halide grains of the present invention Figs. 30 and 31 are electron microscopic photographs the hybridized silver halide crystals of the present invention and Fig. 32 is the characteristic curve of Example 17. The silver halide grains according to the present invention are crystals having Miller indices 110 face and or face having a ridgeline at the center of the 110 face hereinafter called a semi 110 face on their outer surfaces. They may be either normal crystals or twin crystals including multiple twins . Said grains include those defined in the following paragraphs 1 to 4 The crystal face having a ridgeline at the center of the 110 face this crystal face is referred to as the semi 110 face which may be possessed by the silver halide grains of the present invention is now described by referring to the drawings. Fig. 10 shows a silver halide grain having a semi 110 face. In Fig. 10, 2 is the semi 110 face. Fig. 11 is a partial plan view of the portion including the 110 face as viewed from the direction perpendicular to the 110 face 1 shown by a broken line Figs. 12 and 13 are the front view and side view thereof respectively. In these Figures, 3 is the central ridgeline of the 110 face of 1 and 2 the semi 110 face. In the silver halide grains according to the present invention, the form of the semi 110 face is not limited to those as shown in Figs. 10 to 13 the angle between the two semi 110 faces of the roof like ridgeline may be more obtuse than 110 . Examples of these are shown in Figs.14 to 17. The photographic emulsion of the present invention, which employes the grains of the present invention as described above, as host grains for hybridized silver salt crystals, has a higher sensitivity than a photographic emulsion containing hybridized silver salt crystals using host grains of the prior art. While the mechanism is not yet clear, increased sensitivity results probably because of the following reason. Due to the special property of the surfaces of the 110 face and semi 110 face, epitaxial junctions will selectively occur at particular sites. Thus the epitaxial portions which are the sites for latent image formation are restricted. This reduces the loss by latent image dispersion. A dodecahedron has 14 corners, of which 8 corners consist of boundaries of three 110 faces corner From the electron microscopic photograph it can be seen that epitaxial growth has occurred selectively at the corner portions of the dodecahedron crystal, and more selectively on corner The corner It has been impossible to restrict the reactive site to the specific site through utilization of the difference in reactivities between the minutely existing 100 face and 111 face in the crystals of the prior art consisting only of two faces, a 100 face and a 111 face. In the crystals of the prior art, if the surface area of one of the faces is enlarged, the other face will be made smaller, with consequential changes in crystal habit and shape. In the crystals of the present invention, due to the presence of three types of faces, the surface areas of the 100 and 111 faces can be varied independently of each other, whereby selection of the reactivity which could not be obtained in the crystals of the prior art is mode possible. The epitaxy as mentioned in the present specification has the same meaning as the term disclosed in Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 103725 1978 hereinafter called Literature 1 and U.S. Patent No. 4,142,900 hereinafter called Literature 2 . That is, it means that the crystallographic orientations of silver salt atoms such as silver chloride, silver chlorobromide, silver iodobromide and silver chloroiodobromide junctioned onto the host grains of silver iodobromide or silver bromide are controlled by the crystals of silver iodobromide or silver bromide as the host grains during growth of these. The epitaxial relationship between the developable epitaxial silver salts such as silver chloride, silver chlorobromide, silver iodobromide and silver chloroiodobromide and the portion of the silver halide as the host grains of silver iodobromide or silver bromide in the hybridized silver salt crystal is entirely different from the direct physical contact between the crystals such as silver iodide, silver chloride, silver iodobromide and silver chlorobromide. The host grains in the hybridized silver salt crystals of the present invention are silver halide grains having a silver halide composition consisting substantially of silver iodobromide or silver bromide as defined above such a silver halide composition may hereinafter be referred to merely as silver iodobromide . As silver iodobromide grains, there are known in the prior art poly dispersed grains comprising the so called normal crystal grains consisting of 100 faces and 111 faces, namely grains having cubic, octahedral or tetradecahedral shapes or twin crystals. The normal crystal grains are grains which are primarily mono dispersed. The host silver iodobromide crystals known in the prior art are normal crystals having octahedral, tetradecahedral or cubic shapes consisting of 100 and or 111 faces or twin crystal grains. The host silver iodobromide crystals used in the present invention have 110 and or semi 110 faces. This is a novel product having an entirely different surface from the normal crystal or twin crystal described above. The present inventors have discovered that a highly sensitive emulsion can be obtained when the crystals having the novel surface are used as the host crystals for the epitaxial emulsion. The silver halide grains and the host grains for the hybridized silver salt crystals are silver halide grains having a silver halide composition consisting substantially of silver iodobromide or silver bromide as defined above. Here, consisting substantially of silver iodobromide or silver bromide means that other silver halides than silver bromide and silver iodide, for example, silver chloride, may be contained within the range which does not interfere with the effect of the present invention. More specifically, in the case of silver chloride, its proportion is 1 mole or less. The proportion of silver iodide in the silver halide grains according to the present invention should preferably be 0 to 20 mole , more preferably 1 to 15 mole . The proportion of silver iodide in the host silver halide grains according to the present invention should preferably be 0 to 40 mole , and the content of silver iodide should be set at an optimum value depending on the purpose. More specifically, when it is desired to obtain an optical density by developing most of the host silver halide crystals, it is preferred to use AgI in an amount within the range which does not interfere with developability. Depending on the light sensitive material to be employed, the optimum AgI content is preferably 2 to 10 mole in the case of color negative light sensitive materials, and 0 to 4 mole in the case of X ray sensitive materials. On the other hand, when it is desired to utilize positively the development inhibiting effect of I The upper limit of the AgI concentration is not limited from the use viewpoint, but the content at which it can exist stably thermodynamically as a solid solution is limited. This is 40 mole at ordinary emulsion preparation temperatures 20 C 90 C . The silver halide grains according to the present invention preferably comprise cores having a silver halide composition comprising 3 to 40 mole of silver iodide and shells covering said cores having a silver halide composition comprising 0 to 10 mole of silver iodide, with the difference in silver iodide content between the shells and cores being 2 to 30 mole . The silver iodide content at the boundary between the core and the shell may be changed as desired, for example, continuously or stepwise. The proportion of silver iodide in the silver halide grains is, for example, 1 to 20 mole . The core may contain a portion with silver iodide content of 0 e.g. the portion corresponding to the seed grain in the preparation thereof . The shell should desirably have a thickness which does not shield the preferred inherent properties of the core, and yet to the contrary which does shield the unpreferred inherent properties of the core. Specifically, the shell should preferably have a thickness of from 0.01 to 0.3 µm. The proportion of the surface areas of the 110 faces and or semi 110 faces relative to the total surface area of the host grains is preferably 30 or more. In the silver halide grains according to the present invention, the silver halide composition consisting substantially of silver iodobromide means that silver halides other than silver iodobromide e.g. silver chloride may also be contained, provided that the effect of the present invention is not impaired. Specifically, the content of silver halides other than silver iodobromide is less than 10 mole . The grain size of the silver halide grains according to the present invention is not particularly limited, but the present invention is most effective if the size is within the preferred range of 0.1 to 3.0 µm. In the present specification, the grain size of the silver halide refers to the length of one side of a cubic body which is equal to its volume. The silver halide grains according to the present invention are generally prepared and used when dispersed in a dispersing medium such as gelatin, namely is the form of an emulsion. The grains may be either mono dispersed or poly dispersed, and may be a mixture thereof. It can be selected suitably depending on the uses. In the case of hybridized silver salt crystals comprising developable silver salt crystals formed through epitaxial junction onto host grains, a mono dispersed emulsion is preferred, since epitaxial growth should desirably occur uniformly in crystals. The mono dispersed emulsion is one in which the fluctuation coefficient of grain size distribution percentage of the standard deviation of grain sizes relative to the average grain size is 20 or less, preferably 15 or less, more preferably 10 or less. For the preparation of the silver halide grains according to the present invention, in the step of forming silver halide grains by mixing a solution of a water soluble silver salt and a solution of a water soluble halide in the presence of a protective colloid, the pAg of the emulsion is controlled to from 8.0 to 9.5 within a certain period of time. During this period at least one compound of formula I , II , III or IV or a compound having recurring units of formula V is incorporated in the emulsion. Among the compounds of formulae I , II , III and IV , the compound of formula I is preferred. In the process for the preparation of the silver halide grains according to the present invention, seed grains may be employed which may be grown by forming silver halide on their surfaces. When seed grains are employed, their silver halide composition may be within the scope of that which is capable of forming the silver halide grains according to the present invention. The above period of time for controlling the pAg may be at any desired point within the term when silver halide can be formed, namely at the initial stage, in the course of or at the end of the silver halide formation step. This period should preferably be continuous, but it can also be intermittent within the range which does not interfere with the effect of the present invention. The pAg within this period should preferably be from 8.0 to 9.5, more preferably from 8.4 to 9.2. During this period, the pH of the emulsion should preferably be maintained at from 7 to 10. The pAg of the silver halide outside this period of time should appropriately be from 4 to 11.5, preferably from 6 to 11, and the pH appropriately be from 2 to 12, preferably from 5 to 11. In the process for preparation of the silver halide grains of the present invention, the step of forming silver halide grains should preferably be carried out by adding an aqueous ammoniacal silver nitrate solution and an aqueous halide solution in the presence of ammonia according to the double jet method. It is also preferred to add the silver and halide solutions so that no new crystal nuclei are formed during grain growth.

J is a divalent linking group, preferably having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms. Of such linking groups, those represented by formula J I or J II shown below are preferred In the above formulae, Y represents O or The divalent linking group particularly preferred as J may include the following CONHCH₂ , CONHCH₂CH₂ , CONHCH₂OCOCH₂ , CONHCH₂CH₂CH₂ OCOCH₂ , COOCH₂ , COOCH₂CH₂ , COOCH₂CH₂OCOCH₂ , COOCH₂CH₂CH₂OCOCH₂ and The compound having the units of formula V may be either a homopolymer or a copolymer. The copolymer may be, for example, a copolymer of a monomer such as acrylamide, methacrylamide, an acrylate and a methacrylate. Examples of the compounds of formula I , II , III or IV or of the compounds having recurring units of formula V hereinafter referred to as tetraazaindene compounds to be used in the present invention are The tetraazaindene compound used in preparation of the silver halide grains of the present invention may be added in an amount which depends on the preparation conditions such as the desired silver halide grain size, temperature of the emulsion, pH, pAg and the content of silver iodide. It is preferably used within the range of from 10 ⁵ to 2 x 10 ¹ mole per mole of the total silver halide to be formed. When the tetraazaindene compound is a compound having recurring units of formula V , the moles of the tetraazaindene moiety is reckoned as the amount added. Further preferred amounts relative to the grain sizes are listed in Table 1. The amounts to be added relative to the grain sizes other than those listed in Table 1 can be determined according to the extrapolation method or the interpolation method from the grain sizes, which are inversely proportional to the amounts added. Further preferred amounts added relative to the pAg and the silver iodide content are listed in Table 2. The tetraazaindene compound may be previously added in a protective colloid solution, or added gradually with the growth of the silver halide grains, or is a combination of these. In the process for producing silver halide grains of the present invention, seed grains may be used and grains may be grown by forming silver halide on the surfaces thereof. When employing seed grains, their silver halide compositions may be that which can form the silver halide grains according to the present invention. In the silver halide grains of the present invention, a core shell type is preferred. The core shell type silver halide grains can be prepared by forming shells over silver halide grains prepared as cores. Shells can be formed by depositing a soluble halide solution and a soluble silver salt solution on the cores by the double jet method. Methods for preparation of the above core shell type silver halide grains are disclosed in, for example, West German Patent No. 11 69 290, British Patent No. 1,027,146, Japanese Provisional Patent Publication No. 154232 1982 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 1417 1976. The silver halide grains of the present invention can be subjected to reductive sensitization at any point during their preparation. Reductive sensitization may be performed by stirring the emulsion under low pAg conditions, namely by silver ripening, or by the use of a suitable reducing agent such as stannous chloride, dimethylamine borane, hydrazine or thiourea dioxide. The silver halide grains of the present invention may be doped with various metal salts or metal complexes on formation of silver halide by precipitation, during growth of grains or after completion of growth. Examples of metal salts or complexes are those of gold, platinum, palladium, iridium, rhodium, bismuth, cadmium and copper. The excessive halides or by produced or unnecessary salts such as nitrates or ammonium salts and other compounds may be removed from the dispersing medium for said grains. The method for removal may be the Noodel water washing method, the dialysis method or the coagulation precipitation method conventionally used for emulsions in general. The silver halide grains of the present invention can also be subjected to various chemical sensitizing methods used on emulsions in general. Chemical sensitization can be effected with the use of a chemical sensitizer or a combination of chemical sensitizers selected from active gelatin noble metal sensitizers such as water soluble gold salts, water soluble platinum salts, water soluble palladium salts, water soluble rhodium salts and water soluble iridium salts sulfur sensitizers selenium sensitizers and reductive sensitizers as mentioned above. The silver halide grains can furthermore be sensitized optically to a desired wavelength region. The method for optical sensitization of the emulsion of the present invention is not particularly limited. The emulsion can be sensitized optically by using optical sensitizers either individually or in combination, for example, cyanine dyes such as zeromethyne dyes, monomethyne dyes, dimethyne dyes or trimethyne dyes or melocyanine dyes e.g. ultra color sensitization . These techniques are also disclosed in U.S. Patents No. 2,688,545, No. 2,912,329, No. 3,397,060, No. 3,615,635 and No. 3,628,964 British Patents No. 1,195,302, No. 1,242,588 and No. 1,293,862, West German OLS No. 20 30 326 and No. 21 21 780 and Japanese Patent Publications No. 4936 1968 and No. 14030 1969. These sensitizers can be chosen as desired depending on the purpose and uses of the light sensitive material, such as the wavelength to be sensitized and sensitivity. The silver halide grains of the present invention can be used either as such or as a blend of two or more types of grains with different average grain sizes, which may be formulated to a desired tone at any time after formation of the grains. They can also be used as a mixture with silver halide grains other than those of the present invention. The hybridized silver salt crystals of the present invention are formed by epitaxial junction of a developable silver salt on the polyhedron crystal of silver iodobromide or silver bromide. Here, developable means that the silver salt can be developed with a known developer for silver halide. The silver salt is insoluble or substantially insoluble in water. Preferred examples of silver salts for epitaxial junction include silver halide crystals such as silver iodobromide, silver bromide, silver chlorobromide and silver chloride, and developable silver salts other than silver halides, for example silver thiocyanate, silver cyanate, silver carbonate, silver ferricyanate, silver arsenate, silver arsenite and silver chromate. When the silver salt to be epitaxially junctioned is a silver iodobromide, it is preferred to use a silver halide with lower silver iodide content than the host crystals. When the host crystals are silver bromide, the silver halide to be epitaxially junctioned is preferably silver chlorobromide or silver chloride. Formation of the crystals of silver halide having epitaxially junctioned crystalline structures may be performed according to the following methods. In the case of epitaxial crystals having a composition outside the range specified above, they can be prepared similarly as described above. In the present invention, at least a half of the polyhedral crystal faces of silver iodobromide or silver bromide of the host crystals are substantially free from epitaxial silver halide. It is preferred that said epitaxial silver halide is restricted to 75 mole or less of the hybridized silver halide as a whole. The epitaxial crystals in the hybridized silver salt crystals in the present invention can be subjected to reductive sensitization and doping with a metal salt or complex similarly as the above host grains. It is also possible to remove excessive halides and other unnecessary compounds after formation of epitaxial crystals, similarly as in the case of the above host crystals. The hybridized silver salt crystals of the present invention can be subjected to the various chemical sensitization methods generally applied for emulsions in general. They can be subjected to chemical sensitization by using chemical sensitizers either individually or in combination, including active gelatin noble metal sensitizers such as water soluble gold salts, water soluble platinum salts, water soluble palladium salts, water soluble rhodium salts, water soluble iridium salts sulfur sensitizers selenium sensitizers and the reductive sensitizers described above. The photographic emulsion according to the present invention exhibits a preferred interimage effect and edge effect. For example, it is possible to use in the present invention iodide ions released in the developing step for inactivation of the surface of an unhomogeneous catalyst as employed in the redox amplification reaction between, for example, an oxidizing agent e.g. cobalt hexamine or hydrogen peroxide and a dye image forming reducing agent color forming developing agent or redox dye releasing agent, which is used together with for example, an electron transfer agent . The photographic emulsion of the present invention can be applied on a suitable support and dried, subjected to imagewise exposure by visible light and developed under appropriate developing conditions to give a photographic silver image. Even under redox amplification reaction conditions, the iodide ions released during development can be used as the redox amplification catalyst for inactivation of the silver image. The photographic emulsion according to the present invention, by containing a dye forming coupler, can give both a silver image and dye image, and yet these images have the advantages of small graininess and grain size. The photographic emulsion of the present invention is capable of selective developing, such as developing of the epitaxial silver salt and developing of both the epitaxial silver salt and the host grains. Accordingly, the photographic emulsion according to the present invention has the advantage that the graininess and grain size of the photographic image or the release of iodide ions can be controlled or that the developing conditions for controlling the maximum density of the image obtained can be selected. An example according to the present invention is now described in more detail. The photographic emulsion according to the present invention may, for example, contain hybridized crystals of silver iodobromide containing 0 to 40 mole of silver iodide with the silver salt as mentioned above. The host grain for each hybridized crystal is a crystal of silver iodobromide, which has the same photosensitivity as the silver iodide crystals detailed in Literatures 1 and 2. The silver iodobromide used in the present invention should preferably have a minimum grain size of at least 0.2 µm. On the other hand, the second moiety of each hybridized crystal, namely the moiety formed through epitaxial junction on the polyhedron crystal of the silver iodobromide host grain, should preferably be a crystal of silver halide containing 10 mole or less of silver iodide such as silver chloride, silver chlorobromide, silver iodobromide or silver choroiodobromide. The epitaxial hybridized crystal used in the present invention acts through the silver iodobromide crystal moiety as the first radiation receptor. Imagewise exposure of a photographic emulsion containing the hybridized crystals of the present invention to blue light results in the formation of a developable latent image. Exposure of the hybridized crystal can make the whole hybridized crystal developable, but only the epitaxial silver salt crystal moiety can be developed. The hybridized crystals used in the present invention should have no epitaxial silver salt crystals on at least a half of the polyhedral crystal faces of the silver iodobromide, and the epitaxial silver salt crystal is restricted to 75 mole or less of the whole hybridized silver halide. The epitaxial silver salt crystal, when it reaches 75 mole , will encroach on the sites of the silver iodobromide crystal faces at which epitaxial growth begins and the adjacent epitaxial crystal structures on the surfaces of the silver iodobromide crystal faces. The epitaxial silver salt crystal in the hybridized crystal of the present invention is not the first radiation receptor of said hybridized crystal. For this reason, the photographic speed of the photographic emulsion according to the present invention is not controlled solely by radiation irradiated upon the epitaxial silver salt crystals. The amount of the epitaxial silver salt crystal in the hybridized crystal should desirably be 1 to 50 mole of the whole hybridized silver salt crystal, more preferably 5 mole at its minimum. The epitaxial silver salt promotes the initial developing speed. The optimum amount of the epitaxial silver salt and its composition can be determined depending on, for example, the use of the photographic emulsion according to the present invention. For example, when characteristics of high radiation exposure level and rapid developing speed are required, higher levels of the epitaxial salt are employed than in the case of lower exposure radiation level and slower developing speed. On the other hand, for example, when the storage stability of the silver halide photographic emulsion having hybridized crystals is important, an epitaxial silver halide containing silver bromide or silver iodide is used. When it is used in one bath developing bleach fixing processing, it is advantageous to control the balance between developing speed, bleaching speed and fixing speed by appropriate selection of the epitaxial silver salt composition. The six of the epitaxial silver salt crystals can also be controlled so as to make them developable without development of the silver iodobromide host grains. In this case, the graininess and the grain size of the photographic image will be determined by the limited size diameter of the epitaxial silver salt crystals provided that there is no dissolving physical development . The photographic speed is determined by the silver iodobromide host grains. The hybridized epitaxial silver salt crystals of the present invention are reactive for surface developing, so long as no particular change is effected during their formation. In other words, the photographic emulsion according to the present invention can be developed with a surface developer after imagewise exposure. The surface developer can initiate developing of a latent image existing on the surface of the silver halide crystal, and contains substantially no soluble iodide or silver halide solvent. The hybridized crystals of the present invention can be formed structurally so that the latent image formed by exposure can exist internally of the crystalline structure rather an on its surface. That is, the epitaxial silver salt crystals in the hybridized crystals of the present invention can be formed as a crystals capable of forming primarily inner latent images. For making inner images readily formable in the hybridized crystals, an inner dopant may be introduced into the epitaxial silver salt crystals. Such inner dopants include, for example, silver, sulfur, iridium, gold, platinum, osmium, rhodium, tellurium and selenium. The photographic emulsion according to the present invention containing such hybridized crystals may be developed with an inner developer containing a silver halide solvent or a soluble iodide. In the preparation of hybridized crystals for forming primarily inner latent images, the epitaxial silver salt crystals are prepared in the presence of non silver metal ions, preferably polyvalent metal ions. The epitaxial silver salt crystals are preferably formed in the presence of individual water soluble metal salts, more preferably in an acidic medium. The polyvalent metal ions preferably employed include divalent metal ions e.g. lead ions , trivalent metal ions e.g. antimony, bismuth, arsenic, gold, iridium and rhodium ions or tetravalent metal ions e.g. iridium ions . Preferred polyvalent metal ions are iridium, bismuth or lead ions. The epitaxial silver salt crystals generally contain 10 ⁹ mole , preferably 10 ⁶ mole , of an inner dopant based on the epitaxial silver salt, and the dopant exists in the epitaxial silver salt crystals at a concentration less than about 10 ¹ mole, preferably less than 10 ⁴ mole, per mole of the epitaxial silver salt. The hybridized crystals of the present invention comprise epitaxial silver salt crystals formed on the polyhedral crystal faces of silver iodobromide host grains, prefeably by methods A , B , C or D described above. Preparation of the silver iodobromide crystal host grains has already been described above, and typical examples of preparation are also given in the Examples below. The silver halide photographic emulsion according to the present invention can be modified by blending it with a different emulsion to obtain the desired photographic characteristics. According to this method, it is possible to control the photographic sensitivity and contrast. In the photographic emulsion according to the present invention, in the case of the hybridized crystals co existing with other blended silver halide crystals, the hybridized crystals will participate primarily in image formation, provided that the hybridized crystals of the present invention make up at least 50 by weight of the total silver halide crystals. However, even by blending at a level of 50 by weight or less, the interimage effect and the edge effect can effectively be controlled. In the present invention, silver chloride crystals can be blended with the hybridized crystals of the present invention. The blend with silver chloride crystals has the advantage that the developing speed and or the silver image density can be substantially intensified by physical development of the silver chloride crystals, although these crystals are not directly or chemically developable under the conditions set for exposure or developing processing. The blending ratio of the silver chloride crystals to the hybridized silver halide crystals can be chosen as desired depending on the use. In order to obtain a marked effect by dissolving physical development, the silver chloride crystals should desirably be blended with the hybridized crystals of the present invention in an amount of 1 to 50 by weight, more preferably 5 to 50 by weight, of the total silver halide. As the binder for the silver halide emulsion according to the present invention or the dispersing medium to be used for preparation of said grains, hydrophilic colloids conventionally used for silver halide emulsions may be employed. The hydrophilic colloid includes not only gelatin treated with either lime or acid , but also gelatin derivatives, for example, gelatin derivatives prepared by the reaction between gelatin and, for example, aromatic sulfonyl chloride, acid chloride, acid anhydride, isocyanate or 1,4 diketones as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,614,928 gelatin derivatives prepared by the reaction between gelatin and trimellitic acid anhydrides as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,118,766 gelatin derivatives prepared by the reaction between organic acids having active halogens and gelatin gelatin derivatives prepared by the reaction between aromatic glycidyl ether and gelatin as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 26845 1967 gelatin derivatives prepared by the reaction between, for example, maleimide, maleamic acid or unsaturated aliphatic diamide and gelatin as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,186,846 sulfoalkylated gelatin as disclosed in British Patent No. 1,033,189 polyoxyalkylene derivatives of gelatin as disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,312,553 polymer grafted products of gelatin, for example, those prepared from vinyl monomers such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, esters thereof with monohydric or polyhydric alcohols, amides thereof, acrylo or methacrylo nitrile, styrene and other vinylic monomers either individually or in combination grafted onto gelatin synthetic hydrophilic polymeric materials, for example, homopolymers or inter copolymers of monomers such as vinyl alcohol, N vinyl pyrrolidone, hydroxyalkyl meth acrylate, meth acrylamide or N substituted meth acrylamide, or copolymers of these monomers with, for example, meth acrylate, vinyl acetate, or styrene, copolymers of any of the above monomers with, for example, maleic anhydride or maleamic acid and natural hydrophilic macromolecular substances other than gelatin such as casein, agar, alginic acid or polysaccharides. These materials can be used either singly or as a mixture. The emulsion containing the silver halide grains according to the present invention can contain various additives conventionally used depending on the use. These additives may include, for example, stabilizers or antifoggants such as azaindenes, triazoles, tetrazoles, imidazolium salts, tetrazolium salts or polyhydroxy compounds film hardeners such as aldehyde type, aziridine type, isoxazole type, vinyl sulfone type, acryloyl type, carbodiimide type, maleimide type, methanesulfonate type a triazine type compounds developing acclerators such as benzyl alcohol or polyoxyethylene type compounds image stabilizers such as couromane type, couramane type, bisphenol type or phosphite ester type compounds and lubricants such as wax or glycerides of higher fatty acids. As the surfactants for coating aids, penetrability enhancers of processing solutions, defoaming agents or materials for controlling various physical properties, various kinds of anionic, cationic, nonionic and amphoteric surfactants can be used. As the antistatic agents, there may effectively be used, for example, diacetyl cellulose, styrene perfluoroalkylsodium maleate copolymer or alkali salts of the reaction product of a styrene maleic anhydride copolymer and p aminobenzenesulfonic acid. The matting agent may include polymethyl methacrylate, polystyrene and alkali soluble polymers. Furthermore, colloidal silicon oxide may also be used. As the latex to be added for improvement of film properties, there may be employed, for example, copolymers of an acrylate a vinyl ester with monomers having ethylenic groups. The gelatin plasticizer may be, for example, glycerine or a glycolic compound, and the thickener may include styrene sodium maleate copolymers or alkyl vinyl ether maleic acid copolymers. The silver halide grains according to the present invention may be used effectively in light sensitive photographic materials for various uses, such as general black and white, X ray, color, infrared, micro photography, silver dye bleaching, reversal and diffusion transfer. The hybridized silver salt crystals according to the present invention may also effectively be used in light sensitive photographic materials for various uses such as high contrast photography, photothermography or heat developing sensitive materials. The emulsion comprising the silver halide grains of the present invention can have abundant exposure latitude by mixing or coating in multiple layers at least two kinds of emulsion having different average grain sizes and different sensitivities. The light sensitive silver halide photographic material according to the present invention has at least one light sensitive silver halide emulsion layer comprising the silver halide grains according to the present invention on a support. The silver halide grains according to the present invention can be used in a color light sensitive material by employment of the method and the materials conventionally used for color light sensitive materials, for example by incorporating a combination of cyan, magenta and yellow couplers in the emulsions containing the silver halide grains according to the present invention, controlled to be red sensitive, green sensitive and blue sensitive. As the yellow coupler, closed ketomethylene type couplers may be employed. Among them, benzoylacetoanilide type and pivaloylacetanilide type compounds are useful. As the magenta coupler, pyrazolone type compounds, indazolone type compounds and cyanoacetyl compounds are useful, while phenol type compounds and naphthol compounds may be used as the cyan coupler. In the light sensitive silver halide photographic material, each of the red sensitive, green sensitive and blue sensitive layers may consist of two or more layers. For example, in a light sensitive color negative photographic material, two or three layers are preferably employed. The coating positions of the emulsions depend on the use of the material. When a plurality of layers of the same color sensitivity are employed, they can be separated from each other. The emulsion layer containing the silver halide grains according to the present invention may be any desired light sensitive layer. When each light sensitive layer consists of two or more layers with different sensitivities, the effect of the present invention can be greater when applied to the layer with higher sensitivity than when applied to the layer with lower sensitivity. The support for the light sensitive photographic material, is a suitable one depending on the use of the light sensitive material. Examples of the support are baryta paper, polyethylene coated paper, polypropylene synthetic paper, glass, cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate, polyvinyl acetal, polypropylene, polyester film e.g. polyethyleneterephthalate and polystyrene. These supports may be subbed if desired. The light sensitive photographic material having the silver halide grains according to the present invention can be developed according to known methods conventionally used after exposure. A suitable monochromatic developer is an alkali solution containing a developing agent such as a hydroxybenzene, aminophenol or aminobenzene, which may otherwise contain sulfites, carbonates, bisulfites, bromides and iodides. When the light sensitive photographic material is for color, color developing can be carried out according to the color developing method conventionally employed. According to the reversal method, developing is performed first with a monochromatic negative developer, then the material is subjected to white exposure or treatment with a bath containing a foggant and further subjected to color developing with an alkali developer containing a color developing agent. The processing method is not particularly limited all processing methods may be applicable. Typically, after color developing, bleach fixing processing is conducted and further, if desired, water washing and stabilizing processing may be performed. Alternatively, after color development, bleaching and fixing are separately conducted, followed further by water washing and stabilizing processing, if desired. For the developing processing of the light sensitive photographic material having the silver halide emulsion layer comprising the hybridized silver salt crystals according to the present invention, the methods shown in Literatures 1 and 2 may be applicable. Thus, the light sensitive material of the present invention can be physically developed according to the prior art technique and used in conventional transfer systems e.g. a colloid transfer system, silver salt diffusion transfer system, inhibition transfer system or color transfer system . For developing only the epitaxial crystals or both the epitaxial crystals and the silver iodobromide crystal host grains in the hybridized crystals in the photographic emulsion according to the present invention, it will suffice only to choose a suitable developing agent and further control merely the developing conditions. When a potent developing agent such as hydroquinone, catechol or phenidone is used, complete development of the hybridized silver salt crystals can be obtained. Similarly, when a color developing agent such as an aminophenol or p phenylenediamine is used together with a dye forming coupler, substantially complete development of the hybridized silver salt crystals can be obtained. On the other hand, when the color developing agent is used in the absence of a color forming coupler, only the epitaxial crystals are selectively developed. This is because developing is initiated at, for example, silver chloride, silver chlorobromide, silver iodobromide, silver chloroiodobromide or silver thiocyanate. At a relatively slow developing speed and without stirring, developing will cease after development of the epitaxial crystals has substantially been completed and before initiation of developing of the host silver iodobromide. The amount of the iodide ions released during developing can also be controlled. The photographic emulsion according to the present invention can suitably be used in the redox amplification system in which an unhomogeneous catalyst enabling the reaction between an oxidizing agent and a reducing agent is required. The oxidizing agents, the reducing agents and details of the system to be used are described in Literatures 1 and 2. Also, as described in the same Literatures, the photographic emulsion according to the present invention is also applicable for heat sensitive light sensitive photographic materials. For the light sensitive silver halide photographic material utilizing the photographic emulsion containing the hybrid silver halide grains of the present invention, the one bath developing bleach fixing processing and the color image reinforcing processing as disclosed in, for example, Japanese Provisional Patent Publications No. 20025 1977 and No. 30430 1977, and Japanese Provisional Patent Publications No. 126028 1979, No. 137332 1979, No. 161332 1979 and No. 161335 1979 may be used. The present invention now further described in the following Examples.

The pAg, pH and the addition rate of the solution D₁ 1 during the simultaneous mixing were controlled as shown in Table 4. The controlling of the pAg and pH were carried out by using a flow rate variable roller tube pump while varing the flow rates of the solution E₁ 1, the solution F₁ 1 and the solution B₁ 1. Two minutes after completion of the addition of the solution D₁ 1, pAg of the mixture was adjusted to 10.4 with the solution E₁ 1, and further 2 minutes later, adjusted to pH 6.0 with the solution F₁ 1.
