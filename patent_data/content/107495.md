# Combined refrigeration and heating circuits.

## Abstract
A combined refrigeration and heating circuit includes a compressor 10 , a condenser 20 , an evaporation 32 , a heating circuit for circulating heat transfer fluid heated by heat taken from the condenser 20 , pressure sensing means 85 for sensing the pressure of refrigerant in the inlet 18 to the condenser 20 in order to determine the amount of heat being taken therefrom, a heat exchanger 83 , and a variable speed fan 84 responsive to said sensing means 85 for additionally cooling the refrigerant to ensure complete condensation thereof if insufficient heat is being taken from the condenser 20 to allow condensation of refrigerant to be completed therein. A de superheater 16 is positioned between the compressor 10 and the condenser 20 and pump 89 circulates heat transfer fluid past the de superheater 16 to heat it to a temperature higher than fluid heated by the condenser 20 . The de superheater is by passed by refrigerant line 22 and a valve 14 controls the amount of refrigerant passing through the de superheater 16 in accordance with the demand for said heated fluid as sensed by temperature sensor 93 at the heated fluid outlet of the de superheater 16 .
