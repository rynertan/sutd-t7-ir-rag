Connected to the outlet port is a delivery catheter 40 for delivering the liquid medication to a site within the patient wherein the assembly is implanted. The pump also includes a fluid passage 24 which extends between the inlet and outlet port. A chamber 22 is provided along the fluid passage for containing a preselected volume of liquid medication to be delivered. A resilient deformable wall 18 on the pump extends over the chamber. A one way valve 28 is provided in the fluid passage between the input port and chamber for permitting fluid flow towards the chamber. A pressure regulated valve 36 is provided in the fluid passage between the chamber and outlet port for selectively permitting fluid flow through the delivery catheter upon actuation of the pump. A puncturable and resealable injec tion site 56 can also be part of the assembly and, when part of the assembly, is in fluid communication with the reservoir.
