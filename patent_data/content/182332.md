# Method of processing integrated circuits by photolithography.

## Abstract
In a method of processing integrated circuits, a polyme thyl methacrylate film 40 containing a selected dye and ex hibiting a strong dependence on light intensity is photo bleached to provide an optical mask to pattern an under lying photoresist layer 20 . While the film 40 is photo bleached, the underlying photoresists layer 20 is made to be substantially unaffected by the photobleaching process. When the optical mask is realized, it is used to mask the light sensitive photoresist layer 20 when the photoresist layer is exposed to light. The photobleached layer 40 , which is also sensitive to light, is now in turn made to be substantially unaffected by the exposure process. In this manner, the integrity of the optical mask resolution is main tained at its optimum, and densely integrated circuits can be processed and fabricated.
