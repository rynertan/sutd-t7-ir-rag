# MOISTURE RESISTANT COVER FOR AN ELECTROACOUSTIC TRANSDUCER

## Abstract
A capacitive type electroacoustic transducer is provided with a moisture resistant layer 34 to allow use of the transd ucer in wet environments. The moisture resistant layer is fastened over a protective cover 18 and is located at a node of the acoustic waves emitted by the transducer. A woven polytetrafluoroethylene material is preferably used for the moisture resistant properties as well as minimum attenuation of the acoustic waves.
