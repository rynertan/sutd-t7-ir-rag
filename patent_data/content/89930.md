## Claims
5Ã§EAT IS CLAIMED IS 1. A sole for sandal, clog and similar footwear, which is made up of a plurali y of strips linked to each other along complementary surfaces of articulation, and connected to each other by flexible elements which cross them along transverse through holes of said strips, and of two end members rigidly fixed to the two end strips. 2. A sole according to claim 1, in which the two end members present surfaces complementary to the outer ones of the end strips and are fixed thereto even by glueing. 3.

A sole for sandal, clog and similar footwear, as described and illustrated.

## Description
SOLE FOR SANDAL, CLOG AND SIMILAR FOOTWEAR, WITH TRANSVERSESTRIPS LINKED TO EACH OTHER The invention ras the nbjec to provide a sole for sandal, clog and similar footwear, which is made up of a plurality nf s rips lined tn each other along compleinen ary surfaces of articulation, said strips being connected to each other by flexible elements which cross them along transverse through holes formed in said strips and of two end members rigidly fixed to the two end strips. These end members are so shape as to complete the sole in the front and back part. The two end members present surfaces which are complementary to the external ones of the end strips, and are fixed thereto even by glueing. The surfaces,to which said end members are to be fixed, present notches able to house the ends for the anchoring of said flexible elements to the end strips. The drawing shows a possible embodiment of the invention and in particular Figs.1 and 2 schematically show a side view and a rlan view of a sole according to the invention Fig.3 shows a side view of the sole according to the invention, in an arcuate arrangement Fi.4 shows an enlarged, partly sectional, view of said sole according to a median plane parallel to the bearing surface Fig.5 shows a view sectioned according to lineV V of Fig.4 and Fig.6 shows, likewise Fig.2, an equivalent embo diment. As illustrated in the accompanying drawing, the sole according to the invention, generally indicated by 1, comprises a plurality of strips 3 articulated i.e. linked e each other in order to permit the sole to deform itself en the shoe is being worn the longitudinal dimensions of the strips 3 change along the sole so as to comply with its outer profile, while the cross dimensions are usually but not necessarily eQa o each other. The strips 3 are linked to each other along complementary surfaces of contact and articulation, so that each strip presente a convex surface 5 which is in contact with a corresponding concave surface 7 of the adjacent strip, all of them having a section according to an arc of circumference.The strips 3 present internally two transverse through holes 9 for the passage of a connecting flexible le ment 11. The flexible element 11 is a single one according to the example in the drawing, although two elements may be used in its place with the same result.The ends of the flexible element ii or of the t vo flexible elements instead are fixed to front and back end strips respectively denoted by 3A and 3P. In the drawing the flexible element 11 is constrained with both its ends 12 to the scrip 3P, and its central part 11C rests on the fron surface of the strip 3A between the two holes. The two ends 12 may be also welded to each other at 12A. The sole according to the invention is completed in the front and back part with two end indicated by 13 and 15 respectively, having an arcuate profile the end members 13 and 15 present surfaces conplei ientary to the external ones of the strips 3A and 3P respectively besides, they are rigidly fixed especially by gluing at least to the relevant end strip 3A and 33 respectively. In Figs.1 to 3 the member 15 is developed throughout the heel and instep zone, and may be shaped so as to provide an internal support for the foot arch. As the end 12 and central part 11C of the flexible element 11 result in a protruding arrangement with respect to the surfaces of the strips 3P and 3A, the end members 15 and 13 present, respectively, canal shaped notches or cavities 17 and 19 for receiving said ends 12 and said central part 110. In this way, the flexible element 11 or the flexible elements result completely inside the sole and thus protected and nn visible. A partial upper 25, of a type for sandal or clog, may be engaged to the strips 3A, 3, 3P, and it presents, advantageously, forwardsarcuate slots 22, which correspond to the connecting surfaces between adjacent strips this conformation keeps the upper substantially non deformed when the sole is curved. The advantages of the sole according o the invention are obvious From t ne point of view of the user cor2or, it has the advantages derived by its being articulated and hence flexible, while owing to the presence of the end members 13 and 15 a same sole may be suited to several shoe sizes. To adapt it to a smaller size, it is sufficient to reduce, by suitable means, the front nr back pro section of said end members which may be overdimensioned, within certain limits, and then reduced to obtain the smaller sizes. Further, as the flexible element 11 is not visible, the aesthetic problems of the product have been solved.
