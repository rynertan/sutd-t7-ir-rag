## Description
This invention relates to protector circuits for protecting communication equipments for analog or digital transmission systems from lightning surges applied to signal lines. Protector circuit standards for digital transmission systems with a transmission speed of 200 kb sec. are as follows. Fig. 1 shows a prior art protector circuit for switchboard analog circuits. The circuit comprises a series connection of resistor 14, fuse 15 and resistor 16 and another series connection of resistor 17, fuse 18 and resistor 19, these series connections being inserted in pair signal lines i.e., subscriber s line 12 and 13 connected to subscriber s communication equipment 11. Resistors 14 and 17 are grounded at the ends thereof opposite from switchboard 11 through a three electrode gas filled protector discharge tube 21. Resistors 16 and 19 are grounded at the both ends thereof through zinc oxide varistors 22 to 25. When a lightning surge voltage is applied to signal line 12, discharge is caused in the three electrode gas filled protector 21 between signal line 12 and ground. Due to the resultant discharge light or ions, the other side of the discharge tube 21 between signal line 13 and ground is triggered to discharge. The voltage on signal lines 12 and 13 consequently becomes the arc voltage of discharge tube 21, which is 20 to 50 V, thus protecting equipment 11 from the lightning surge voltage. The discharge trigger voltage and discharge delay time of the discharge tube, however, vary greatly, i.e., 300 to 800 V and 0.3 to 3.0 µsec., depending on the input surge voltage rising time. In addition, the response time of the three electrode gas filled protector is large. Before the discharge of discharge tube 21 is initiated, the lightning surge voltage appears across varistors 22 to 25, so that communication equipment 11 is protected by the on state voltage across varistors 22 to 25 until the sum of the on state voltage across varistors 22 and 24 and voltage drop across resistors 14 and 17 is sufficiently increased to start discharge of three electrode gas filled protector 21. In the protector circuit shown in Fig. 1, it is necessary to make up for fluctuations of the discharge characteristics of three electrode gas filled protector 21. Also, it is necessary to solve problems due to the delay of discharge. To ensure necessary surge protection characteristics, varistors, resistors, etc. are used. The circuit, therefore, comprises a large number of components and inevitably has a large size. In addition, the varistors should withstand high surge voltage, leading to an extra electrostatic capacitance. Fig. 2 shows another prior art protector circuit which is designed for digital transmission systems. This circuit uses, in lieu of varistors, series connections of a plurality of bilateral voltage limiting elements 26, e.g., bilateral zener diodes avalanche diodes are used. In order to reduce capacitance, the series connection of bilateral voltage limiting elements 26 is fabricated as a lamination. The lamination has a large number of layers and requires a complicated manufacturing process. Meanwhile, a varistor has a low voltage non linearity index. Therefore, even if a multi stage surge protection circuit is employed e.g., three stage in the case of Fig. 1 , the communication equipment 11 should be designed to have a high breakdown voltage to cover variation in limiting voltage of the varistor. While the protector circuits shown in Figs. 1 and 2 are actually used, there has been proposed a protector circuit, which does not use any lightning tube but uses thyristors, as shown in Fig. 3. This circuit is disclosed in U. S. patent No. 4,322,767 filed on February 11, 1980 entitled Bidirectional Solid State Protector Circuitry Using Gated Diode Switches . In this protector circuit, upon application of a positive lightning surge voltage to point A, the voltage at point 1200 is clamped by zener diode Z2 to a fixed voltage. At this time, zener diode Z3 is turned on so that the lightning surge voltage is applied to point 1800. The voltage at point 1800 thus exceeds the voltage at point 1200 to cause current to the gate of unidirectional thyristor GDSA, thus turning on the thyristor GDSA. When the applied lightning surge voltage is reduced, zener diode Z3 is turned off to turn off thyristor GDSA. Zener diodes Z1 and Z4 and thyristor GDSB are provided for negative lightning surge voltages. This protector circuit has a voltage detector, the output of which is fed to the gate of the thyristor to turn on the thyristor. The voltage detector includes a large number of components and has a complicated construction. In addition, zener diodes Z3 and Z4 can not be constructed as a single element. Fig. 3 shows only a portion of the circuit that is connected to signal line 12 shown in Fig. 1, that is, it is necessary to connect the same circuit to signal line 13. Further, zener diodes Z3 and Z4 are necessary for controlling the thyristor gate, and their breakdown voltage can not be determined in relation to the battery feed voltage on the signal line. Fig. 4 shows another prior art protector circuit disclosed in U. S. patent No. 4,282,555 filed on August 13, 1979 entitled Overvoltage Protection Means for Protecting Low Power Semiconductor Components . When the voltage on signal line A exceeds the sum of forward on voltage of diode D1 and break over voltage V Where the current versus voltage characteristic of power supplied to the communication equipment via signal lines is as shown by line 27 in Fig. 5, holding current I In the protector circuits shown in Figs. 3 and 4, an independently operable protector circuit is connected to each signal line. Therefore, when a lightning surge is applied with phase differences to a plurality of signal lines leading from a communication equipment or when there are fluctuations of the timing of start of operation of the protection circuits connected to the individual signal lines, a large transverse mode voltage is liable to be produced between signal lines through the communication equipment connected therebetween. Such a transverse mode voltage will cause rupture of the communication equipment. French patent No. 2,498,387 discloses a protector circuit according to the first portion of claim 1 and 2, respectively. In this circuit, a voltage detector is used to detect a surge voltage, and the detector output is used to simultaneously control the gates of bidirectional thyristors connected between the pair signal lines and ground, respectively, to simultaneously turn on the two thyristors. The transverse mode voltage noted above, therefore, is not generated in this case. However, the voltage detector for detecting the surge voltage is complicated. In addition, a delay is involved in the surge detection. Therefore, a grounded bidirectional voltage limiting element is connected between each signal line and ground to provide protection against surges until the thyristor is turned on. Therefore, an object of the invention is to provide a protector circuit having a short response time. Another object of the invention is to provide a protector circuit, which has less components and has a simpler construction so that it can be constructed in a small size, while also being applicable to high speed transmission systems. Another object of the invention is to provide a protector circuit, which has less components and a simpler construction and can prevent generation of a transverse mode voltage across an equipment having a plurality of signal lines. These objects are achieved with a protector circuit as claimed. According to one feature of the invention, a series connection of a bidirectional voltage limiting element and a two terminal bidirectional thyristor, is inserted between each signal line connected to a communication equipment and ground. Breakdown voltage V The gate terminals of the individual bidirectional thyristors are connected together and held open without being connected to any other part. When the bidirectional voltage limiting element and bidirectional thyristor in one of the series connections in this structure are turned on with a lightning surge, the gate cathode voltage on this thyristor is applied as a control signal to the gate terminals of the other bidirectional thyristors that are connected to the gate terminal noted above, so that these thyristors are also turned on. Thus, there is no possibility of generation of a transverse mode voltage. According to another feature of the invention, a circuit consisting of a first bidirectional voltage limiting element, a three terminal bidirectional thyristor connected in series with the first bidirectional voltage limiting element and a second bidirectional voltage limiting element connected between the gate and anode terminals of the bidirectional thyristor, is connected between each signal line of communication equipment and ground. Breakdown voltage V The gates of the individual bidirectional thyristors are connected together. With this arrangement, the generation of a transverse mode voltage can be prevented. In the above individual features of the invention, in case where a commercial power line is connected to the communication equipment, application of a lightning surge voltage to the equipment may be prevented by connecting a three terminal bidirectional thyristor between the commercial power line and ground and connecting the gate terminal of this thyristor to the gate terminals of the bidirectional thyristors connected between the signal lines and ground. In this way, it is possible to prevent a transverse mode voltage form being generated between the commercial power line and signal lines. Fig. 6 shows an embodiment of protector circuit according to the invention. Protector circuit 31 according to the invention is connected between signal line 12 leading form equipment 11, i.e., a communication equipment, and ground. Protector circuit 31 comprises bidirectional voltage limiting element 32 and two terminal bidirectional thyristor 33 in series therewith. Bidirectional voltage limiting element 32 may be a bidirectional zener diode avalanche diode , a varistor, etc. Bidirectional thyristor 33 may be a SSS silicon symmetrical switch element without any gate terminal. Or it may be a triac with an open gate terminal i.e., with the gate terminal connected to nowhere . Bidirectional voltage limiting element 32 has breakdown voltage V It is now assumed that V Particularly, energy loss in bidirectional thyristor 33 is only 0.174 J. Therefore, bidirectional thyristor 33 may have as small chip area as about 4 mm, and also its capacitance C With breakdown voltage V Referring to Fig. 7A, the shaded area on the right side of line 37 for V V The protector circuit thus can be employed for high speed, wide bandwidth communication purposes. With the protector circuit according to the invention the capacitance with respect to surge withstanding capability 10 1000 µs is as shown by plot 41 in Fig. 8, whereas with the prior art protector circuit shown in Fig. 1 it is so high as shown at point 43, roughly double the value according to the invention. Further, according to the invention, unlike the case where a surge voltage is detected and the detection output is used to turn on thyristors, only two components are necessary in the structure of Fig. 6. In other words, according to the invention fewer components are needed compared to the prior art structure, that is, the construction is simpler and can be fabricated more inexpensively. Further, the circuit may be designed to comply with various different standards by suitably selecting breakdown voltage V Further, unlike the case where a surge voltage is detected by a surge voltage detector and the output thereof is used to turn on thyristors, according to the invention the lightning surge voltage is applied directly to the thyristor. Thus, it is possible to quickly respond to the lightning surge voltage application and hold operating voltage fluctuations within about 10 V, permitting operating voltage V Further, zinc oxide varistors may be used for bidirectional voltage limiting element 32 to provide the protector circuit inexpensively. A zinc oxide varistor has a low voltage non linearity index. The limit voltage, therefore, has dependency on the high input lightning surge voltage. Assuming the breakdown voltage V Further, according to this protector circuit, the continual current is cut by the bidirectional voltage limiting element. Therefore, the normal state, e.g., communication state, can be quickly restored after the lightning surge application, that is, the communication interruption period can be reduced. Furthermore, unlike the multi stage protection circuit shown in Fig. 1, no resistor is connected in series with the signal line. It is thus possible to reduce transmission loss and increase transmission distance. Where signal lines 12 and 13 connected to equipment 11 are return trip lines, series connection 47 of bidirectional voltage limiting element 45 and bidirectional thyristor 46 may be connected between signal line 13 and ground just like series connection 31 of bidirectional voltage limiting element 32 and bidirectional thyristor 33 is connected between signal line 12 and ground, as shown in Fig. 9. In this case, in order to prevent equipment 11 from rupture of operation which would be caused by application of a lightning surge through equipment 11 due to phase difference in the lightning surge on signal lines 12 and 13, the gate terminals of bidirectional thyristors 33 and 46 may be connected together by line 48. Line 48 is connected to no other part, that is, the gate terminals are held open. When bidirectional voltage limiting element 32 and bidirectional thyristor 33 are turned on by application of a lightning surge voltage to signal line 12, a voltage is generated between the gate and cathode terminals of bidirectional thyristor 33 due to current therein. This voltage is fed through line 48 to the gate terminal of the other bidirectional thyristor 46 to turn on this bidirectional thyristor 46. Thus, application of a lagging phase lightning surge voltage to signal line 13 will not result in the generation of any transverse mode voltage between signal lines 12 and 13, so that equipment 11 can be protected. In the example of Fig. 9, fuses 15 and 18 are inserted in series in respective signal lines 12 and 13. With this arrangement, when a 200 V commercial power supply voltage appears between signal lines 12 and 13, the components of series connections 31 and 47 are turned on, and short circuit of the components is caused by the resultant current therein so that equipment 11 is protected. But even if open circuit of series connections 31 and 47 is caused, equipment 11 is protected by the disconnection of fuses 15 and 18. Where equipment 11 is connected to input signal lines 12 and 13 and output signal lines 51 and 52 like a submarine repeater, series connections 31, 47, 53 and 54 each consisting of a bidirectional voltage limiting element and a bidirectional thyristor are each connected between each of signal lines 12, 13, 51 and 52 and ground as shown in Fig. 10. Further, to prevent generation of a transverse mode voltage between signal lines 12, 13, 51 and 52, gate terminals of the bidirectional thyristors in series connections 31, 47, 53 and 54 are connected to line 48, which is connected to no other part to hold the gate terminals open. Input signal lines 12 and 13 are connected to the input side of LSI repeater 57 through transformer 55 and impedance matching element 56. The output side of repeater 57 is connected to output signal lines 51 and 52 through transformer 58. Zener diode 59 is connected between a primary side center tap of transformer 55 and a secondary side center tap of transformer 58. The terminal voltage across zener diode 59 is applied as power source voltage to repeator 57. In the above example of Fig. 10, each bidirectional thyristor is turned on through break over by a lightning surge voltage. Alternatively, the gate terminal of the bidirectional thyristo may be controlled to turn on the thyristor. Fig. 11 shows such an example. In this example, a series connection of bidirectional voltage limiting element 61 and three terminal bidirectional thyristor 62 is connected between signal line 12 and ground, and bidirectional voltage limiting element 63 is connected between the gate and anode terminals of bidirectional thyristor 62. Bidirectional voltage limiting elements 61 and 63 and bidirectional thyristor 62 constitute protector circuit 64. Sum V When a lightning surge voltage is applied to signal line 12, voltage limiting elements 61 and 63 are simultaneously turned on through breakdown. The current thus caused is fed to the gate terminal of bidirectional thyristor 62 to turn on the thyristor, whereby equipment 11 is protected against the lightning surge. When the lightning surge voltage is reduced to become lower than breakdown voltage V Now, the manner in which the lightning surge voltage applied to equipment 11 with time will be described with reference to Fig. 12, where it is assumed that bidirectional avalanche diodes are used for bidirectional voltage limiting elements 61 and 63 of protector circuit 64. In the absence of protector circuit 64 connected to signal line 12, the lightning surge voltage which is applied to equipment 11 becomes high as shown by dashed plot 50a to cause dielectric breakdown of equipment 11. With protector circuit 64 connected to signal line 12, as soon as the input lightning surge voltage reaches 150 V which is sum of breakdown voltages V Now, energy loss in protector circuit 64 will be considered. Let it be assumed that a current of 50 A peak i.e., lightning surge peak voltage of 5,000 V divided by signal line surge impedance of 100 Ω with a lightning surge waveform of 10 1,000 µsec. flows on the circuit. The on period of bidirectional avalanche diode 63 is as short as about 0.1 sec., and energy loss caused in this element is about 0.1 mJ. The on voltage V Where a plurality of signal lines are connected to equipment 11, protector circuits 64 and 65 may be connected between signal lines 12 and 13 and a grounding terminal, as shown in Fig. 13. Protector circuits 64 and 65 have the same construction. In this example, the gate terminals of bidirectional thyristors 62 of protector circuits 64 and 65 are connected together by line 48. Line 48 is connected to no other part to hold the gate terminals of bidirectional thyristors 62 and 66 open. In the case where a lightning surge is applied to either one of signal lines 12 and 13, it will be appreciated that the protector circuit of Fig. 13 can also protect equipment 11 in a similar manner explained with respect to the circuit shown in Fig. 11. In the case where a lightning surge is simultaneously applied to signal lines 12, 13, there would be no fear of applying an overvoltage to equipment 11 either between signal lines 12, 13 and ground or between signal lines 12 and 13. When a lightning surge is applied to signal line 12 and also to signal line 13 with a time lag behind the former, for example, to turn on bidirectional voltage limiting elements 61, 63, the on current at that moment flows into gates of both bidirectional thyristors 62, 66 to turn them on simultaneously, thus protecting equipment 11. Alternatively the turning on of bidirectional voltage limiting elements 61, 63 causes to turn on bidirectional thyristor 62 and the gate cathode voltage of bidirectional thyristor 62 caused by the on current thereof is applied across the gate and cathode of bidirectional thyristor 66 to turn it on. Since the time interval between the turn on of thyristors 62 and 66 is extremely short, the protector circuit shown in Fig. 13 can protect equipment 11 from lightning surge voltages on signal lines 12, 13 having a phase difference therebetween, that is, from transverse mode voltage. Where a series connection of a bidirectional thyristor and a bidirectional voltage limiting element is connected between each of signal lines and ground and the gate terminals of the individual bidirectional thyristors are connected together as shown in Figs. 9, 10 and 13, the bidirectional thyristors are preferably provided on the ground side with respect to the bidirectional voltage limiting elements. Although the bidirectional voltage limiting elements may be provided on the ground side, in this case the mutually connected bidirectional thyristors may fail to be turned on simultaneously if the fluctuations of the breakdown voltages of the bidirectional voltage limiting elements are excessive. In case of equipment 11 using a commercial power supply such as a facsimile apparatus, equipment 11 may be connected to commercial power lines not shown through connector 84, as shown in Fig. 14. In this case, a lightning surge is applied to equipment 11 via signal line 12 and also via power line. Since the signal line and power line are laid along different routes, lightning surge reaches equipment 11 with different waveforms and at different phases via the signal line and power line, respectively. That is, a transverse mode voltage is generated between the signal line and power line. Accordingly, power lines 85 and 86 connected to connector 84 of equipment 11 are grounded through respective bidirectional voltage limiting elements 87 and 88 and then through common bidirectional thyristor 89. The gate terminal of bidirectional thyristor 89 in the power supply side protector circuit and the gate terminal of bidirectional thyristor 33 in protector circuit 31 on the side of signal line 12 are connected together with line 91. It will be understood that with this arrangement no transverse mode voltage will be applied across equipment 11 in the events of a lightning surge applied to signal line and also that applied to power line. The connection point between bidirectional voltage limiting elements 87 and 88 is connected to a primary center tap of a transformer of equipment 11. Similar connections may be used in the other protector circuits according to the invention so long as commercial power lines are connected to equipment 11, as shown by dashed lines in Fig. 13, for instance.
