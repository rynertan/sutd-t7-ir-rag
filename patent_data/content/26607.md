# Epoxy resin powder for wire coating and method of applying an electrical insulating coating to wire.

## Abstract
Powder useful for applying coatings to wire, which coatings when cured have good electrical insulating values, good resistance to physical stresses such as thermal shock, and good chemical resistance, the novel powder being a blend of a polyglycidyl ether capped with monobasic aromatic acid such as benzoic acid and b trimellitic anhydride.
