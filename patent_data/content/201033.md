## Description
The present invention relates to the method for processing silver halide color photographic materials and particularly to the method for processing silver halide color photographic materials capable of improving remarkably the processing variation in the color development and of realizing the low environmental pollution. Generally, color photographic materials produce thereon photographic images after they pass through the processing steps including a color developing step wherein color photographic materials, after they are exposed to light, are processed in the developer containing paraphenylene type color developing agent, a bleaching step and a fixing step or a bleach fix step in place of previous two steps and a washing step. In aforesaid color developing step, color images are formed by the coupling reaction between an oxidation product of color developing agent and a color coupler and metallic silver are concurrently produced in the photographic step. The metallic silver are oxidized by bleaching agents in the succeeding desilverizing step and then form, through the aid of fixing agents, the soluble silver complexes which are dissolved away. From EP A 0 029 722 it is known to process an exposed colour photographic material comprising a hydrophilic colloidal layer of a silver halide emulsion, a coupler and a colour developing agent. The material is processed in a colour developer which is replenished with a colour developing agent. Researches for low environmental pollution have been made recently from the viewpoints of an environmental protection and a cost and have been put to practical use in a partial processing steps. Especially in the color developing step, various technologies for low environmental pollution have been proposed in the past due to the level of an influence of the color developing step upon environmental pollution. For example, regenerating methods through an electrolysis described in Japanese Patent Publication Open to Public Inspection Nos. 37731 1979, 1048 1981, 1049 1981, 27142 1981, 33644 1981 and 149036 1981 hereinafter referred to as Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication , generating methods by means of activated carbon described in Japanese Patent Examined Publication No. 1571 1980 and Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 14831 1983, an ion exchange membrane method described in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 105820 1977 and methods by means of an ion exchange resin described in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 132343 1978, 144240 1980, 146249 1982 and U.S. Patent No. 4,348,475 and disclosed. However, aforesaid methods require a large and expensive regenerating apparatus and a skilled person who can analyze regenerating liquid for keeping the development level constant and therefore the methods are not utilized except an occasion where the methods are used by only a few photofinishing laboratories. Recently, on the other hand, a method for reducing waste liquid not by using a regenerating method but by reducing replenisher for the color developer has become popular. This method does not require a large and expensive apparatus and a skilled analyzer and therefore it is a desirable method for achieving low environmental pollution, which is different from aforesaid methods. Through this method, it is possible to attain a low replenishment to a certain extent but this method has serious disadvantages such as the condensation of color developer caused by evaporation, mixing of iron salt and thiosulfate caused by the belt contamination and back contamination and a large process variation and a large process stain both caused by the substances eluted from the emulsion such as, for example, an outflow of activator and inhibitor. This tendency is remarkable especially when the low replenishment is accelerated under the conditions of high temperature processing and low volume processing. As a technology for preventing the process variation caused by iron salt and thiosulfate both mixed into color developer during the low replenishment, various types of chelating agents are disclosed and further polyvinyl pirrolidone type compounds and polyethylene glycol type compounds are disclosed in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 150847 1982, 120250 1983 and 121036 1983, but all of them only prevent iron salt and thiosulfate both in a small amount to be mixed and they are not so effective when the low replenishment is accelerated and the amount level of iron salt and thiosulfate mixed into color developer is high. Further, when aforesaid chelating agents and polyvinyl pirrolidone type and polyethylene glycol type high molecular compounds are added in abundance, the photographic characteristics of photosensitive materials are adversely affected, which is not desirable. An object of the invention is to improve greatly the process variation for silver halide photographic materials caused by the low replenishment and another object is to attain a remarkable low environmental pollution through a simple and inexpensive method. Further object of the invention is to provide a processing method capable of forming a color photographic image that is high sensitive and is excellent in its image quality. After an enthusiastic study, the inventors of the present invention found that the processing of silver halide color photographic material having at least one layer of core shell emulsion containing 3 mol or more of silver iodide and containing magenta coupler represented by following general formula I is attained by replenishing 9 ml and less of the replenisher for color development containing 3.0 x 10 ³ mol and less of bromides per 100 cm² of silver halide color photographic material. In the formula, Z represents a nonmetallic atom group necessary for forming a nitrogen containing heterocyclic ring and a ring formed by said Z may have a substituent. X represents a hydrogen atom or a substituent capable of splitting off through the reaction with an oxidized substance of color developing agent. R, on the other hand, represents a hydrogen atom or a substituent. Further, the embodiments of the invention wherein chelating agents represented by following general formulas XI XIII are contained and further 2.0 x 10 ³ mol and less of bromides are contained in the replenisher for color development and aforesaid replenisher for color development in the amount of 7.5 ml and less is replenished per 100 cm² of silver halide color photographic material, show remarkable effects of the invention. In the formulas, A and B represent respectively a monovalent group or an atom and they may be either an inorganic substance or an organic one. D represents a group of non metal atoms necessary for forming an aromatic cyclic ring or a heterocyclic ring which may have a substituent and M represents a hydrogen atom or an alkali metal atom. Following is a detailed description of the invention. The inventors of the invention found that the process variation and process stain for color photographic materials grow large when the low replenishment is made for realizing a low environmental pollution and a low cost and especially when 9 ml and less of the replenisher for color development is replenished for processing per 100 cm² of silver halide color photographic material, the process variation grows large remarkably. Generally, color photographic materials containing silver iodide such as, for example, color negative films like color photographic materials for use in photographing require the replenishment of about 15 ml of the replenisher for color development per 100 cm² of the color photographic material. In this case, there is no big problem except mixing of ingredients from a previous bath such as iron salt and thiosulfate because the amount of replenishment is large. However, when the amount of replenishment is lowered down to 9 ml and below, the problems including the condensation of color developer caused by the evaporation and the accumulation of the substances eluted from the emulsion take place and especially, the density variation of a green sensitive layer and stain tend to be caused, which was found by the inventors of the invention. Therefore, it is necessary to prevent the condensation of color developer caused by evaporation or to prevent the influence on color photographic material to some extent despite the condensation and further it is necessary to prevent or to control constant the accumulation of the substances eluted from emulsion, especially of alkali salt halide. A lower replenishment has hitherto been impossible because no solutions for the aforesaid problems have been found out. However, with silver halide color photographic material having at least one emulsion layer containing core shell type silver halide grains holding 3 mol or more of silver iodide and containing magenta coupler represented by general formula I , the low replenishment of 0.5 to 9 ml 100 cm² has been realized by keeping bromides in the replenisher for color development at 3.0 x 10 ³ mol per liter and less and by maintaining at bromide concentration which causes no problem in the color development. Further detailed description of the invention will be made as follows. The replenishing amount of replenisher for color development of the invention is 0.5 to 9 ml 100 cm² and less but when the evaporating amount is taken into consideration, the range from 1 to 9 ml 100 cm² in replenishment is preferable and the range from 3 to 8 ml 100 cm² is especially preferable. With regard to the replenishing method, the replenisher for color development is replenished through a known method but it is recommendable to use a metering pump such as a bellows pump. The replenisher for color development of the invention contains 0 to 3.0 x 10 ³ mol per liter and less of bromides and it is necessary to adjust the concentration of bromide depending on the level of low replenishment. In general, it is necessary to reduce the concentration of bromide contained in the replenisher for color development as a replenishing amount is reduced. The concentration of bromide in the replenisher for color development is adjusted so that the concentration of bromide mainly determined by elution from emulsion and evaporation is kept constant, and when the concentration of bromide is 3.0 x 10 ³ mol per liter and less and the amount of the replenisher for color development is within the range of from 0.5 to 9 ml 100 cm² a stable processing can be achieved without so affecting any photographic characteristics. As an actual compound of bromide, there may be given an alkali metal salt such as sodium bromide, potassium bromide and ammonium bromide as well as hydrobromic acid.

As for a bleaching solution in the invention, air or oxygen is allowed to be blown in the bleach fix bath and in the storage tank for bleach fix replenisher at need for enhancing the activity of a bleach fix solution, or proper oxidizing agents such as, for example, hydrogen peroxide, bromate, persulfate or the like may be added according to circumstances. In the processing of the invention, the silver recovery may be carried out from processing solution containing soluble silver complex salts such as a fixer and a bleach fix solution as well as the washing water or a stabilizer of the substitute for washing. For example, an electrolysis method French Patent No. 2,299,667 , a precipitation method Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 73037 1977, West German Patent No. 2,331,220 , an ion exchange method Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 17114 1976 and West German Patent No. 2,548,237 and a metal substitution method British Patent No. 1,353,805 are utilized effectively. After the bleaching process and fixing process or bleach fix process following the color developing process in the invention, either the case wherein no washing is conducted and the substitutive process for washing is carried out or the case wherein washing is conducted and then the substitutive stabilizing process for washing is carried out is allowed. In addition to the aforesaid processes, known auxiliary processes such as the processes for hardening, neutralizing, black and white developing, reversal and washing with a small quantity of water may be added at need. Typical concrete examples of preferable processing method include the following processes. A core shell emulsion used for the invention is described in detail in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 154232 1982. In the invention, a core shell structural silver halide grain contains not less than 3 mol of silver iodide and in the preferable color photographic material, the composition of a core in terms of silver halide is that the silver halide contains 0.1 20 mol , preferably 0.5 10 mol of silver iodide and a shell consists of silver bromide, silver chloride, silver iodobromide, silver chlorobromide or the mixture of the foregoing. What is preferable in particular is that a shell is a silver halide emulsion consisting of silver bromide or silver iodobromide. Further, in the invention, a preferable effect may be achieved when a core is a monodispersed silver halide grain and the thickness of a shell is 0.01 0.5 µm. A silver halide color photographic material of the invention is characterized in that it consists of silver halide grains containing not less than 3 mol of silver iodide and silver halide grains containing silver iodide are used especially as a core thereof and the nature toward the high sensitivity of silver halide grains containing silver iodide is put to practical use by covering the core of a silver halide grain consisting of silver bromide, silver chloride, silver chlorobromide, silver iodobromide or the mixture of the foregoing using the shell having aforesaid specific thickness and further the process variation is improved by hiding the disadvantageous nature of aforesaid grains. More particularly, a core of silver halide containing silver iodide is given a shell having the strictly regulated range of its thickness necessary for bringing out effectively only the preferable nature of the core and for hiding the unpreferable behavior of the core. The method for covering with a shell having the absolute thickness that is necessary and minimum for bringing out effectively the nature owned by the core may also be utilized extensively for the purposes of improving the process variation, the life or the spectral sensitizer absorbing property by changing the purpose, namely changing the material of the shell, which is advantageous to a great extent. A silver iodide content in a matrix of silver halide grain core ranges from the solid solution of 0.1 20 mol to the mixed crystal and it preferably is within the range from 0.5 mol to 10 mol . The distribution in the core of silver iodide contained may either be an omnipresent state or a uniform state and the uniform distribution is preferable. A silver halide emulsion of the invention containing a silver halide grain having a shell with a specific thickness may be manufactured by covering with aforesaid shell the core of silver halide grain contained in a monodispersed emulsion. Incidentally, it is preferable that the ratio of silver iodide to silver bromide in the case that a shell is silver iodobromide is 10 mol and less. When causing a core to be a monodispersed silver halide grain, it is possible to obtain a grain having the desired size through a double jet method wherein the pAg is kept constant. Further, for manufacturing a silver halide emulsion having a high level monodispersibility, it is possible to use the method disclosed in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 48521 1979. The preferable embodiment among aforesaid methods is to manufacture, by adding potassium iodobromide gelatin solution and ammoniacal silver nitrate solution into gelatin solution containing silver halide seed grains through the adding method wherein the adding speed changes as a function of time. In this case, it is possible to obtain a silver halide emulsion having a high level dispersibility by selecting properly the function of time for adding speed, pH, pAg, temperature or the like. A monodispersed core shell emulsion in the invention is preferably used and monodispersed silver halide grains mean silver halide grains wherein the weight of silver halide whose grain size is within the range of 20 of the average grain size The grain size mentioned here is a diameter of a silver halide grain when the silver halide grain is spherical, while, when it is of a shape other than a spherical shape, the grain size is a diameter of a circle image converted from the projected image of the grain and having the same area as that of projected image. The grain size is obtained by photographing the grain through an electron microscope with a magnification of 10,000 times to 50,000 times and by measuring the grain diameter or the area of a projected image on the print. The number of grains to be measured is 1000 or more selected through the random sampling. A monodispersed silver halide emulsion used in the invention gives an effect that the density variation in the high density portion is made smaller compared with a polydisperse emulsion, which is a preferable embodiment in the working of the invention. As for the thickness of a shell that covers a core, it is required to be the thickness which does not hide the preferable nature of the core and does hide the unpreferable nature thereof. Namely, the thickness is limited to a narrow range between the upper limit and the lower one. Such shell may be formed in a way wherein soluble halide solution and soluble silver salt solution are treated through a double jet method to be deposited in a form of a monodispersed core. For example, in the experiment wherein monodispersed silver halide grains having an average grain size of 1 µm and containing silver iodide of 3 mol in the core were used and the covering thickness of 0.2 mol silver iodobromide which is a shell was changed variously, when the shell having the thickness of 0.85 µm was prepared, the covering power of monodispersed silver halide grains in the aforesaid method was too low to be put to practical use. This was treated in the processing bath containing a solvent capable of dissolving silver halide and having a physical development property and then was observed under a scanning type electron microscope which proved that no filament of developed silver appeared. This suggests that the optical density is lowered and the covering power is further lowered. Therefore, it was tried, taking the form of a filament of developed silver into consideration, that the thickness of a shell of silver bromide on the surface was gradually thinned while changing the average grain size of a core. As the result of aforesaid trial, it was found that many excellent filaments of developed silver were produced and thereby sufficient optical densities were obtained and nevertheless the nature of high sensitivity of the core was not deteriorated, independently of the average grain size of a core but dependently on an absolute thickness of a shell of 0.5 µm and less preferably, 0.2 µm and less . When the thickness of a shell is too thin, on the other hand, there are produced portions where the foundation of a core containing silver iodide is bared and thereby the effects of covering the surface with shells, namely, the effect of chemical sensitization and the property of quick development, fixing or the like are lost. It is preferable that the limit of the thickness is 0.01 µm. When confirmed by the high monodispersed core, the preferable thickness of a core ranges from 0.01 µm to 0.06 µm and the most preferable thickness is 0.03 µm and below. Aforesaid effects that sufficient filaments of developed silver are produced and thereby the chemical density is improved, the sensitizing effect is achieved by making the best use of the nature of a core toward the high sensitivity and the property of quick development and fixing is obtained, are caused by the shell whose thickness is regulated, as mentioned above, by the high monodispersed core and by the synergetic effect between the silver halide composition of core and shell. Provided that the regulation of shell thickness is satisfied, silver iodobromide, silver bromide, silver chloride, silver chlorobromide or the mixture thereof may be used as silver halide constituting aforesaid shell. Among them, silver bromide, silver iodobromide or the mixture thereof are preferable from the viewpoints of a congeniality with a core, process stability and process stain or of a life. When silver halide of core and shell is produced in a form of precipitation and when grains thereof grow or after the completion of the growth, a photosensitive silver halide emulsion used in the invention may be doped with various types of metallic salts or metal complexes. For example, metallic salts or complexes of gold, platinum, palladium, iridium, rhodium, bismuth, cadmium and copper or the mixture thereof may be applied. Further, excess halogenated compounds produced during the preparation of an emulsion of the invention or salts such as a nitrate, ammonium or the like and compounds which are produced as a secondary product or have become unnecessary may be eliminated. As an eliminating method, noodle washing method, a dialysis method or a coagulating method, all of which are commonly used for general emulsions may be used at need. Further, various types of chemical sensitizing methods used for general emulsions may be applied to the emulsion of the invention. Namely, through chemical sensitizing agents like reduction sensitizer such as active gelatin noble metal sensitizer such as water soluble gold salt, water soluble platinum salt, water soluble palladium salt, water soluble rhodium salt and water soluble iridium salt sulfur sensitizer selenium sensitizer polyamine and stannous chloride, it is possible to carry out the chemical sensitization using one of aforesaid chemical sensitizers or using plural chemical sensitizers mentioned above in combination. It is further possible to carry out the optical sensitization for the desired wavelength range on the silver halide. There is no restriction in particular in the optical sensitizing methods for the emulsion of the invention, and, for example, optical sensitizers such as cyan dye like zerometin dye, cyan dye like trimetin dye or merocyanine dye may be used individually or in combination thereof e.g. strong color sensitization for the optical sensitization. These technologies are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,688,545, 2,912,329, 3,397,060, 3,615,635 and 3,628,964, British Patent Nos. 1,195,302, 1,242,588 and 1,293,862, West German OLS Patent Nos. 2,030,326 and 2,121,780 and Japanese Patent Examined Publication Nos. 4936 1968 and 14030 1969. The selection may freely be made from aforesaid technologies according to the purpose and application for the photosensitive material, such as the wavelength range to be sensitized, the sensitivity and others. As for the silver halide emulsion to be used in the invention, a monodispersed silver halide emulsion wherein shells are mostly uniform in thickness is obtained by using the silver halide emulsion in which core particles are represented by monodispersed silver halide grains and by coating aforesaid core particle with a shell, when forming silver halide grains to be further contained. Such monodispersed silver halide emulsion may be used either without changing its grain size distribution or with blending, for obtaining desired gradient, 2 or more kinds of monodispersed emulsions having different average grain sizes each other at an optional moment after forming grains. As for the silver halide emulsion used in the invention, the one containing silver halide grains of the invention at the rate identical to or higher than that of the emulsion obtained by covering with shells monodispersed cores having the distribution area of 20 and less against total silver halide grains contained in the emulsion wherein the ratio of the silver halide grains of the invention to the total silver halide grains contained in the emulsion is identical to or higher than that of the emulsion obtained by covering with shells the monodispersed cores having the distribution area of 20 and less is preferable. However, silver halide grains other than the invention are allowed to be contained within the range that the effect of the invention is not impeded. Aforesaid silver halide other than the invention is allowed to be either of a core shell type or of a non core shell type and it is further allowed to be either monodispersed one or polydispersed one. In the silver halide emulsion used in the invention, it is preferable that at least 65 by weight of silver halide grains contained in aforesaid emulsion is the silver halide grains of the invention and it is desirable that almost all of silver halide grains in the emulsion are the silver halide grains of the invention. As for other couplers for photographic use used in the invention, phenol type compounds and naphthol type compounds are preferable as a cyan coupler and they may be selected from the ones described, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,369,929, 2,434,272, 2,474,293, 2,895,826, 3,253,924, 3,034,892, 3,311,476, 3,386,301, 3,419,390, 3,458,315 and 3,591,383 which also include synthesizing methods for those compounds.

Further, the colored magenta coupler of the type wherein dyes flow out into processing solution during the reaction with oxidants of developing agents, which is identical to the one described in U.S. Patent No. 3,419,391 is allowed to be used. As a yellow coupler for photographic use, open chain ketomethylene compounds have been used and it is possible to use a benzoylacetanilide type yellow coupler and a pivaloylacetanilide type yellow coupler both of which are widely used. Further, a 2 equivalent type yellow coupler wherein a carbon atom in a coupling position is substituted with a substituent capable of splitting off during a coupling reaction may also be used advantageously. The examples of aforesaid yellow coupler are described together with synthesizing methods thereof in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,875,057, 3,265,506, 3,664,841, 3,408,194, 3,277,155, 3,447,928, 3,415,652, Japanese Patent Examined Publication No. 13576 1974, Japanese Patent O.P.I.

An amount of aforesaid diffusion proof coupler used in the invention is generally 0.05 mol 2.0 mol per 1 mol of silver in a photosensitive silver halide emulsion layer. In the invention, DIR compounds are preferably used in addition to aforesaid diffusion proof couplers. Furthermore, in addition to DIR compounds, the compounds which discharge development inhibitors during the development are also included in the invention and the examples thereof are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,297,445 and 3,379,529, West German OLS Patent No. 2,417,914, Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 15271 1977, 9116 1978, 123838 1984 and 127038 1984. DIR compounds used in the invention are the compounds capable of reacting on oxidants of developing agent and thereby discharging development inhibitors. As a typical one of aforesaid DIR compounds, there is given a DIR coupler wherein a group capable of forming, when splitting from a coupling position, a compound having a development inhibiting action is substituted to the coupling position of the coupler and the examples thereof are described in British Patent No. 935,454, U.S. Patent Nos. 3,227,554, 4,095,984 and 4,149,886. Aforesaid DIR coupler has a property that the coupler parent group of the DIR coupler, during the coupling reaction on oxidants of developing agent, forms a dye and discharges, on the other hand, a development inhibitor. The present invention further includes the compounds which discharge, during the coupling reaction on oxidants of developing agents as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,652,345, 3,928,041, 3,958,993, 3,961,959 and 4,052,213, Japanese Patent O.P.I.

The invention will be explained as follows in detail referring to the examples which do not limit the embodiments of the invention. A multilayer color photosensitive material having, on its support of cellulose triacetate film, the layers each of which has a composition shown below was prepared. First layer antihalation layer Aforesaid photosensitive materials were processed continuously by an automatic processor according to the following steps. The automatic processor used was a modified suspension type Film Automatic Processor Type H4 220W 2 made by Noritsu Koki Co. The composition of color developer used was as follows. The composition of replenisher for color development was as follows. The composition of bleaching solution used was as follows. The composition of replenisher for bleaching used was as follows. The composition of fixer used was as follows. The composition of replenisher for fixing was as follows. The composition of stabilizing solution used was as follows. The replenisher for color development was replenished to the color developing bath in the amount of 8.0 ml per 100 cm² of color negative film, the replenisher for bleaching was replenished to the bleaching bath in the amount of 18 ml per 100 cm² of color negative film, the replenisher for fixing was replenished to the fixing bath in the amount of 7 ml per 100 cm² of color negative film and further the replenisher for stabilizing was replenished to the stabilizing bath in the amount of 11 ml per 100 cm² of color negative film. Further, water in the amount of 30 ml per 100 cm² of color negative film was replenished to the washing bath of small amount of water and water in the amount of 150 ml per 100 cm² of color negative film was poured to the washing bath. The color negative film in the amount of 1000 m² was continuously processed with a fixing bath whose pH value was kept at 6.5 constantly through the continuous processing by adding ammonium hydroxide or acetic acid properly to aforesaid replenisher for fixing. On the other hand, with the purpose of comparing, 1000 m² of the respective samples were continuously processed in a developing process for which a relatively larger amount of developing replenishers are used, which has so far popularly been used. Hereinafter called a CNK 4 standard process. Such CNK 4 process is the same as the process used in the aforementioned experiments, except that an amount of sodium bromide used in the developing solution, a concentration of sodium bromide used in the developing replenisher and the replenishing amount thereof are changed to those indicated below At the points of time when starting and completing the continuous process of 1000 m² each of the samples, the light sensitive characteristics thereof were measured in such a manner that they were exposed to white light through a step wedge by making use of a photosensitometer, Model KS 7, manufactured by KONISHIROKU PHOTO INDUSTRY CO., LTD., Japan, and then processed. On each of the samples, an ordinary scene was taken by making use of a camera, Model FS 1, manufactured by KONISHIROKU PHOTO INDUSTRY CO., LTD., Japan. The characteristics of the samples each obtained at the point of time when starting the processing were almost the same therebetween, however, every sample was observed some variations in their characteristics at the point of time when 1000 m² each of them were processed. Table 2 exhibits the respective results obtained from the samples, with respect to the absolute values of the gamma difference Δγ and the minimum density difference ΔD In the density measurements, the green light transmission density of each sample was measured by making use of a SAKURA Optical Densitometer, Model PDA 65, manufactured by KONISHIROKU PHOTO INDUSTRY CO., LTD., Japan. As is apparent from the results shown in Table 2 , it is understood that the Sample Nos. 15 and 16 each using the Emulsions D and I of the invention, which are of the core shell type, comprising a silver halide that is silver iodobromide containing not less than 3 mol iodine and the Exemplified couplers of the invention to serve as the couplers such samples have almost no difference in processing variation and in minimum density variation when processed in the process of the invention and even when processed in the CNK 4 standard process which requires a large amount of replenishers, so that almost the same gamma value and the minimum density value can be obtained and in contrast with the above, the minimum density variation is too great and the γ stability is too poor to be put to practical use in the case of the emulsion containing no silver iodide. The results of Table 2 also show that, even if the emulsion is a silver iodobromide emulsion, it shows the same tendency as that of aforesaid emulsion containing no silver iodide, when the silver iodobromide emulsion is not of a core shell type and the content of iodine is low. As for a magenta coupler, it is understood that the couplers other than those of the invention are remarkably poor in the process stability. Incidentally, exemplified compounds for magenta coupler of the invention 7, 15, 22, 41, 100, 104 and 117 were examined and the same effect as that of Table 2 was obtained. Samples were prepared in the same manner as in the Sample 15 of Example 1 except that the magenta couplers were replaced by those described in Table 4 , and the resulted samples were evaluated in the same manner that was taken for Example 1 , except that the sodium bromide concentration in each of the color developing replenishers were changed to those shown in Table 3 . It is clearly understood in Table 3 that the process variation is great when magenta couplers other than those of the invention are used, even if the concentration of sodium bromide in the color developer and the replenishing amount are increased but the magenta couplers of the invention offer the remarkable effect despite the replenishment in a small amount and the concentration of sodium bromide as low as 3.0 x 10 ³ mol ℓ and below. Despite the use of magenta couplers of the invention, no effect on the process variation is observed at all when the replenishing amount other than that of the invention and the concentration of sodium bromide other than that of the invention are used. In order to evaluate an effect of the invention on secondary iron ion and thiosulfate, 0 ppm, 5 ppm and 10 ppm of secondary iron ion and 0 ppm, 20 ppm and 50 ppm of sodium thiosulfate were added respectively to each of the samples of Example 1 and then the process stability Δγ and the minimum density variation were examined, using 7 , 12 , 52 , 93 and 88 as a sequestering agent. As a result of the evaluation, the process variation and the minimum density variation both affected by secondary iron ion and sodium thiosulfate were small only when the emulsions and couplers of the invention were used, similarly to Example 1 and the use of aforesaid sequestering agent offered remarkable effects. Sample Nos. 41 through 43 were prepared respectively in the same manner as in Example 1 , except that the cyan couplers used in the Example 1 were replaced by the cyan couplers shown in Table 4 . The resulted samples were processed in the same manner as in Example 1 . The results thereof are shown in Table 4 . In the table, the data of the Examples 16 and 14 obtained in Example 1 are also shown for the comparison purpose. The characteristics of the cyan images thereof were obtained by measuring the red light transmission density with the same optical densitometer used in Example 1 . As is obvious from the results shown in Table 4 , the processing stability i.e., ΔD The exemplified cyan couplers, C 2, C 14, C 29, C 51, C 86, C 88, C 96 and C 101 were also tested. The results therefrom were almost the same as those shown in Table 3 . With respect to the Samples No. 31 and No. 33 both prepared in Example 2 , each of the gamma difference Δγ between that at the time of starting and that at the time of completing a continuous processing was measured in the same manner as in Example 2 , and the processing variations thereof were evaluated. The results thereof are shown in Table 5 . As is obvious from the above given Table 5 , it can be observed that the Sample No. 33 in which the couplers of the invention were used is relatively less in γ variation at the time of starting and completing a continuous processing and, in particular, it displays remarkable effects in the cases of a replenishing amount and a concentration of sodium bromide in the invention. The same effects can also be obtained when the Exemplified Compounds Nos. 7, 18, 59 and 104 each are used in place of the Exemplified compound 5 .
