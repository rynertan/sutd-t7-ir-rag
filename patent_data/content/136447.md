# Treatment of soil.

## Abstract
A process for treating soil which comprises applying to the soil an aqueous solution of a formaldehyde based pre condensate containing a condensation inititator in an amount sufficient for condensation to be completed within a predetermined period of time not exceeding 24 hours. Preferably a urea formaldehyde pre condensate is used. Advantageously the solution also contains a polysaccharide aliginic acid, alginate, low methoxyl pectin, gum karaya, gum arabic which is capable of forming a gel with divalent metal cations, particularly calcium, present in soil. The treated soil has improved erosion resistance.
