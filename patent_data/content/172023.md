# Hydraulically controlled infinitely variable traction roller transmission.

## Abstract
An infinitely variable traction roller transmission with traction rollers 26, 28 arranged between, and in engage ment with, opposite toric discs 20, 22 for the transmission of motion therebetween includes traction roller support trunnions 50 pivotally mounted in a transmission housing 10 which has partially cylindrical housing cavities formed behind the trunnions 50 , the trunnions 50 having a hydraulic support structure including a seal plate 56 having a curved face adjacent the partially cylindrical housing and an opposite flat face 60 adjacent said trunnions 50 so as to permit friction free sliding movement and pivoting of the trunnions 50 for adjustment of the transmission ratio.
