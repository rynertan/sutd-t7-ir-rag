# Conveyor with pocket gripping devices.

## Abstract
A conveyor apparatus for successively receiving single newspapers being advanced by a conveyor loading device and advancing the same to a downstream location for addi tional processing. The apparatus includes an andless con veyor track having a conveyor chain that supports a multi plicity of pocket members 52 in close proximity with the outer surface of the conveyor track and for movement about the extent of the track. The pocket members 52 are equally spaced about the chain and each includes a pair of spaced spring 72, 74 biased arcuated fingers 64, 66 that are continually urged in a direction to engage and maintain a newspaper 76 in a pocket when received from the loader. A cam controlled lever 80 is operatively connected to the arcuated fingers 64, 66 and serves to control movement of the latter between positions for receiving and releasing a newspaper from a pocket and a position for maintaining one within a pocket.
