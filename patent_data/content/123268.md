# ACOUSTO OPTIC DEFLECTOR SYSTEMS

## Abstract
An acousto optic deflector system including first and second transducers for producing acoustic waves for interac tion with an optic beam in an acousto optic device. The trans ducers are driven by signals of differing frequencies f₁ Δf, f₁ in order to produce two deflected optical beams from an incident optical beam launched from a laser. The two deflected beams are detected by a common photodetector whose output is filtered whereby to separate a component which is dependent on the frequency difference. The phase of this component is the relative optical phase of the two deflected optical beams. By determining the phase of the component for different frequencies f₁, f₁ fτ etc. , the optical angle of incidence ϑi may be obtained. Alternatively, by frequency modulating both transducer drive signals and appropriately electronically processing the detector output, a signal whose amplitude varies with the optical angle of inci dence can be obtained. This signal is a minimum when the optical angle of incidence is optimized. Optimization of the optical angle of incidence can be preformed automatically.
