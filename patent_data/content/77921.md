# SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE

## Abstract
An emitter region 15 of a first conductivity type n and base connecting region 16 of the first conductivity type constituting a base current path are formed in the base region 14 of a second conductivity type of a bipolar transistor. A collector connecting region 17 of the first conductivity type is formed in the collector region 12 of the bipolar transistor. Further, an emitter electrode 19 , base electrode 20 and collector electrode 21 respectively making an ohmic contact with the collector region, base connecting region and collector connecting region through the corresponding contact holes provided through an insula tion layer 18 .
