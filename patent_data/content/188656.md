# PENETRATING ROOFING MECHANICAL FASTENING AND SEALING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A penetrating mechanical roofing fastening and sealing system for securing a flexible sheet, provided with a plural ity of apertures, to the upper surface of a roof via the use of a plurality of spaced penetrating fastening and sealing devices, each of which includes upper and lower retainers, wherein the latter are anchored to the roofing surface and the elastomeric sheet is thereafter spread thereover, with cutting portions on the lower retainers being utilized to produce the sheet apertures, rigid upper retainers overlie and completely cover the apertures and the retainers are clamped together in a sealing relationship with the inter posed sheet portion. A method for securing and sealing a flexible sheet to the roofing substrate is also presented.
