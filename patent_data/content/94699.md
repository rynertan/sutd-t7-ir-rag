## Description
PROCESS FOR UPGRADING HYDROCARBON STREAMS COMPRISING CONJUGATED DIOLEFINS The present invention relates to a process for the upgrading of hydrocarbons or hydrocarbon streams comprising conjugated diolefins. Conjugated diolefins such as butadiene, isoprene and the piperylenes are valuable starting materials for various chemical processes, in particular polymerization processes. They are normally obtained by thermal or catalytic cracking processes using naphtha or gas oil as feedstock. The conjugated dienes are normally present in admixture with allenes, alkynes and the corresponding cyclo mono olefins and alkanes, or, when appropriate, as cis trans mixtures which also may contain allenes, alkynes and the corresponding cyclo mono olefins and alkanes. For polymerization purposes high quality grade conjugated dienes are required. The product mixtures obtained by the cracking process are therefore normally subjected to a further sophisticated treatment e.g., a distillation extraction process so as to warrant good quality products. It would constitute a considerable advantage when mixtures containing conjugated diolefins, also comprising mono olefins and alkanes, could be upgraded by a straightforward, low temperature treatment. It should be noted that the expression upgrading as used herein both refers to the partial or total removal of unwanted allenes and alkynes, thus improving the purity of the starting material, as well as to increasing the amount of the more readily polymerizable isomer, thus enlarging the concentration of the desired isomer in the starting material. Various methods have already been suggested in the art.It is possible, for instance, to subject the hydrocarbon stream comprising conjugated diolefins together with allenic and alky nic impurities e.g. C streams ex naphtha cracker to a hydrogenation treatment to remove such impurities. However, such hydrogenation treatment suffers from a low selectivity in the reduction of the allenes and alkynes since 1,3 diolefins are substantially reduced as well. A distillation treatment would still be required prior to the hydrogenation treatment in order to keep losses in conjugated diolefins within reasonable limits. The use of sodium to remove impurities has been widely reported in the literature. Much research has been devoted to the upgrading of, in particular, isoprene using sodium and a polymerization inhibitor, supported alkali amides or a sodium dispersion at a discrete higher temperature. It was found, however, that the use of sodium is insufficient with respect to the partial, let alone total removal of allenic impurities without causing unwanted losses of 1,3dienes, whereas alkynic impurities such as butyne 1 and vinylacetylene can be removed easily from 1,3 butadiene using a conventional sodium dispersion. Surprisingly, it has now been found that allenic impurities can be removed from conjugated dienes by treating such compounds with a dispersion of an alkali ne earth metal in the presence of an aliphatic amine having at least one primary amine group. It has further been found that the treatment as described hereinbefore results in an increase in the amount of the trans isomer of an appropriate conjugated diene which has at least two geometric isomeric forms, starting from all cis or from a cis trans mixture. The present invention therefore relates to a process for upgrading of hydrocarbon comprising conjugated diolefins using a dispersion of an alkali ne earth metal in the presence of an aliphatic amine having at least one primary amine group. One particular aspect of the present invention relates to a process wherein hydrocarbon streams comprising conjugated diolefins containing allenes and possibly acetylenic compounds are treated with a dispersion of an alkali ne earth metal in a hydrocarbon also containing an aliphatic amine having at least one primary amine group. Preferably, the present invention relates to a process wherein hydrocarbon streams containing one or more C4 Cg conjugated diolef ins, in particular butadiene, are treated with a dispersion of an alkali ne earth metal in a hydrocarbon also containing an aliphatic amine having at least one primary amine group. Another aspect of the present invention relates to a process wherein hydrocarbon streams containing isomerizable conjugated diolefins are treated with a dispersion of an alkali ne earth metal in a hydrocarbon also containing an aliphatic amine having at least one primary amine group. Preferably, the present invention relates to a process wherein cis and or cis trans piperylene s containing hydrocarbon streams are treated with a dispersion of an alkali ne earth metal in a hydrocarbon also containing an aliphatic amine having at least one primary amine group. It should be noted that allenic and or alkynic impurities present in the isomerizable conjugated diolefins are also removed during the isomerization process which renders the process according to the present invention very flexible. Conjugated diolefins which can be suitably upgraded according to the process according to the present invention comprise butadiene, isoprene, the piperylenes, 1,3 hexadiene and 1 vinylcyclohexene. The present process is of great interest for the upgrading of butadiene, in particular butadiene which has been obtained from the cracking of naphtha. The C4 stream thus obtained contains apart from butadiene also butenes and butane and is commonly referred to as the BBB stream. The main impurities normally present therein are vinylacetylene, butyne 1 and 1,2 butadiene. The level of impurities depends on the severity of the cracking operation and the possible working up procedure s applied thereafter.It has been found that rather large amounts of impurities, e.g. 1,2 butadiene in an amount of up to 3 Zw can be easily removed without affecting the amount of valuable compounds in the BBB stream. The main impurities in crude piperylene comprise pentyne l, cyclopentadiene and in particular 1,1 dimethylallene. As stated hereinbefore, the purification of crude piperylene according to the process according to the invention has the intrinsic advantage of the simultaneous isomerization of the cis isomer into the more valuable trans isomer whilst removing the allenic and alkynic impurities which would affect the polymerization catalyst to be applied. The upgrading according to the present invention is carried out in the presence of an amine according to the general formula R1 NH2 I wherein R1 represents an alkyl or aralkyl group or a group CR2R3 nNR4R5 wherein R2, R3 and R4, which may be the same or different, each represent a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group, n represents an integer up to 8 and R5 represents a hydrogen atom or a group CR2R3 nNR4R5 wherein R2, R3, R4, R5 and n are as defined hereinbefore or a group R6 oCR2R3 n wherein R6 represents an alkyl, aryl or aralkyl group andR2, R3 and n are as defined hereinbefore. The upgrading is preferably carried out in the presence of amines according to the general formula I wherein R1 represents an alkyl group of up to 16 carbon atoms or a group CR2R3 nNH2 whereinR2 and R3, which may be the same or different, each represent a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group and n represents an an integer of from 2 to 7, or a group CR2R3 nNR4R5 wherein R2 and R3, which may be the same or different, each represent a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group, R4 represents a hydrogen atom, n is an integer of from 2 to 7 and R5 represents a group CR2R3 nNR4H wherein R2, R3, R4 and n are as defined hereinbefore. Examples of compounds according to the general formula I include primary mono alkyl amines such as n butylamine, secbutylamine, n pentylamine, n hexylamine and cyclohexylamine.Examples of primary alkyl diamines include 1,2 diaminoethane, 1,2 diaminopropane, 1,3 diaminopropane, 1,2 diaminobutane, 1,4 diaminobutane, 1,5 diaminopentane, 1,6 diaminohexane and 1,4 diaminocyclohexane. Examples of polyamines containing at least one primary amine group include diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine and the 1,1 di alkyl die thylenetr iamines. Examples of oxygen containing primary amines include 2 ethoxy ethylamine and 3 ethoxy propylamine. Preference is given to the primary monoalkylamines nbutylamine and n hexylamine, the primary alkyl diamines 1,2diaminoethane, 1,2 diaminopropane and 1,3 diaminopropane and the polyamine diethylenetriamine.It is appreciated that the upgrading will benefit from a good compatibility of the various components in the reaction mixture. Mixtures of two or more compounds according to the general formula I can also be applied. The process according to the present invention is carried out using a dispersion of an alkali ne earth metal. Dispersions of alkali ne earth metals, in particular sodium dispel sions can easily be prepared by heating the solid alkali ne earth metal, in particular sodium in a suitable inert liquid until it has liquefied and subsequently mixing the two liquids vigorously, for example by stirring. If desired, a dispersant may be added to the mixture to accelerate the dispersion and to reduce the dimensions of the sodium particles. Examples of dispersants are fatty acids having a long carbon chain such as oleic acid. Higher alcohols and esters as well as some fine ly dispersed inert solids such as carbon can also be used.By cooling the mixture obtained down to temperatures below 98 C, the sodium forms solid particles which remain dispersed. The liquid which constitutes the homogeneous phase can be any liquid which is essentially inert to the alkali ne earth metal applied, the conjugated diolefin to be treated and the polymerization catalyst to be used in the polymerization process envisaged. Exemplary are hydrocarbons, hydrocarbon mixtures or hydrocarbon fractions having a boiling range at atmospheric pressure from 50 to 5000C, for example gasoline, kerosine, gas oil and lubricating oil distillates or aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and the xylenes. Minerals lubricating oil fractions are preferred since the alkali ne earth metals, in particular sodium readily remain dispersed therein.The dispersions may contain up to about 50 w of alkali ne earth metal, preferably an amount in the range of from 10 Zw to 30 Zw. The particle size of the finely dispersed alkali ne earth metal suspended in a liquid is not restricted to a sharply defined range. However, to facilitate shorter duration of the treatment and lower consumption of the alkali ne earth metal it is preferred to employ dispersions having alkali ne earth metal particles, in particular sodium particles, wherein half the number of sodium particles is smaller than 5 microns and most preferably smaller than 3 microns. The process according to the present invention is normally carried out using an alkali ne earth metal dispersion in an amount sufficient to remove the allenic and alkynic impurities present in the feed to be treated. Normally, dispersions of alkali ne earth . metals are used which contain up to 20 Mw, preferably between 0.5 w and 5 Mw of alkali ne earth metal, calculated on the total amount of hydrocarbon or hydrocarbon stream to be upgraded. The amount of amine according to the general formula I to be used is not critical and may vary between rather wide limits. It has been found that good results can be obtained using an alkali ne earth metal amine ratio in the range between 15 1 and 1 10. Preference is given to the use of an alkali ne earth metal primary amine ratio in the range of from 2 1 to 1 1 and an alkali ne earth metal bis primary amine molar ratio in the range of from 2 1 to 8 1. The conjugated diolefin to be upgraded, may be in the gaseous or in the liquid phase or may be a mixture of the two phases. Preferably, the conjugated diolefin should be mixed in the liquid phase with a liquid soluble in the conjugated diolefin and containing suspended alkali ne earth metal, resulting in better contacting with the metal and more rapid removal of the unwanted compounds. Good results can be obtained when the amine to be used is added in the appropriate amount to a conjugated diolefin already containing a dispersion of an alkali ne earth metal. It is, of course, also possible to prepare a dispersion of an alkali ne earth metal and an appropriate amine which mixture is than added to the conjugated diolefin to be upgraded. The process according to the present invention can be carried out conveniently at temperatures in the range of from 15 C to 100 C. The removal of allenic and possibly alkynic impurities is preferably carried out at room temperature or slightly above, whereas the isomerization of the cis isomers into the appropriate trans isomers is preferably carried out at temperatures in the range between 35 C and 600C. It has been found that even at the higher temperatures polymerization of the conjugated dienes does not occur under the prevailing upgrading conditions. It has been found that a very short contact time already allows for the removal of the allenic impurities which are notoriously difficult to remove compared with co present alkynic impurities. Contact times as short as 15 minutes or even less are sufficient to remove the allenic impurities below the level of detection 2 ppm . Prolonged contact times may be used but do not really contribute to the removal of impurities.Contact times much longer than one hour are not preferred because of the potential polymerization of the conjugated diolefines to be treated. The process according to the present invention can be performed batchwise, semi continuously or continuously. Preferably, the process according to the present invention is carried out continuously. Contacting of the conjugated dienes with the dispersion of an alkali ne earth metal also containing a compound according to the general formula I can be effected in one or more reactors, preferably provided with stirring equipment.When two or more reactors are applied, metallic and bound alkali ne earth metal can be separated from the conjugated diolefin stream discharged from the last reactor and recycled to the first reactor After treatment with the alkali ne earth metal, the stream thus treated contains metallic and bound alkali ne earth metal, the liquid in which the fresh alkali ne earth metal was dispersed and the conjugated diolefins enriched in the trans isomer when appropriate. From this mixture, the conjugated diene has to be separated which can be used for further reactions such as polymerization. Normally, metallic and bound alkali ne earth metals are separated first, e.g. by means of filtration, centrifugation or decantation. Subsequently, the conjugated diolefin can be purified, if desired, by means of distillation a conjugated diolefin fraction suitable for polymerization is obtained as the top product, while polymers, if any, and the liquid in which the fresh alkali ne earth metal was dispersed where this had a boiling range or boiling point higher than that of the conjugated liene are left in the residue. The present invention furter relates to a process for the polymerization of conjugated d enes, in particular 1,3 butadiene using as feedstock a hydrocarbon stream comprising conjugated diolef ins which have been upgraded by a process according to the present invention. The present invention relates in particular to a process for the polymerization of 1,3 butadiene, if desired in the presence of co polymerizable monomers, using a feedstock also containing butenes and butane which has been upgraded by a process according to the present invention as well as to polymers thus prepared. The polymerization can be carried out by methods known to those skilled in the art.For the polymerization, alkyl lithium compounds in which the alkyl group contains of from 2 to 8 carbon atoms are preferred, such as sec butyllithium, n butyllithium and n amyllithium. sec Butyllithium is particularly preferred because it initiates the polymerization especially rapidly. The invention will now be illustrated by means of the following Examples.Example 1 A C4 fraction was isolated by means of fractional distillation from a reaction product obtained by thermal cracking of a naphtha in the gas phase in the presence of steam. A typical GLC analysis of the crude BBB fraction indicated as major components 1,3 butadiene 45.6 w , butenes 49.1 and butanes 2.1 Zw . Butyne l was present in an amount of 1350 ppm, vinylacetylene in an amount of 4560 ppm and 1,2 butadiene in an amount of 2210 ppm. A typical sodium dispersion was prepared by vigorously stirring SHELL TALPA oil 30 SHELL TALPA is a RegisteredTrade Mark for a lubricating oil, the oil 30 applied here had a viscosity of 9.00E and 1.820E at 500 and 1000C, respectively with 10 w of metallic sodium at a temperature of 1800C. The experiments described hereinafter were carried out in a 1 litre autoclave wherein 150 g of the BBB fraction referred to hereinabove were mixed with the sodium dispersion referred to hereinabove in such amounts that 1 hw sodium contents on crude BBB fraction were obtained. Equimolar amounts with respect to sodium were added in the case of primary amines and halfmolar amounts when bis primary amines were applied by introducing them through a rubber seal at the top of the autoclave whilst stirring the mixture at 250C. During the experiments the gas phase in the reactor was submitted to GLC analysis samples were taken immediately after addition of the appropriate amines and at regular intervals. The BBB fraction was subjected to a treatment with the sodium dispersion as well as with the sodium dispersion also containing 1,2 propanediamine sodium amine ratio 1 2 at room temperature. The level of impurities remaining was determined by GLC analysis after 45 minutes for the fraction treated only with the sodium dispersion and after 15 minutes for the fraction treated with the sodium dispersion in the presence of 1,2 diaminopropane.

The molecular weight distributions of the obtained polybutadienes were compared with a reference sample prepared in cyclohexane by measurement of the respective GPC peakwidths at half height.The results are given in Table D. It will be clear from thisTable that when amines are used which are not in accordance with the general formula I aniline, di n propylamine broad molecular weight distributions are obtained, pointing to the presence of proton donating impurities such as 1,2 butadiene in the starting material.
