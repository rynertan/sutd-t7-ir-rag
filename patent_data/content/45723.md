## Description
Jaw for supporting overhead lines of trolley buses. . .. The present invention relates to a new type of jaw for supporting aerial contact lines of trolley buses, tramways, underground railways and so on, comprising two oblong plates fastened each other, which are equipped on the upper side with a connection to a suspension, cable and so on, and in the lower part with a structural shape for clamping the contact wire.As it is known, the critical point of the aerial contact lines lies in coincidence with the suspension, where the wire is fixed in order to support it. Indeed here cracks of the wire form owing to the stopping of the vibrations of the jaw, as well as loosening,for the wear is caused by the sliding friction of the collector shoes on the wire, both for the wire s clamping in the jaw after a span of free wire and for the direction change of the motion of the current collectors due to the cusp formed by the conductors at the intersection of the two catenary suspension lines, the preceding one and the following one.Along the curves the above mentioned effects are lessened in consequence o f the horizontal traction due to the traversing of the contact wi res, which are lengthwise stretched, and to the reduced length of the spans adjusted to the bending radius.However in the case of current collectors having lateral guide trolley buses , the traversing angle caused by the conductors is determinant for the lateral wea.r of the conductors themselves and the reliable slide of the current collectors. It is known that the damages due to the above mentioned causes can be kept within acceptable limits by means of the reduction of the traversing angles through the increase of the holding points, or, otherwise, by means of suitable radiusing electrical junction boxes neverthless these methods will increase weight and encumbrance.Moreover, on the one hand both methods can make the general problem less difficult, on the other hand they increase the above mentioned problems for the straight lines.The present invention offers an excellent solution, suggesting the use of jaws for straight and bent lines with limited weight and encumbrance. This aspect is clearly proved by the following figures a jaw according to this invention is 60 cm. long and weighs 1 kg, while an equivalent Jaw according to the previous technique is 160 cm long and weighs 6 7 kg.The jaw according to this invention is made in preference of stainless steel.According to the experience, the new jaw for straight lines allows the following advantages through a suitable lengthening of the section covered by the jaw itself a gradual damping of the vibrations is achieved and, moreover, an adjustable positioning of the stiffness point and the radiusing of the cusp are permitted.The stiffness of the jaw can be modified also by means of suitable notchings on the plates of the jaw itself. More over the new jaw for bent lines allows the radiusing 9f the traversing angles without weight increment and with reduced encumbrance.The new jaw, both for straight and bent lines comprises two plates lengthwise arranged side by side and fastened each other, whose lower ends are pliers shaped for the anchorage of the conductor having standard shaped cross section and whose top ends are equipped with a connection to the suspen sion.The new jaw for straight lines is equipped with a connection or hub for the suspension , which is central in regard to the length and to the axis of the jaw itself the connection can be formed by a nut or a threaded pin.On the contrary the new jaw for bent lines shows a connection hub which is central in regard to its length, but offcenter in regard to the jaw itself.The plates forming the jaw can show one bead, two beads or no bead, according to the type of jaw for 100 bent lines, 15O 15 bent lines or straight lines respectively the beads are obtained by a 900 external bending of the plates top edge.Moreover the combination of several plates allows the adaptation of the jaw to the lateral stresses and, consequently, to the traversing angles.The jaw according to this invention can be connected lengthwise by means of suitable plaques links , in order to obtain the expected length, or, otherwise,. in parallel for the support and the guide of two or more wires, forming a compact assembly for systems subject to high current drawing and installed within a limited room, e.g. for underground railways.The following figures will illustrate further the present invention without, however, limiting the same thereto Fig. 1 and 2 show part of a jaw for straight lines, object of the invention including the hub for the central suspension, in side view and in plan view respectively.Fig. 3 and 4 represent a jaw for bent lines, object of the invention, having an angle less than 100 or equal to 100, including the hub for the central and lateral suspension, in side view and plan view respectively.Fig. 5 represents a front view of the jaw for straight lines shown in fig. 1 and 2, including a female connector hub . Fig. 6 represents a front. view of the jaw for straight lines, shown in fig. 1 and 2 including a male connector hub .Fig. 7 and 8 represent two front views of two jaws for bent lines, object of the invention with an angle less than.100 or equal to 100 fig. 7 and with an angle less than 150 or equal to 150 fig. 8 .Fig. 9, 10 and 11 represent a connector hub of a jaw for bent lines, object of the invention, in side view, front view and plan view, respectively. As these figures show, the jaw object of the invention is formed by two plates 1 and 2 fastened each other, directly or indirectly, by means of bolts 15 or studs 10 passing through the holes 3. The plates 1 and 2, 6 and 7, 6 and 13 are pliers shaped at their lower ends in order to clamp the wire 11, while, in the case of a jaw for straight lines see fig. 5 and 6 , they are parallel at the top ends and equipped with a fork 5, having the form of an element 90 turned in the clockwise direction to which a nut 4 or a threaded pin 12 is welded for the connection to the suspension not represented in the figure. In the case of jaws for bent lines see fig. 7 and 8 , the top ends of one or both plates are L bent in order to stiffen themselves a hub 9 is connected to the mentioned jaws by means of the studs 10 and the hub itself is equipped with a threaded hole 14 for the connection to the suspension not represented in the figure.As already observed, the jaws according to this invention are made in preference of stainless steel, for example, AISI 316 we can specify in addition that the best results are obtained using plates manufactured from press forged stainless steel sheet.
