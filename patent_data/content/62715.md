# Improved fluid flow control valve.

## Abstract
A mixing valve for hot and cold domestic water has a control member 20, 22 and 23 movable within a body 12 whereby axial movement of the control member controls opening and closing of communication from hot and cold inlets 13 and 14 to an outlet 32, 2 and rotation of the control member controls the relative proportions of fluid flow from respective inlets to the outlet. A pressure chamber 90 is supplied with pressure fluid from the inlets for assisting closing action of the valve upon closure of a vent 28, 30 from the pressure chamber. In order to resist pressure surges at either inlet a restricted aperture 83 is provided to reduce flow from a reducing volume movement damping chamber towards the end of closing movement of the valve control member to prevent the final portion of the valve closing movement being too sudden.
