# Method and apparatus for monitoring automated testing of electronic circuits.

## Abstract
A plurality of signal applying and monitoring circuits are coupled to pins of an electronic device being testes to force test stimuli signals representing logic states or other parameters onto input pins of the device under test. The responses to the stimuli signals are monitored while the device is being tested. Each signal applying and monitoring circuit includes a node to be coupled to a pin of the device under test, a device power supply connected to the node for supplying a test bias signal, a comparison circuit connected to the node for indicating the relative magnitude of the test bias signal with respect to the bias level at the node, and a latch circuit responsive to the out put signal produced by the comparison circuit. The device power supply is included for providing test bias signals to test power drain during functional testing. The transitions of the de vice power supply are monitored and latched for providing a re cord of the power drain of the device being tested. Other fea tures are also disclosed.
