# Substituted 1H indoles, process for their preparation and duplicating and marking systems comprising them.

## Abstract
3 Substituted amino aryl or heteroaryl methyl 1H indoles which are useful as color formers in pressure sensitive carbonless duplicating systems and thermal marking systems are prepared by reacting 3 arylsulfonyl aryl or heteroaryl methyl 1H indoles with amines or precursors thereof in the presence of a base.
