# Apparatus and method for the lubrication of cans.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus are disclosed for applying a light coating of fluid to the outer surface of a circumferential strip of one end of a cylindrically shaped article. The article is stablized against angular axial movement while being advanced and rotated, in a planer path, through a treating zone. An airborne mist containing fine particles of the fluid is produced. This mist is transported to the treating zone and directed to impinge upon said circumferential strip. The impinged fluid mist is then leveled to achieve a uniform coat ing.
