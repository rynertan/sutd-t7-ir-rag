# Digitally responsive method and apparatus for positioning a transducer of a storage apparatus.

## Abstract
With a servo system for positioning a transducer of a rotatable storage apparatus over a servo tracks of a mag netic disk, a method for processing trains of positioning pulse signals is provided. With a fixed duration time, a reference voltage, changing with time, having a predeter mined pattern is generated and compared with a train of the positioning pulse signals contained in the duration time. The magnitude of the positioning signals which varies with the displacement of the transducer from a guide path to be followed is given by counting the number of the positioning signals exceeding the reference voltage pattern. Thus, an error signal for the servo system is fed back in a digital form. The method causes cost reduction of the apparatus because of its simplicity and flexibility for the users demand.
