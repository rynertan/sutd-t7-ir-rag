# Remote monitoring system.

## Abstract
A plurality of operating systems in buildings 12 organized in geographical groups, each group having a local service office 14 , are monitored at both the local offices 14 and a central office 16 for the presence of various combinatiions of performance criteria defining alarm condi tions. A master unit 18 in each building receives sensed signals from a plurality of slave units 20 and detects any change in the sensed signals. On detecting a change the master 18 checks sets of the signals to determine if any combinations thereof indicative of inoperative system condi tions are satisfied.
