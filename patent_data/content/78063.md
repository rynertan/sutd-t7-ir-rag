# A PROCESS FOR THE SEPARATION OF ESSENTIALLY PURE NITROGEN

## Abstract
A process is described in which gaseous nitrogen is recovered from air in a cryogenic air separation unit containing a single distillation column wherein the product nitrogen is compressed and a portion of the compressed nitrogen is recycled to the column to provide reboil in the bottom of said column and reflux at the top of said column. A waste crude oxygen stream is expanded to provide refrigera tion for the air separation unit.
