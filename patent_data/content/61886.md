# Initially erasable ink composition for a ball point writing instrument.

## Abstract
A method for making and the composition for an initially erasable ink for a ball point writing instrument which ink is characterized by its initial erasability by ordinary pencil erasers when applied by a ball point writing instrument to an absorbent paper like writing surface and which thereafter develops permanence. The method includes the steps of a selecting elastomeric material from the group consisting of natural rubbers, synthetic rubbers and mixtures thereof b masticating the selected elastomeric material by subjecting same to high shear stresses c coloring said masticated elastomeric material by forced impregnation of colored pigments into said elastomeric material while subjecting same to further shear stresses and d mixing the pigmented elastomeric material with a solvent system that includes a volatile component and an essentially non volatile low viscosity component in the form of a hydrocarbon oil, an essential oil, a petroleum derivative, a plasticizer or mixtures thereof to form an erasable ink composition. The ink composition comprises a pre pigmented elastomer and a solvent system that contains a volatile component and an essentially non volatile low viscosity component.
