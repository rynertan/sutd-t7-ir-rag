# Aluminium and cobalt coated thermal spray powder.

## Abstract
A thermal spray composite is disclosed, comprised of a base constituent formed from at least one of the base metals nickel, iron and cobalt, and at least one of the modifying elements chromium and aluminum, plus individual consti tuents aluminum, cobalt and, optionally, molybdenum. In a preferred form, the composite is a powder having an alloy core of the base metal and the modifying element, the core having fine particles of the individual elements secured thereto with a binder. The process of thermal spraying the composite is also disclosed, and the resulting coating have a high degree of high temperature corrosion resistance and tenacity compared to prior art thermal sprayed coatings.
