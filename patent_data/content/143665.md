# SCRAPER RINGS

## Abstract
A scraper ring system for removing fluid from a relatively moving cylindrical surface such as a piston rod 10 which comprises a series of overlapping blades or leaves 12 which are pressed against the rod surface at an acute angle either by a garter spring 15 or when the blades 12 are part of a continuous strip, by the natural resilience of the strip and blades. The blades 12 are located in a housing 11 and passages 20 are provided for the discharge of any removed fluid.
