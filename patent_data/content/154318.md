The invention, further developments and advantages of the invention as well as further aspects of the problem to be solved by the invention will be elucidated by means of the following description of the exemplary embodiments of the invention. Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of the present invention. Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram of an embodiment employing a transistor array. Fig. 3 is a transistor array.For the sake of shortness of the description, explicite reference to the drawings is made here as regards the particular arrangements of the components of the circuit diagrams in Fig. 1 to 3 and their particular interconnection. Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an embodiment of the present invention, indicating a high frequency modulation circuit which is changing over to the PAL system and theSECAM system. In this figure, A to L denote blocks,COSC is a carrier oscillator, Q1 to Q8 are transistors, C1 to C20 are capacitors, L1 to L7 are coils, D1 to D4 are diodes, R1 to R28 are resistors, VR1 to VR2 are variable resistors, DA1 is a diode array, B is a power supply voltage, for example, of 9V, SW is a change over terminal which supplies the switching signal, AUD is an input terminal of a voice signal, VID is an input terminal of a video signal,RFOUT is an output terminal. The block A is integrated as a circuit containing a regulated power supply circuit VG, a video signal clamp and white clip circuit CC, a voice sub carrier generator and a frequency modulation circuit OM. 1 to 9 indicate terminals. The block B forms a tank circuit connected to the terminals 1 and 2 of block A. This tank circuit is composed of coils L2 and L3, capacitors C4 to C6 and a diode D1.The connection of coil L3 is controlled by the diode Dl. The regulated power supply circuit VG outputs, for example, a voltage of 5.3V to the terminal 8. The block C is composed of a transistor Q1 which turns ON and OFF in accordance with a switching signal applied to the switching terminal SW. When it is ON, a forward current flows through a diode D1 and therefore coil L3 is connected in parallel to coil L2 through the capacitors C5 and C6. When it is OFF, reverse bias is applied to the diode D1 and thereby the coil L3 is separated. The block D forms a preemphasis circuit and comprises a resistor R5 and a capacitor C2. The blocks E and F form buffer amplifiers and switching circuits for the voice signal and comprise transistors Q4 to B7. The block G forms an amplitude modulator and comprises a transistor Q2. The block H forms a high pass filter and comprises a coil L5 and a capacitor C12. The block I forms a low pass filter and comprises coils L6 to L7, capacitors C13 to C14, C18 toC20. The block J forms a switch circuit and comprises a transistor Q8. The block K forms a bias switching circuit and comprises a transistor Q3, a diode array DAl and variable resistors VR1 to VR2, etc. A voltage to be applied to the diode array DAl by the variable resistor VRl when the transistor Q8 is ON is set higher than a voltage to be applied to the diode array DAl by the variable resistor VR2, and this voltage is applied to the base of transistor Q3 through the diode array DAl. For example, a voltage to be applied to the base of transistor Q3 through the diode array DAl when the transistor Q8 is ON is set to 2.586V, while a voltage to be applied to the base of transistor Q3 through the diode array DAl when the transistor Q8 is OFF is set to l.592V.The block L forms a picture signal modulation and mixer and comprises diodes D3 to D4, a capacitor Cl 6 and a transformer Tl. This block L performs negative modulation by a bias sent from the block K when the transistor Q8 is ON and also performs positive modulation by a bias sent from the block K when the transistorQ8 is OFF. If a low level signal is applied to the switching terminal SW, the modulation circuit is switched to the modulation of the PAL system. If a high level signal is applied to the switching terminal SW, the modulation circuit is switched to the modulation of the SECAM system. If the switching terminal SW is set to a low level, the transistor Ql of block C and the transistor Q4 of block E become OFF, while the transistor Q7 of block F and the transistor Q8 of block J become ON. As a result, in the block K, the emitter voltage of transistor Q3 is determined by a voltage applied to the diode array DAl through the variable resistor VRl.Since this emitter voltage is supplied to the center point of transformer Tl of block L, the block L operates as a modulator of the PAL system, namely as the video signal modulator of a negative modu lation system. When the transistor Q7 of block F turns ON, the emitter voltage of transistor Q6 rises up to a value near the collector voltage, the base and the emitter are reversely biased and the block F becomes non operative. Meanwhile, since the transistor Q4 of block E is OFF, the transistor Q5 operates as an emitter follower amplifier. The voice signal input to the input terminal AUD is applied to the voice sub carrier generator and frequency modulation circuit OM of the block A from the terminal 3 of block E through the block D forming the preemphasis circuit. A video signal input to the input terminal VID is applied to the terminal 7 of block A through a resistor Ril and a capacitor C9. This signal is further applied to the block L from the terminal 6 through the resistorR25 after it have been processed by the video signal clamp and white clip circuit CC. In the block B, the potential at the connecting point of resistors RB and R9 is set higher than a voltage at the terminal 8 of block A and therefore the diode Dl becomes OFF due to a reverse bias applied thereto.Accordingly, coil L2 and capacitor C4 form a tank circuit and a resonant frequency of this tank circuit is, for example, 5.5 MHz. A voice sub carrier signal which is frequencymodulated by a voice signal is output to the terminal 4 from the voice sub carrier generator and frequency modulation circuit OM of the block A and is then applied to the block G forming an amplitude modulator through the capacitors Cl0, Cull. However, since the block F is in the non rative condition, the transistorQ6 does not output a voice signal and a frequency modulated voice sub carrier signal is output to the block H forming a high pass filter from the collector of transistor Q2 of block G. This block H prevents generation of sound fringe due to a leak of voice signal to the video modulator and mixer. An output signal of this block H is applied to the block I form ing a low pass filter and is then applied to the blockL through a resistor R24. Therefore, an output signal of the video signal clamp and white clip circuit CC and an output signal of the block I forming the low pass filter are applied to the block L and a carrier signal in the UHF band sent from the carrier generator COSC is also applied thereto.Thereby, a signal modulated in accordance with the PAL system is output to the output terminal RFOUT. When the switching terminal SW is set tp a high level, the transistor Ql of block C becomes ON, the transistor Q4 of block E becomes ON, the transistor O7 of block F becomes OFF and the transistor Q8 of block J becomes OFF. When the transistor Ql becomes ON, the potential at the connecting point of resistors R8 and R9 becomes almost zero and a forward voltage is applied to the diode Dl which becomes ON, causing the coil L3 to be connected in parallel to the coil L2. Thereby, the resonant frequency of tank circuit of block B becomes, for example, 6.5 MHz. A voice signal applied to the input terminal AUD is applied to the block G through resistor R14 and capacitor Cll from the transistor Q6 of block F since the block E becomes non operative and the block F operates. Moreover, since the voice sub carrier signal is applied to the block G through the capacitor C10 from the terminal 4 of block A, the voice sub carrier signal is mpljtude modulated by a voice signal in the block G. Since the block E is non operative, a voice signal is not applied to the terminal 3 of block A and the voice sub carrier wave sent from the terminal 4 is not frequency modulated. As in the case of above,the output signal of blockG is applied to the block L through the blocks H and I and is mixed with a video signal applied to the block L through the resistor R25 from the terminal 6 of block A. Such a. mixed signal modulates the carrier in the UHF band sent from the carrier oscillator COSC and outputs a modulated signal from the output terminal RFOUT. Since the transistor Q8 of block J is OFF, the voltage set by the variable resistor VR2 is applied to the base of transistor Q3 through the diode array DAl in the block K and the emitter voltage of transistor Q3 is determined by the variable resistor VR2 and the block L operates in the SECAM system, namely as a video modulator of positive modulation. Fig. 2 shows an embodiment where the transistorsQ4 to08 of the embodiment of the present inveniton shown in Fig. 1 are arranged as a transistor arrayTAl. The same symbols as those in Fig. 1 indicate the same components. F1 is the low 9 ss filter of block I. A indicates the block A and the transistor array TAl has the structure indicated in Fig. 3. Namely, a terminal 1 and a terminal 7 are connected to the common collector, the terminals 2 to 6are connected to the emitters of transistors 04 to Q8 the terminals 12 to 8. are connected to the bases of transistors Q4 to 08. With such a transistor array TAl, the structure for switching the modulation system corresponding to different television systems can be formed small in size. In the embodiment described above, since emitter follower circuit are formed in the blocks E and F, an input impedance for the voice signal can be set high and such an input impedance has a high frequency characteristic. When any one of transistors Q4 and Q7 which perform switching operations is ON, the emitter voltage of the associated one of transistors Q5 and Q6 rises up to a value nearer to the collector voltage and a reverse bias of l.8V is applied across the base and emitter, whereby accurate switching can be ensured. If one sets inoperative any of transistors Q5 and Q6 only by setting the operating current thereof to zero, the following problem would arise.When an input signal of 1,2 Vpp or more, for example, is applied to the base of the transistor which has been set inoperative, the base emitter junction of that transistor becomes conductive, leading to an amplitude modulated component being mixed into the frequency modulated voice sub carrier if the transistor Q6 is set inoperative, and leading to a frequency modulated component being mixed into the amplitude modulated voice sub carrier if transistor Q5 is set inoperative. On the other hand, in the block G, since a modulator is composed of a transistor Q2, the input impedance becomes high as compared with that of a modulator consisting of a diode and thereby a lesser power is required for supplying the voice sub carrier wave and the voice signal. Moreover, less amount of carrier leaks to the voice signal, while less amount of voice signal leaks to the carrier wave signal source. The block H forms a high pass filter having a capacitor Cl2 and a coil L5. Such a high pass filter is generally a T shaped filter with the one end of the coil being grounded for rejection of a DC component. In the above embodiment, a L shaped filter is formed by connecting the one end of coil L5 to the power source and thereby one capacitor can be eliminated from the T shaped filter. The one end of coil L5 is equivalently grounded through an internal impedance of power supply and capacitor C15. The block K is capable of switching the setting of bias of block L and easily switching such bias with the transistor Q8.The present invention can easily be adopted for switching of the other television systems through the common part, as well as the PAL and SECAM systems described above.
