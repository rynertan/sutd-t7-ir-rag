# A sheet hinge forming apparatus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for forming a hinge in successive sheets 20 to permit the sheets to lay substantially flat after being opened when bound to one another in a booklet. The stiffness of successive advancing sheets in a marginal region 44 along a line 40, 42 substantially parallel to an edge of the sheet is reduced to facilitate bending of the sheet. The line of reduced stiffness for successive sheets is offset from one another so as to enable bending of the sheets therealong permitting the open sheets of a booklet of sheets to lay substantially flat.
