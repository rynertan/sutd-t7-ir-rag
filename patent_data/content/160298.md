# IMPROVED ROTATIONAL MOLDING METHOD

## Abstract
An improved rotational molding method for making a laminated plastic structure of the type in which successive charges of particulate plastics are released in a mold cavity rotating in an oven to coalesce successively along the mold cavity wall after which the mold is removed from the oven for cooling. By removing the rotating mold from the oven prior to completion of the formation of the inside layer, cooling of the outside of the mold will be concurrent with coalescence of the inside layer. This shortens the time of the molding cycle and reduces warping problems.
