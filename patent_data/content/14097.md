# Wheel rim and obstructor band therefor.

## Abstract
A wheel rim has a safety band for preventing access of a tyre bead to the well of the rim. The band is usable either for a tubed or a tubeless tyre rim. It consists of two cylindrical band parts 1 and a link part 2 articulating them together. The link part 2 has a depressed area allowing access of a valve of an inner tube to a valve aperture in the well. The band parts 1 are tensioned together at their other ends by a screw 10 jour nalled in a pivotable rod 9 and engaging in a pivotable nut 8 , the nut and rod being journalled in webs 7 of the parts 1 . The link part has inwardly directed claws 17 to engage with windows in the cylindrical portion of band parts 1 . The link part 2 is formed from stock of constant cross section such as an extrusion by transverse cuts, and the band parts 1 may also be extrusions.

## Description
WHEEL RIM AND OBSTRUCTOR BAND THEREFOR This invention relates to wheel rims and is concerned with the prevention of the consequences which might arise from loss of air pressure when a vehicle with a pneumatic tyre is travelling at speed. This loss might otherwise cause the tyre to fall from the rim which in turn causes disastrous loss of steering control. There have been previous proposals in the 1920 s and 1930 s for safety obstructors for wells of vehicles rims which were directed to problems which arose specifically when a tyre had an innertube. These solutions, examples of which are seen in U.K. patents No.222768 and 241120 were however quite impractical for the tubeless tyres which became commercially available from the late 1940 s.In order to deal with the safety problems for which tubeless tyres give rise prior proposals have been seen for examle in United Kingdom Patent No.1420622 and 1488871 where the difficulties arising from the necessity for preventing the formation of any leak paths through the rim were solved at the same time as the provision of an obstructor for the well which was independent of the state of inflation at the time or even of the presence of a tyre on the rim, was strong and was well adapted to resist the high speeds which were and are current.However neither of these prior proposals was intended for use with tubed tyres because it could not realistically be assembled to allow a normal valve of a tubed tyre to project through the well so as to pass to the inner periphery of the rim where it would have to be accessible for inflation. In practical terms they are restricted to use with and in rims for tubeless tyres. In prior dated but as yet unpublished U.K.applications 39369 76 and 44482 78 we have provided a wheel rim which is equipped with a well obstructor which is in principle usable either for a tubed or a tubeless tyre. A common feature of these two proposals is that a portion of the band like element itself is cranked to provide a comparatively short inset portion offering access to the valve aperture in the well and which lay on or close to the base of the well. This cranking was performed on the material of the band itself i.e. on the material which extended in cylindrical fashion around the well. In the present invention we further improve upon these two latter proposals by providing that an inset portion in a composite obstructor element having at least two cylindrical extending band parts is provided by a separate link part of the band. This most suitably will be produced by a process such as rolling or extrusion so that it is originally of indefinite length and constant cross section. The lateral direction of its length will be its longitudinal circumferential direction when positioned as part of the obstructor, the part being defined by transverse cuts of the stock of indefinite length.As a result of this the cylindrically extending band parts may be made simply and without need for the cranking operation upon them, and exact symmetricality in the obstructor as a whole may be assured and a single section may, by virtue of being cut to different lengths and at different angles be adapted for use in wells of any one of a plurality of well widths or well sidewall angles. The section is preferably symmetrical about its original longitudinal centre line so that when cut transversely it is immaterial in which circumferential direction it is inserted in the well, the section preferably having at each of its edges of its length at each of its cicumferential ends when cut for use in the band a claw element for engagement through a window aperture in an outer face of the cylindrically extending band parts.In this case by a simple hooking action the at least three parts of the band may be interengaged together for fitting in the well of the rim. The cylindrically extending band parts may be also of constant cross section having, for example, one or more circumferentially extending and radially inwardly directed ribs to form a platform for supporting the cylindrical portion of the cylindrically extending parts of the band at the appropriate distance above the base of the well so that it is in or adjacent to the mouth of the well. Alternatively, lugs either longitudinal or transverse may be provided in the manner which is disclosed in the said U.K. Patent 1488871, to assure at least lateral positioning of the obstructor. The invention relates to an assembled rim with the obstructor and possibly a tyre to the assembled obstructor itself and to the cylindrically extending and link parts thereof. A particular embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings wherein Fig. 1 shows an assembled obstructor band having two cylindrically extending parts and one link member, Fig. 2 is a plan view on the arrow II Fig. 1, and includes a section on the line II II of Fig. 1 showing the positioning of the obstructor in a wheel rim, Fig.3 shows in more detail a side view of the link member, Fig.4 shows a cross section analogous to that on the line II II of Fig.l but of a rim and of an obstructor having a different cross section, and Fig.5 is a view on the arrow V, Fig.l. The obstructor as seen in Fig.l has three main parts. These are two cylindrically extending parts 1 and a link part 2 which joins them. At one pair of adjacent ends the cylindrically extending parts 1 are joined by retaining means 3 which will be described in more detail later. Each of the parts is inextensible as are also the retaining means. In this embodiment each of the cylindrically extending parts 1 has a cylindrical portion 4 of which a radially outer surface is to lie substantially flush with or to bridge over the mouth of a well 5 of a wheel rim 6 see the sectional part of Fig.2 , and has circumferentially extending radially inwardly directed web or webs 7 which are to act as a support platform by bearing on the base 8 of the well of the rim. The disposition of the cylindrical portion 4 in relation to these webs 7 can be varied in accordance with the type of rim in which it is proposed to use the obstructor. As seen in Fig.4 some rims 6 have wider and more eccentric wells 5 than that seen in Fig.2 and the band part 4 will accordingly be formed to extend further to one side of the webs 7. At one pair of adjacent ends the portions 1 are joined by retaining. means 3 which have the function of inextensible and positively holding the band parts in position in the rim unless and until released by a conscious act. A desirable arrangement of such retaining means is shown here, deriving from the use of webs 7 as journals for a cylindrical nut 8 and cylindrical rod 9.A screw 10 penetrates the rod 9 through a diametrical bore therein and its stem is freely rotatable and axially slidable in it. A corresponding diametrical bore through cylindrical nut 8 is however screwthreaded and is engaged by the screwthreaded part of the stem of the screw 10 so that appropriate rotation of the screw by for example a screwdriver acting on its head I1 through a slot 12 in one of the portions 1 can draw the cylindrical nut 8 and the cylindrical rod 9 together thereby drawing the adjacent ends of the parts 1 together. No torsional strain will be exerted on those parts as a result of this action since each of the cylindrical elements 8 and 9 is free to rotate in the circular holes which journal it within the respective webs 7. The other pair of adjacent ends of the cylindrical extending parts are held together by a link part 2. This has when seen in end view the conformation of a shallow divergent sided channel with outwardly extending lips, the whole being arcuate so as to conform with the radius of curvature of the rim in which the obstructor is to be fitted. The outwardly extending lips 15 Fig.2 are the same width as the cylindrical portion 4 but the radially innermost part of the link part, which is the base of its channel, is the width of the base 8 of the well 5 into which the element is to fit. This portion 16 can again be best seen from Fig.2. Each of the outwardly extending lips has below it a backwardly turned claw 17. Beyond this and on the outer face of the lips 15 there is a tapered off portion 18 which is to merge substantially smoothly with the outer surface of the cylindrical portions 4 of the respective parts 1. Inclined side walls 19 of the channel of the link portion 2, are cut at an angle the same or different such that their edges will conform to the respective inclinations of the side walls of the well 5 into which they are to fit. It can be seen that the assembly of the obstructor together is simply a matter of hooking the claws 17 through corresponding apertures 20 in the cylindrical portions 4 of the cylindrically extending parts 1 and drawing the parts 1 away until the undercut portions of the claws are engaged and latched under the ends of the portions 4 the width of the claws 17 and the aperture 20 is equal to the distance between the ribs 7 . The parts 1 can now no longer be drawn further apart. The tyre on the rim now having been pushed to one side of the well the band is fitted in the well as described for example in U.K. Patent 1420622 before engagement and tightening of the retaining means 3. The link portion 2 is positioned adjacent the aperture in the side wall of the well which is for the reception of the valve of a tubed tyre.It may be necessary to attach to that valve before fitting a string or other element which is led through the valve aperture before the fitting of the obstructor.After the fitting of the obstructor the valve is drawn through the aperture and the tyre is ready for inflation. It is most convenient to make the link member 2 as an extrudate of an aluminium alloy or other suitable material. This extrudate is of constant cross section as seen in Fig.l Fig.3 or Fig.4 and is formed to size for a given well by being cut transversely to the longitudinal direction of the extrudate, the width of the extrudate then becoming the circumferential length of the link portion. If the angle of this cut or cuts i.e. the angle of the cut relative to the vertical if the lateral and longitudinal directions are horizontal is or are appropriately selected the inclined edges 19 of the inclined side walls may be formed by this cutting operation. Furthermore, the cylindrically extending parts 1 are also of uniform cross section and may themselves be extrudates of an aluminium alloy or other suitable material.
