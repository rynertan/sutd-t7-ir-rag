# A REMOTE CONTROL AND MONITORING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A remote control and monitoring system has a master control unit and a plurality of slave units 1 . Each slave unit 1 has a control circuit 2 for receiving signals from and trans mitting signals to the master unit and a plurality of control and sensor units 3 . Each control and sensor unit 3 comprises a transistor TR2 connected in series with a component to be controlled or whose condition is to be sensed and is con nected to the control circuit 2 for receiving drive signals therefrom. Each control and sensor unit 2 also includes a comparator A2 connected to sense the current through the transistor TR2 . The control circuit 2 is connected to the comparator A2 and is arranged to produce a fault signal when current exceeding a predetermined value continues to flow through the transistor TR2 for more than a predeter mined period after the beginning of a drive signal thereto.
