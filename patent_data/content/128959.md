# NUMERICAL CONTROL APPARATUS.

## Abstract
The reliability of numerical control apparatus is improved by making it possible to detect any abnormality in a position detection pulse delivered every time a movable part moves a predetermined distance. A position detector 6 outputs a reference position detection pulse every time a movable part reached a predtermined position, and a direction discrimina tion circuit 7 outputs a position detection pulse every time the movable part moves a predetermined distance. A revers ible counter 8 counts the number of position detection pulses output from the direction discrimination circuit 7 , and abnormality detection circuits 9 , 10 detect any abnormality in the position detection pulses on the basis of the contents of the reversible counter 8 and the timing of the generation of the reference position detection pulses. Accordingly, it is possible to detect any abnormality in the position detection pulses which may result in malfunction such as runaway of a motor, deviation of an actual position from a command posi tion, etc. Accordingly, the reliability of the numerical control apparatus can be improved.
