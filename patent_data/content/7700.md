# Large scale integrated circuit generator chip for an electronic organ and method of generating frequencies in an electronic organ.

## Abstract
In an electronic organ or the like constructed of a plurality of large scale integrated circuit LSI chips, the present dis closure relates to a generator chip. The chip is opera tive over one octave of notes, and a string of chips Fig. 4 134, 136, 138, 140, 142, 144 is cascaded to provide as many octaves as there are in the instrument.
