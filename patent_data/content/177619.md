## Description
This invention relates to a cut contour display method in a wire electric discharge machine. In numerical control machining inclusive of wire electrical discharge machining, the common practice is to display the machining path decided by the NC program on a display unit such as a cathode ray tube CRT before actual machining takes place, check the program based on the display and then start the numerically controlled machining operation. In wire electric discharge machining wherein a wire electrode path on either the upper or lower surface of the workpiece is commanded as the programmed path, the practice in the prior art is to display only the wire electrode path lying on the upper or lower workpiece surface, which constitutes the programmed surface, when the program check is performed. In a case where taper cutting is carried out by a wire electric discharge machine, however, the contour cut on the upper surface of the workpiece and the contour cut on the lower surface of the workpiece differ. As a result, the taper cut contour cannot be fully comprehended merely by displaying solely the contour of one surface, namely the upper or lower surface of the workpiece. This constitutes a hindrance to the program checking operation. JP A 54 124398 discloses a method of displaying a cut contour in a wire electric discharge machine, but only a single contour can be displayed, and it is necessary for the machine to travel along its cutting path. The object of the present invention is to provide a cut contour display method in a wire electric discharge machine, wherein cut contours on the upper and lower surfaces of a workpiece, namely the wire electrode paths on the upper and lower surfaces of the workpiece, can be displayed on a display unit together with a plurality of cross sectional contours obtained when a taper cut surface is cut by a plurality of planes lying parallel to the lower surface of the workpiece. The present invention provides a cut contour display method in a wire electrical discharge machine for subjecting a workpiece to taper cutting by moving a workpiece, relative to a wire electrode, on a plane which is parallel to a horizontal surface and moving a wire tensioning guide on another plane which is parallel to said horizontal surface. The method includes a step of entering a programmed path lying on the upper or lower surface of the workpiece, the thickness of the workpiece, a taper angle in each data block defining the programmed path or a vector indicative of an offset between the upper and lower surfaces of the workpiece at the end of the block, and data specifying a number of cross sectional contours obtained by cutting a taper cut surface into a plurality of planes lying parallel to the lower surface of the workpiece, a step of calculating a wire electrode path on whichever one of the upper and lower surfaces of the workpiece is not a programmed surface by using the programmed path, workpiece thickness, taper angle or vector indicative of the offset between the upper and lower surfaces of the workpiece at the end of the block, a step of calculating coordinate values of points on each cross sectional contour at an end portion of each block by using the wire electrode paths on the upper and lower surfaces of the workpiece and the number of cross sectional contours, and a step of displaying, on a display unit, the wire electrode paths on the upper and lower surfaces of the workpiece as well as each cross sectional contour by using wire electrode path data for upper and lower surfaces of the workpiece and the coordinate values of the points on each cross sectional contour at the end portion of each block. According to the present invention, the taper cut contour can be comprehended with facility from a graphic displayed on the display unit.

As is well known in the art, a wire electrical discharge machine has a wire electrode stretched between an upper guide and a lower guide and machines a workpiece by producing an electrical discharge between the wire electrode and the workpiece. The workpiece, secured to a table, is transported in X and Y directions along a cutting contour in response to commands from a numerical control apparatus. When the wire electrode is tensioned normal to the table workpiece , the upper and lower surfaces of the workpiece will be machined into contours which are identical. If the arrangement is such that the upper guide can be displaced in the X and Y directions referred to as the U and V axes to incline the wire electrode with respect to the workpiece as by displacing the upper guide in a direction at right angles to the direction of workpiece movement, then the upper and lower surfaces of the workpiece will not be cut to the same contour, and the surface cut by the wire electrode will be inclined. This is so called taper cutting. Fig. 1 is a schematic view for explaining such taper cutting, in which a wire electrode WR is stretched between an upper guide UG and a lower gide DG at a predetermined angle of inclination with respect to a workpiece WK. If we take the lower surface PL of the workpiece WK as the programmed contour the upper surface QU of the workpiece WK may also serve as the programmed contour , and if we let α denote the taper angle, J the distance from the upper guide UG to the lower surface of the workpiece, and S the distance from the lower guide DG to the lower surface of the workpiece WK, then the offset d₁ of the lower guide DG and the offset d₂ of the upper guide UG with respect to the lower surface PL of the workpiece, may be expressed as follows Note that d is the cut width. Accordingly, if, by way of example, the movement of the upper guide UG tensioning the wire electrode WR is so controlled in relation to workpiece movement that the offsets d₁, d₂ remain constant, then wire electric discharge machining can be carried out at a constant taper angle, as shown in Fig. 2. The dashed line and one dot chain line in Fig. 2 indicate the paths of the upper and lower guides UG, DG, respectively. In performing taper cutting with such a wire electric discharge machine, a programmed path on the upper or lower surface of the workpiece, workpiece thickness T, the taper angle α in each block or a vector indicative of the positional offset between the upper and lower surfaces of the workpiece at each block end, and distances J, S are commanded and cutting is carried out in the manner commanded based on these data. Figs. 3, 4 and 5 are schematic views for describing a cut contour display method according to the present invention. In Fig. 3, points A, B, C, D... are points on the cut contour of the lower workpiece surface on the wire electrode path lying on the lower surface of the workpiece . Straight lines and circular arcs connecting these points are commanded as a programmed path WDP. Commanded together with the programmed path are taper angles α The wire electrode path on the lower surface of the workpiece coincides with the programmed path WDP. Accordingly, the wire electrode path on the lower surface of the workpiece can be displayed on a display unit with ease by using the commanded NC program data. Meanwhile, the wire electrode path WUP on the upper surface of the workpiece is obtained in a manner which will now be set forth. We shall assume that the coordinate values of A in Fig. 3 are known. At the end of the first block b₁, the coordinate values of the wire electrode at point B on the upper surface of the workpiece are obtained as the point of intersection between a straight line L₁, which is offset by T tanα₁ from a commanded straight line AB on the lower surface of the workpiece in the first block b₁, and a straight line L₂, which is offset by T tanα₂ from a commanded straight line BC on the lower surface of the workpiece in the second block b₂. At the end of the second block b₂, the coordinate values of the wire electrode at point C on the upper surface of the workpiece are obtained as the point of intersection between the straight line L₂, which is offset by T tanα₂ from the commanded straight line BC on the lower surface of the workpiece in the first block b₂, and a circular arc ARC, which is offset by T tanα₃ from a commanded circular arc CD on the lower surface of the workpiece in the third block b₃. Thereafter, and in similar fashion, the wire electrode positions on the upper surface of the workpiece at the end of the respective blocks are found successively by using the commanded paths in the present block b When the wire electrode position on the upper and lower surfaces of the workpiece at the beginning and end of each block have been calculated through the foregoing processing, these wire electrode position data and the number n of cross sectional contours obtained by cutting the taper cut surface by planes parallel to the lower surface of the workpiece are used to obtain the coordinate values of points at the end portion of each block of a respective one of the cross sectional contours. Fig. 6 is a block diagram of an NC apparatus for practicing the cut contour display method of the present invention, and Fig. 7 is a flowchart of processing according to the present invention. In Fig. 6, numeral 1 denotes a processor, 2 a ROM storing a control program, 3 a RAM for storing various data, 4 an NC data reader for reading NC data from an NC tape, not shown, 5 a graphic display unit, 6 an operator s panel, 7 a pulse distributor, 8 an interface circuit, and 9 a wire electric discharge machine. The present invention will now be described in accordance with the flowchart shown in Fig. 7. In the case described above, the image is displayed on the CRT 5e with the wire electrodes paths on the upper and lower surfaces of the workpiece and the cross sectional contours of the tapered surface projected onto the XY plane. However, control can be so executed as to display these in the form of a perspective view. A case in which a perspective view is displayed will now be described. Fig. 9 is a view for describing a case where a perspective view is displayed. In the Figure, DPS represents the CRT display screen CRT screen , BRP denotes the origin of the graphic coordinate system X Y coordinate system of the CRT screen, the coordinates of the origin being 0,0 , DRP designates the origin of three dimensional coordinate axes x y z of a perspective view displayed on the CRT screen, the coordinates of the origin being X Accordingly, if the three dimensional coordinate values x,y,z , the angles ϑ, β and the coordinate values X Let the Z axis coordinate value of the lower surface of the workpiece be 0. In such case the three dimensional coordinate values of the points A, B, C, D ... see Fig. 3 on the programmed path wire electrode path lying on the lower surface of the workpiece will be x Though the foregoing description does not deal with a color display, it is of course possible to adopt an arrangement in which the wire electrode paths on the upper and lower surfaces of the workpiece and each cross sectional contour are displayed in different colors. To achieve such a color display, the frame memory 5d would be constituted by three frame memories for read, blue and green and, by way of example, the wire electrode path on the upper surface of the workpiece would be displayed in red, that on the lower surface of the workpiece in yellow, and each cross sectional contour in blue. In such case, the image of the wire electrode path on the upper surface of the workpiece produced by the vector generator 5b would be stored in the frame memory for red, the image of the wire electrode path on the lower surface of the workpiece would be stored in the two frame memories for red and green, the image of each cross sectional contour would be stored in the frame memory for blue, and these images would then be read out of the respective frame memories and applied to a predetermined grid electrode of a color cathode ray tube. According to the present invention as described above, it is arranged to display not only a wire electrode path constituting a programmed path on the lower surface of a workpiece i.e., the cut contour of the lower surface of the workpiece and a wire electrode path on the upper surface of the workpiece i.e,. the cut contour of the upper surface of the workpiece , but also a plurality of cross sectional contours, which lie parallel to the lower surface of the workpiece, of a taper cut surface in each block. Accordingly, the taper cut contour can be recognized with ease to simplify the checking of the program. In addition, the taper cut contour can be displayed not only as a projection on the XY plane but also as a perspective view. This makes it easy to comprehend the taper cute profile.
