# Apparatus for measurement of heart related parameters.

## Abstract
Blood volume variation of a peripheral part of the body of a patient, which variation is cyclic in nature, is detected to provide a signal representative of the blood volume. The maximum amplitude, minimum amplitude, amplitude of the signal at maximum slope, the time interval between the maximum and minimum amplitudes and the instantaneous cyclic repetition rate period of the signal are measured, and the parameters are calculated in accordance with appropri ate formulae.
