## Description
A METHOD FOR TEE OXYIATION OF AItANoLS This invention relates to the production of alkoxylated alcohols by reacting said alcohols in the presence of barium containing and strontium containing catalysts and promoters. More particularly, this invention relates to the pr iLztion of alkoxylated alcohols by reacting said alcohols in the presence of these barium containing and strontiumcontaining catalysts which are preformed prior to reacting adducting materials such as ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The general reaction of alcohols and adducting materials such as ethylene oxide to form alkoxylated alcohols ethylene oxide adducts has long been known and practiced on a commercial scale. For example, ethylene oxide adducts have been used as detergents and cleaning agents, domestic and industrial laundry detergents, detergent builders, polishers, sanitizers, and dry cleaning materials. Othcr users include the pulp and paper industry and the fiber industry. These materials are especially adapted to these uses since they have functional properties such as wetting power, foaming, emulsifying and dispersing abilities as well as solubilization and detergent abilities to facilitate their use. Much literature is available in the general area of ethoxylation of alcohols. Many references are also available relating to the catalytic ability of various materials and the mechanism and kinetics of these reactions.For example, French Patent 1,365,945 teaches the use of compounds containing an active hydrogen atom reacted with ethylene oxide in the presence of an alkali metal base Acidic catalysts in general are also known.However, the ethoxylation of alcohols invariably produces a distribution of various adducts. For example on surfactant applications, an adduct of too few ethylene oxide molecules is not effective because of poor solubility. In contrast, an adduct with too many ethylene oxide molecules is likewise undesirable because of surface tension reduction per unit mass decreases drastically with increase in the molecular weight. Thus it has long been essential to produce and use ethoxylates with as sharp a distribution in the desired mole adduct range 3 to 10 usually as possible. Acid catalyzed reactions produce such alkoxylates but these catalysts produce higher levels of some harmful side products such as dioxane which must be separated and removed prior to use Russian Patent 523,074 teaches that alkali metals and various carbonates can be used to catalyze these reactions.The side product formation in the base catalyzed reactions is very low, but in base catalyzed reactions the adduct distribution is undesirably broad. The result is that a large proportion of the product obtained is not useful or is less desirable because of distribution. Representative of but not exhaustive of the art in this area is U.S. Patent 3,328,467 which describes the use of zeolites and modified zeolites as catalysts in ethoxylation reactions. French Patent 1,557,407 uses triethyl oxonium fluoroborate to catalyze such reactions. Indeed, the art abounds with references to alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium and potassium hydroxides, tertiary amines and sodium metal. German Offenlegungsschrift 2,639,564 teaches polyalkoxylation of active hydrogen compounds in the presence of a sodium fluoroborate or perchlorates of metal such as magnesium, calcium, manganese, or zinc. U.S. Patent 3,969,417 uses tertiary oxonium salts as a catalyst. U.S. Patent 3,830,850 describes adding sodium, potassium, lithium, rubidium, cesium, calcium, barium, or strontium to condense phenols with formaldehyde, then adding ethylene oxide to the condensation product in an ethoxylation reaction. However, all these materials have the disadvantages described and set forth above. Great benefit would be provided by a catalyst system which provides the low by product levels of base catalysts yet has the narrow distribution of the preferred mole adducts obtained from acid catalysts together with reduced reaction time. Such a catalyst which would promote the narrowing of the product distribution curve would contribute significantly to the intrinsic value of the ethoxylate produced. Such a catalyst is described in U.S.application Serial Number 916,421, filed June 6, 1978. However, this catalyst has an induction period ranging up to about 20 minutes at 1780C. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a catalyst system which will yield a narrow mole adduct distribution from the reaction of alcohols of all classes with materials such as ethylene oxide and propylene oxide while providing low levels of undesirable by products and unreacted free alcohols, yet provide a reaction which is immediately effective with reduced induction period. Other objects will become apparent to those skilled in this art as the description proceeds. It has now been discovered according to the present invention that alkoxylation of alkanols containing from about 4 to about 36 carbon atoms can be carried out by contacting the alcohols with an alkoxylation agent in the presence of at least one material selected from the group consisting of barium metal, barium hydride, barium oxide, barium hydroxide, hydrated barium hydroxide, strontium metal, strontium hydride, strontium oxide, strontium hydroxide, hydrated strontium hydroxide, cr mixtures of these together with an effective amount of a catalyst promoter or mixture of catalyst promoters, where the strontium and or barium catalyst is preformed with a promoter, and wherein the alkoxylation reaction is carried out at temperatures of from about 1200C to about 2600C and wherein the catalyst promoter is selected from the group consisting of a polyols having a boiling point above 100 C and containing a total of 2 to 30 carbon atoms and having 2 or more adjacent or non adjacent hydroxyl containing groups of the general formulaEMI3.1 wherein R1, R2, and R3 are, independently, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, aryl groups, cyclic groups, or hydrogen and wherein the R designated groups can in addition contain one or more functional groups selected from the group consisting of ether, amine, carboxyl, halogen, nitro, carbonyl, and amide b aldehydes and ketones having boiling points above 1000C and containing a total of from 2 to 30 carbon atoms, and having one or more adjacent or non adjacent carbonyl containing groups of the general formulaEMI4.1 wherein R1 and R2 are, independ√ßntly, hydrogen, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, cyclic groups, or aryl groups and wherein the R designated groups can in addition contain one or more functionalities selected from the group consisting of carboxyl, hydroxyl, ether, halogen, nitro, amine, or amide c primary, secondary or tertiary amides having a boiling point of above 1000C and containing a total of from 1 to 30 carbon atoms and containing 1 or more amide containing groups of the general formulaEMI4.2 wherein R1, R2, and R3 are, independently hydrogen, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, cyclic groups or aryl groups and wherein the R designated groups can in addition contain one or more other functionalities selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, ether, carboxyl, carbonyl, amine, nitro, or halogen d primary, secondary or tertiary amines having a boiling point above 1000C, containing from a total of 1 to 30 carbon atoms and containing 1 or more amine containing groups of the general formula EMI5.1 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are, independently, hydrogen, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, cyclic groups, or aryl groups, and wherein the R designated groups can in addition contain one or more functionalities selected from the group consisting of hydroxyl, ether, carbonyl, halogen, carboxyl, nitro or amide e organic acids having a boiling point of above 1000C, containing from a total of 1 to 30 carbon atoms and having 1 or more adjacent or non adjacent carboxylic acid containing groups of the general formulaEMI5.2 wherein R1 is hydrogen, a linear or branched acyclic group, alicyclic group, cyclic group, or aryl group and wherein the R group can in addition contain one or more functionalities selected from the group consisting of carbonyl, hydroxyl, halogen, ether, nitro, amine, or amide f phenols having a boiling point of above 1000C, containing a total of from 6 to 30 carbon atoms and having 1 or more functionalities of the general formulaEMI5.3 wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, and R5 are, independently hydrogen, halogen, hydroxyl, nitro, ether, or carbonyl, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, cyclic groups, aryl groups, or substituted aryl groups and wherein in addition the R designated groups can contain one or more functionalities selected from the group consisting of halogen, ether, nitro, carbox lr carbonyl, amine, amide, or hydroxyl. Boiling points are measured at atmospheric pressure, and may be proportionally higher or lower as pressure is altered. These preformed catalysts are produced by simply contacting the catalytic metal compound and promoter together for a time and at a temperature sufficient to obtain the preformed material. Normally such reaction time ranges up to about two hours, but from 1 2 to one hour is preferred.Reaction temperatures range up to about 1750C, but reaction temperatures from about 1000C to about 1500C are preferred. For handling ease, a solvent effective for either or both the catalyst and promoter can optionally be used.Such solvents can operably but not necessarily be removed by heating until the preformed catalyst is obtained as a solid. The preferred catalysts of the present invention can be obtained as liquids if desired. Heating the preformed catalyst for a time and at a temperature sufficient to remove bound water is preferred, but is not critical. In many cases, the solvent is a material in itself capable of promoting the alkoxylation reaction and of producing a preformed catalyst.

dichlorophenol 2,5 dichlorophenol 2,5 dichlorohydroquinone 2 naphthol Certain alcohols can also act as promoters for ethoxylation of alcohols using barium containing and strontiumcontaining catalysts. Such alcohols are more acidic than normal alcohols such that the association constant is greater or the pKa is lower than normal alcohols. thus, these alcohol o otes would have a pea less than 1 These alcohols are those having tlle general formulaEMI12.1 wherein R1, R2 and R3 are, independently, hydrogen, linear or branched acyclic groups, alicyclic groups, aryl groups, or cyclic groups and wherein the R designated groups can in addition contain functional groups selected from the group consisting of halogen, nitro, cacboxyl, amine, carbonyl, ether, and amide. The molecule can contain a total of from 2 to 30 carbon atoms. Representative examples of these effective alcohols which can be used to preform catalysts are triphenylmethanol trichloroethanol trifluoroethanol 2 nitroethanol 2 chloroethanol 2,2 dichloroethanol 2 methoxyethanol 2 chlorocyclohexanol ortho chlorobenzyl alcohol Thus, the instant invention describes a method for the alkoxylation of alcohols comprising contacting said alcohols with an alkoxylating agent in the presence of strontium containing and barium containing catalysts together with an effective amount of a polyol, aldehyde, ketone, amine, amide, carboxylic acid, alcohol, substituted phenol or mixtures of these preformed into a catalyst effective to promote the reaction. Normally, the alkoxylation agentwill be bthylene oxide or propylene oxide.The instant invention can be carried out at temperatures of from about 90 C to about 2600C Normally, the alcohols reactive under the process of the instant invention will contain from about 4 to about 36 carbon atoms but alcohols of from about 4 to about 24 carbon atoms are more common. Those alcohols containing from about 8 to about 18 carbon atoms are most used for commercial processes. The process of the instant invention can be carried out at ambient pressures. However, pressures of up to 100 pounds per square inch gauge psig can also be used. i rt ssure.s below about 60 psig are preferred. In addition, pressures below ambient can be used. It is clear that while pressure or lack of pressure is not a detriment to the process of the instant invention, it is simply more convenient to carry out the reaction in the pressure range of from about atmospheric to about 100 psig. The instant invention is normally carried out at temperatures of from about 120 to about 260 C. However, for practical purposes, commercial operations will normally be carried out in the temperature range of from about 150 to about 2000C. Temperatures in the range of from 1600C to about 1900C are most preferred. Reactions can be carried out in the presence of any alkoxylation agent which produces a mole adduct of the sort desired. Normally such agents are alpha or beta alkylene oxides. In most commercial operations, either ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, or mixtures of these will be used to produce an adduct. Of these products, ethylene oxide is most preferred. Reaction products can have any desired content of alkoxylating agent such as ethylene oxide, but will normally range from about 30 to about 80 content of ethylene oxide EO based on weight. However, for most purposes, the content of ethylene oxide will range from about 40 to about 70t by weight. The amount of EO present in the reaction is not critical other than the minimum amount necessary to provide sufficient units to reach the mole adduct level desired for the alcohol being reacted. The catalysts of the present invention are basic catalysts which provide a sharp distribution of mole adducts formed, while greatly reducing the amount of unreacted free alcohols and undesirable by products normally found in sharp distribution reactions. The instant invention adds to this barium containing and strontium containing catalysts an effective amount of phenol, acid, amine, aldehyde, polyol, ketone, amide or alcohol and preforms the metal compound and promoter in order to further reduce by product reactions and to reduce or eliminate the induction period necessary for alkoxylation to begin. Representative examples of barium containing catalysts are barium metal, BaH2, BaO, Ba OH 2 and Ba OH 2.X H2O where X represents the number of water molecules present.X is not a critical number. Many of these barium compounds alone are effective in the process of the instant invention and are extremely active when used as a preformed catalyst with an effective amount of a promoter. Representative examples of strontium containing catalysts are strontium metal, SrH2, SrO, Sr OH 2 and Sr OH 2. X H2O where X represents the number of water molecules present. X is not a critical number. Many of these strontium compounds are effective alone in the process of the instant invention and are extremely effective when used as a preformed catalyst with an effective amount of a promoter. Barium and strontium catalysts in their various forms and with the promoters listed can be used together with excellent results. Many combinations are possible and while some will be more effective than others, all will beneficially promote alkoxylation of alcohols. Synergistic results can be expected with mixtures of metal catalysts and or promoters. When used, these catalyst mixtures can be used in any desired quantity. The larger the quantity used, the more quickly the reaction goes to completion, although larger quantities do not appear to significantly alter the distribution obtained. However, for practical purposes, normally from about 0.1 weight percent preformed catalyst based upon the weight of the alcohol to be reacted, would be present in the reaction, but from 0.1 to 5.0 weight percent is more commonly used, and from 0.1 to about 2.0 weight percent is most preferred, The amount of promoter or co catalyst which should be present in the preformed catalyst is generally an effective amount. The effect of the co catalyst or promoter becomes significant at about 0.1 by weight based upon the weight of the alcohol to be reacted.It is logical to expect an upper limit after which the amount of promoter present will produce no additional benefits, especially since preforming the catalyst further reduces induction periods, ever. to insignificant levels. Normally, these materials will be added to barium and strontium compounds in amounts ranging from about 0.1 to about 2.08 by weight based upon the weight of the alcohol to be reacted, then preformed. Although amounts ranging from about 0.15 to about 1.5 are preferred, and amounts ranging from about 0.3 to about 0.8 by weight based upon the weight of alcohol to be reacted is most preferred. However, it is very apparent that these limits can be varied substantially since the co catalyst is more effective when preformed. While the instant invention is effective with all classes of alkanols, both primary, secondary, tertiary, linear and branched, linear and branched primary alkanols are the most commonly used alcohols and are the preferred alcohols of the instant invention. Representative examples of such alcohols are those derived by hydrogenation of natural fats and oils, such as CO and TA alcohols, trademark of and sold by Proctor and Gamble Co., such as CO 1214N alcohol,CO 1618 alcohol, and TA 1618 alcohol, and ADOL alcohols, trademark of and sold by Ashland Oil Co., such as ADOL 54 alcohol, ADOL 61 alcohol, ADOL G4 alcohol, ADOL 60 alcohol and ADOL 66 alcohol.

The invention is extremely useful for oxo alcohols hydroformylation produced from olefines.

Generally, the treatment of alcohols with ethylene oxide yields a non ionic detergent since hydrogen bonding to the numerous oxygen atoms makes the polyether end of the molecule water soluble. Alternatively, the ethoxylates can be converted into sulfates and used in the form of alkali metal or ammonium salts. The instant invention provides for the production of highly efficient alcohol alkoxylates from primary, secondary and tertiary branched chain and straight chained alcohols in a novel, highly unexpected manner. Of these, primary alkanols are preferred. These alkanols normally have from about 4 to about 20 carbon atoms, but from about 4 to about 36 carbon atoms can also be used. Reaction products are useful as non ionic surface active agents with high wetting power and are composed with mixtures of mono alkyl ethers of polyethylene glycol. Thus in the preferred form of the instant invention, ethylene oxide is reacted with a branched chain or straight chain higher alkanol in the presence of barium bases or strontium bases promoted by an effective amount of amines, amides, aldehydes, polyols, carboxylic acids, ketones, and substituted phenols which have been pre formed into an alkoxylation catalyst. The invention is more concretely described with reference to the examples below wherein all parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. The examples are provided to illustrate the instant invention and not to limit it. Example 1 A small round bottom flask was charged with 10 grams Sr OH 2 .8 H2O and 10.6 grams phenol. The flask was attached to a rotary evaporator and the contents heated to 1500C for 1 hour under vacuum. The weight of 9.55 grams of preformed catalyst was recovered. Example 2 A stainless steel reactor 600 cc was charged with 150 grams Alfol 1214 alcohol trademark of and sold byConoco Inc. and 0.8 grams preformed strontium hydroxide phenol catalysts as prepared in Example 1. After purging with nitrogen at 250 cc per minute for 1 hour at a temperature of 1500C the reactor was evacuated and the temperature raised to about 175 C. Ethylene oxide EO was then introduced to a total pressure of about 40 pounds per square inch gauge psig and an EO uptake of 150 grams was allowed to proceed at this pressure. After ethoxylation the catalyst was neutralized. Ethoxylation required 65 minutes for completion.The product contained 0.5 polyethylene glygol PEG and had a pour point of 40 OF. Free alcohol content in the product was 3.8 . Example 3 A small flask was charged with 10.0 grams Sr OH 2.H20 and 10.7 grams l naphthol together with 17.8 grams of ethanol. The mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at about 240C and the solution filtered through Whatman No. 50 filter paper. The resulting filtrate was a dark fluid preformed catalyst easily handled in commercial operations. Example 4 A stainless steel reactor of 600 cc capacity was charged with 120 grams of Alfol 1214 alcohol and 1.6 grams of preformed catalyst described in Example 3. After purging with nitrogen at 250 cc per minute for 1 hour at a temperature of 1500C, the reactor was evacuated and the temperature raised to about 1750C. Ethylene oxide was then introduced to a total pressure of about 40 psig and an EO uptake of 180 grams was allowed to proceed at this pressure. After ethoxylation, the catalyst was neutralized. The ethoxylation required 141 minutes for completion. Example 5 A 250 cc flask was charged with 10 grams ofSr OH 2.H2O, 7.8 grams of phenol, and 10.0 grams of water.The mixture was stirred at about 600C and the resulting solution filtered through Whatman No. 50 filter paper.
