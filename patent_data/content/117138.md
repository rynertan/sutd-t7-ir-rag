# APPARATUS FOR APPLYING ADDITIVES TO A FILTER TOW

## Abstract
A filter tow blooming jet device 14 for applying an additive to a continuous, multifilament filter tow is provided with orifice means 20 transversely positioned in an elon gated passageway 21 through which the advancing filter tow passes. Additive is applied to the tow by nozzle means 60 concentrically positioned with respect to the advancing filter tow at a point downstream of the orifice means 20 . The additive may additionally be applied to the filter tow by nozzle means 38, 42 positioned adjacent to the wall surface of the elongated passageway 21 or by injecting the additive via a nozzle 50 into a stream of gaseous fluid introduced into the jet device via conduit 18 for blooming the filter tow.
