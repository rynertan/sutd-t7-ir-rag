# APPARATUS FOR CRIMPING TOWS OF FILAMENTS AT HIGH SPEED

## Abstract
An apparatus for crimping a tow of filaments 16 comprises a pair of cylindrical feed rolls 10, 10 disposed to form a nip A therebetween and a stuffer box 12 disposed adjacent to the nip A , the stuffer box 12 including an inner wall portion 14 confronting to a pair of coplanar end surfaces 18, 18 of the feed rolls 10, 10 across said nip A with a slight clearance therebetween for frictional engage ment with the filaments 16 as the latter is moved in a region located immediately downstream of the nip A and defined jointly by the inner wall portion 14 and respective peripher al surfaces of the feed rolls 10, 10 . The inner wall portion 14 is movable in a direction substantially the same direction as the advance of the filaments 16 in the region while renewing with respect to the frictional engagement with the filaments 16 . The tow crimping apparatus thus comstructed is durable and performs crimping operation at a high speed without producing hard lump due to fusion in the tow as the latter is crimped.
