# Comminuting machine with feed worm, especially for comminuting frozen meat.

## Abstract
In a comminuting machine with a feed worm 3 in the bottom of an infeeding hopper 4 and a comminuting mechanism, e.g. consisting of a delivery worm 5 , a rotating knife set 6 and a stationary perforated disk 7 , the feed worm 3 is shaped in the form of one single convolution or turn, possibly a number of worm convolutions or turns not shown , with no central core or shaft. The result of this arrangement is that the sharp edge or knife edge 10 of the feed worm 3 lying forwardmost in the direction of rotation all else being equal can attack a block not shown of frozen meat in a location proportionately higher than the lower end of the block than by using the previously known feed worm with a central shaft or core that prevents the block from moving so far in the downward direction as is possible in the machine shown with no core or central shaft in the feed worm 3 . In the preferred embodiment shown, the feed worm 3 consists of a thick walled tube of e.g steel, in which well over one half of the tube has been cut away along helical surfaces forming sharp edges 10,11 with the outside surface of the tube, of which edges one constitutes the knife edge 10 mentioned above.
