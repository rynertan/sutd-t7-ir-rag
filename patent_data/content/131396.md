# Non marring lifting clamp.

## Abstract
A non marring lifting clamp 10 for articles such as metal plates has a pair of opposed jaws 24, 26 mounted on oppo site sides of a slot 22 formed in the side plates 12, 14 of the clamp body with one 24 of the jaws being pivotally mounted for opening and closing movements relative to the other jaw 26 , and a lifting shackle 50 being mounted for guided movement in the clamp body. A linkage assembly in the body couples the shackle to the pivotally mounted gripping jaw to urge the gripping jaw toward the other jaw when a lifting force is applied to the shackle. The linkage assembly includes a swing link 32 connected to move the gripping jaw and a control link 40 pivoted to the clamp body with a connecting mechanism coupling the control link both to the shackle and the swing link. A manually operated pivotally mounted handle 60 accessible exteriorly of the clamp body operates a locking mechanism which includes a coil spring 70 associated with the control link, this spring acting on such control link and being tensioned or released by operation of the handle. The locking mechanism includes a cam link mechanism con nected to be shifted by handle movements, the cam link mechanism cooperating through the coil spring with the con trol link to bias the control link alternately in jaw open position or jaw closing position while still allowing limited opening movement of the jaws by overcoming the biasing force of the tensioned coil spring. The lifting clamp further has the other jaw carried on a manually adjustable wedge 88 with visually observable indicia 100 associated with this other jaw and also with the gripping jaw for the operator to visually deter mine the clamp s suitability in handling a particular size plate to be lifted.
