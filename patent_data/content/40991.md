# Preparation of insecticidal mixture of stereoisomers of alpha cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl isovalerates.

## Abstract
The method is for preparation of a mixture of ste reoisomers of Î± cyano 3 phenoxybenzyl 2 4 chlorophe nyl isovalerate or the derivative having 4 fluoro on the phenoxy nucleus. The compounds each have an asym metric carbon atom in the alcohol and acid moieties. The starting material is a mixture of one of these esters which contains 35 to 65 of an enantiomer pair of isomers of respectively S configuration and R confi guration on both moieties, the balance being a mixture of the other S R and R S pair. This material is dissolved in a solvent, such as an alkanol or an aliphatic or ali cyclic hydrocarbon usually seed crystals comprising the desired isomer pair S R and R S are added and crystallization thereof takes place of this pair. The crystals are removed, e.g. by filtration residual liquid contains the desired S S and R R enantiomer pair which can be recovered by evaporation in vacuo. The product has high insecticidal and or acaricidal efficacy.
