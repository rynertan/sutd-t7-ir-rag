# Illumination apparatus for a document scanner.

## Abstract
An illumination system for a document scanner com prising a fluorescent lamp 10 for illuminating a document 1 to be scanned and a light guide 14 which pipes the light to the target document area 18 . The fluorescent lamp 10 has an aperture 12 defined by an aperture angle wherein the lamp radiance is determined by the aperture angle. The light guide 14 has a trapezoidal longitudinal cross section. An input window associated with the narrow base 16 of the trapezoidal shape light guide 14 is coupled to the aperture 12 of the lamp 10 . An output window associated with the wide base 20 of the trapezoidal shape light guide 14 is directed to the document area 18 . The design of the illumination system includes having the magnitudes of the guide angle 17 , the scan distance 11 , the narrow base 16 , the wide base 20 , and the length 21 of the light guide 14 optimized so as to maximize the product of the lamp radi ance and the solid angle 19 subtended by the wide base 20 from points inside the document area whereby the amount of light delivered to the document area 18 is maximized.
