# Crosslinkable polyethylene composition.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a composition compris ing crosslinkable polyethylene homopolymer, copolymer or mixture thereof. The composition includes a peroxide cros slinking agent, a crosslinking co agent, and a metal com pound having a cation selected from Group IIA and IIB of the Periodic Table of Elements. The composition is particularly useful for polymers which are formed using Ziegler type catalysts and have complete terminal saturation. The present invention also includes a composition which has been found particularly suitable for use in critical molding processes such as rotational molding. This composition comprises a polyethylene homopolymer, copolymer, or mixture thereof. The present invention includes a method of rotational molding.
