# FUEL INJECTION TIMING CONTROL SYSTEM FOR AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE, AND CONTROL METHOD THEREFOR

## Abstract
A fuel injection control system for an internal combus tion engine having a fuel injection valve located near an intake port can control the timing of fuel injection in synchronism with engine revolution. The fuel injection control system improves fuel atomization characteristics and uniformity of air fuel mixture entering the engine cylinders. The control system controls the fuel injection timing so that the fuel injection occurs within a valve overlap period during which an intake valve and an exhaust valve are both open. In order to precisely control the fuel injection timing, the piston stroke of each engine cylinder is detected with reference to the crank shaft angular position.
