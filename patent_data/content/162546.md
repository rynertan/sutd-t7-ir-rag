# Molded fibrous filtration products.

## Abstract
Molded filtration products, such as disposable face masks, are prepared by assembling at least one fibrous shap ing layer 14, 16 and one fibrous filtration layer 15 in face to face contact and subjecting the assembly to heat and molding pressure. Preferably the assembly comprises two shaping layers 14, 16 , one on each side of the filtration layer 15 . The shaping layers in total weigh no more than about 150 pounds per ream 250 grams per square meter and con tribute no more than about 20 percent of the total pressure drop through the filtration product. At least one of the shap ing layers comprises fibers that can be bound together at points of fiber intersections by coalescence of binder material on the fibers.
