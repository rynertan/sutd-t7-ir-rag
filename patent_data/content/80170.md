# Field emission type ion source.

## Abstract
The field emission type ion source comprises an emitter tip 2 , a heater 1 , a reservoir 3 which stores material to be ionized, an extracting electrode 6 situated at the front end of the emitter tip, and a coating layer 4 which is refractory and anti reactive with the material to be ionized and which is coat ed on at least the heater of the emitter tip and heater, in order to prevent their reactions with the material to be ionized.
