# Modular display device and display module therefor.

## Abstract
The display device is built up of comparatively small dis play modules. Each module has an IC chip 6 on which display driving circuitry and address circuitry is provided and which has picture element electrodes 5. In the display device each IC chip 6 is arranged with its picture element electrodes 5 facing a display medium 7, for example liquid crystal, in a stacked ele ment structure. Stacked element structures DM₁₁ to DM₅₆ are assembled together on a common mounting substrate 11 to provide a flat display panel with a comparatively large screen size. In addition to addressing circuitry, each IC chip 6 may in clude memory element circuitry for display module selection.
