# Battery saving frequency synthesizer arrangement.

## Abstract
The phase locked loop section 10, 14 of the synthesizer is periodically disconnected from the battery supplied power by means of a switch 60 . In order to prevent substantial drift of the phase locked loop during such power interruption, means 22, 24 are provided for maintaining a control signal on the VCO 12 associated with the loop 10 that maintains the VCO frequency. By minimizing the frequency drift, the loop can be re locked in a short period of time following each power interruption.
