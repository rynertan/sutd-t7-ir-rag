# Premix compositions for use in the production of flame retardant polyurethane foams.

## Abstract
The storage stability of otherwise unstable premix compositions for flame retardant polyurethane foams containing in the premix a halogenated polyol and a tertiary amine catalyst can be enhanced by incorporating into the premix a condensation product of acrylic or methacrylic acid with an alcohol or an amine.
