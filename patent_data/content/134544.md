# Variable band distributed switching node with dynamic hybrid frame management.

## Abstract
The variable band distributed switching node comprises a plurality of independent modules MU1...MGm connected to a common bus 1 . Each module comprises a portion IU, HL, SL, PL processing line information, and an interface IB towards the bus which cooperates with the interfaces of the other modules to form hybrid frames on the bus, which frames comprise a plurality of channels assigned to circuit switched communications and a residual band portion shared by packet switched communications. Such frames are dynamically managed by assigning each circuit switched channel a band which can be different in the different frames to match the requirements of variable band sources and by making again the channels adjoining after each release.
