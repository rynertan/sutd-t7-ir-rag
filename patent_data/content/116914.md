# Preparation of optically active alpha substituted carboxylic esters and acids.

## Abstract
Optically active alpha substituted carboxylic esters are prepared by treating a non symmetrical ketene with an alcohol in the presence of an optically active amine catalyst. Hydrolysis of the resulting esters, yields the optically active acid corresponding to the non symmetrical ketene.
