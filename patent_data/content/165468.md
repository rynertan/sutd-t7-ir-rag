# Apparatus for adjusting specific volume of intake air for engine.

## Abstract
An apparatus for adjusting the specific volume of intake air for an engine has an orifice 5 for controlling the amount of air to by pass a throttle valve. The apparatus is provided with a lattice shaped heating element 8 which is disposed on the downstream side of the orifice. Thus, carbon and other substances which may flow back from the engine are trapped and burnt by the heating element.
