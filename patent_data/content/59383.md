# Improver for the color fastness of dyed cotton textiles to chlorinated water and process for improving the color fastness of dyed cotton textiles to chlorinated water.

## Abstract
An agent for improving the color fastness of dyed cotton fibers and textiles to chlorinated water which comprises a specific diamine compound. The combination of the diamine and a hydrolyzable tannin further increases the color fast ness to chlorinated water. The tannin can be more strongly fixed to the fibers by further treating with a metal salt, whereby an excellent color fastness to chlorinated water can be maintained for a prolonged period of time.
