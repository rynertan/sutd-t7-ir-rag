# Input circuit with plurality of channels.

## Abstract
An input circuit 11 has a plurality of channels 12 0 12 n , each channel comprising a conductor 13 0 13 n , a first transistor 21 0 21 n and a second transistor 22 0 22 n both inserted into the conductor in series therewith, and a third transistor 23 0 23 n . When a channel is not selected, the first and second transistors 21 0 21 n, 22 0 22 n are turned off and the third transistor 23 0 23 n is turned on to clamp the conductor at a predetermined constant voltage GND . When a channel is selected, the third transistor 23 0 23 n is turned off and the first and second transistors 21 0 21 n, 22 0 22 n are turned on to transfer the corresponding information input therethrough.
