# A METHOD OF FRACTURING A SUBTERRANEAN FORMATION

## Abstract
In a method for controlling the vertical growth of hydraulic fractures in subterranean formations, the fractur ing gradients of adjacent formations are determined and are used to calculate the fluid density necessary to inhibit the propagation of a hydraulic fracture from one adjacent formation into the other. A fracturing fluid is then prepared having the necessary density for inhibiting such hydraulic fracture propagation.
