## Description
ANALOG TO DIGITAL CONVERTER The invention relates to an analog to digital converter on a single integrated circuit chip utilizing charge transfer technology. Chargs coupled semiconductor devices were first described in an article of similar title as published in the Bell SystemTechnical Journal, Volume 49, Number 4, 1970, pages 587 to 593.Since that time much research has been conducted on CCD s to the present time wherein 64 kilo bit single chip CCD memories have reached the commercial marketplace. IEEE Spectrum, May 1978, page 36 . Memories are not the only use for CCD s however. CCD s can be utilized in image sensing arrays and also for analog signal processors Electronic Design 6, March 15, 1976, page 70 . However, the prior art does not show the use of CCD technology to provide an analog to digital converter wherein the actual conversion is accomplished directly on the CCD integrated circuit chip itself. It is an object of the present invention to overcome this deficiency and to provide such an analog to digital converter which is characterised in that an analog to digital converter on a single integrated circuit chip utilizing charge transfer technology, characterised in that it comprises a cell including input gate means for receiving an input analog signal represented by packets of charge, transfer gate means coupled to said input gate means for transferring any such packets of charge, and floating gate means coupled to said transfer gate means for detecting the presence of charge transferred, an excess of charge transferred, or no charge transferred, the output of said floating gate means being a pair of digital logic voltage signals indicative of these three conditions. Such a device reduces the number of CCD and other type integrated circuit chips and increases signal to noise, amplification ratios, etc, due to the fact that the entire analog to digital conversion is done on one device. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a plurality of said cells are an analog to digital converter as claimed in any one of Claims 1 to 5 wherein a plurality of said cells are arranged in serial fashion on said single integrated circuit chip in charge transfer proximity to one another to thereby form an analog to digital register of said plurality of cells. As large scale integrated circuit techniques are extensive in the modern technology, construction of more that one such analog to digital conversion circuit on one chip is possible.Thus, coupling the CCD A D conversion cells together by transfer gate technology leads to the construction of a multi stage analog to digital converter on a single LSI chip utilizing CCD technology. Coupling more than one cell to another will allow for multi bit outputs to be generated in increasing resolution depending on the number of stages. That is, if 16 cells are coupled together, 16 levels of gray can be detected, if used in an imaging system for example, or 16 discrete digital voltage levels can be detected from the input anaolog signals. Transfer gates are used to couple succesive cells to each other to provide conduction paths for the packets of charge generated. For a more complete understanding of the invention, reference may be had to the following detailed description of the invention in conjunction with the drawings wherein Figure 1 is a schematic representation of an analog to digital signal converter cell utilizing the charge coupled transfer technology Figure 2 is a timing diagram of the application of voltage signals to the converter described in conjunction with Figure 1 and Figure 3 is a schematic representation of the multi stage analog to digital converter utilizing a plurality of cells shown and described in conjunction with Figures 1 and 2. charge coupled devices are inherently analog devices due to the fact that the charge packets associated with each individual charge coupled device on a silicon substrate vary from zero to a predetermined maximum value, depending upon the applied voltage to that particular CCD. Thus, charge coupled devices are ideal for use wherein an input signal is of an analog nature which can be subsequently utilized with subsequent circuitry for modifying, encoding, amplifying, etc., any particular signal output. Further, CCD s lend themselves to large scale integrated circuit techniques for manufacture where the density of the circuits on a substrate chip run into the thousands and which allow CCD s to be valuable in analog situations.In certain instances, an analog signal is desired to be converted to digital signals, and many such techniques are old in the art, as analog to digital conversion is a well known technique and has been for many years. However, analog to digital conversion using charge transfer technology in a charge coupled device is a new concept and the art is sparse in this area. One such reference is entitled An Analog to Digital Converter Using Charge Transfer Technology on Page 4 of the 1977 IEEE International Solid StateCircuits Conference Proceedings. However, a charge coupled device which is able to convert a signal from analog to digital form on one integrated circuit chip has not been disclosed in the prior art previous to this application. The obvious advantages of utilizing analog to digital conversion on a single chip are many fold.For example, converting an analog signal to a digital signal within the confines of a single charge coupled device integrated circuit chip allows for much higher accuracy in the conversion process because the obvious use of fewer circuits and components decreases the chances for error, noise, etc. Further, analog to digital conversion on a single integrated circuit chip allows for immediate digital operation in essentially an analog enviroment. Figure 1 shows a typical cell embodying the principles of the present invention. Since the individual gates and other components shown in Figure 1 may be part of a larger integrated circuit, the arrows shown are not strictly electrical connections in the typical sense, but are paths for which either a charge or a voltage is applied or for charge to be moved from one area to another on the integrated circuit chip. Thus,Figure 1 shows an input gate A and as an input to the gate there is a charge path for which charge may be applied to the gate. Also, connected to input gate A is a voltage Vl which is applied to establish the depth of the depletion layer to establish the amount of charge that can be stored in the input gate. Figure 2 depicts a timing diagram for the application of the various voltage potentials.From input gate A are shown two arrows which denote paths of movement of charge from this depletion layer to gates B and C. Coupled to the input of gate B is voltage V3 and coupled to gate C is voltage V2 which establish the depletion layers for these gates, respectively. Also shown in Figure 1 is a charge sensing amplifier CSA which comprises a floating gate masterFGM and floating gate slave FGS which are coupled together to a field effect transistor FET. Shown coupled to the intersection of the line from the FGM and theFGS is a line coupled to the source of the field effect transistor FET. Coupled to the drain of the FET is voltage VS and coupled to the gate of the FET is voltage VG. Also coupled to the path between gate B and theFGS is gate D which has an input of voltage V4. The output from the FGS is considered Output Number I and the output of gate D is considered the Output Number 2. hese outputs have on the line a voltage level of a logic zero or a voltage level of a logic one in binary terms. This is a digital output which can be used for a subsequent operation either on the integrated circuit chip itself or directed to an output circuit as will be discussed below. However, it is to be understood that an analog charge Q applied to analog gate A generates, in a manner to be hereinafter described, voltage signals on Outputs Number 1 and 2 which are 1seen to be digital. The charge input into input gate A for purposes of explaining the operation of the circuit in Figure l, is, for ease of description, defined as being at 2Q.This charge can be generated in any of the known manners for use in operating a charge coupled device, such as from another stage in a charge coupled device or from the use of the charge coupled device in an imaging technique wherein light impinges upon a photosite, such as is used when CCD s are used in an imaging environment.If the charge of 2Q is applied to input gate A when the predetermined voltage Vl is applied to gate A, the depletion layer formed at gate A by the voltage will be quickly filled with the charge in the manner known in the art in the operation of charge coupled devices.As described above, CCD gates C and B are coupled to the output of gate A. Upon application of voltage V2 See Figure 2 on gate C, and if the voltage V2 is also carefully predetermined, the excess charge of lQ occupying the depletion layer in gate A will be quickly transferred to gate C in the normal CCD charge transfer technique. In the charge sensing amplifier, CSA, the voltageVS is applied to the drain terminal of the field effect transistor FET which is part of the integrated circuit on the chip along with the rest of the CCD circuit being described herein. When voltage VG is applied to the field effect transistor FET at the gate terminal,the voltage VS is immediately applied to point P which is shown to be between the floating gate master FGM and the floating gate slave FGS.Once voltage VS is applied to point P, voltage VG is turned off and the voltageVS will remain at point P. Thus, in order to energize initially the FGM and the FGS, voltage VG will be applied prior to applying voltage Vl to input gate A. If voltageVG had been applied initially as just explained, when voltage V2 is applied to gate C, and there is an excess charge of Q in the input gate A, this charge will be transferred through gate C to the FGM. When charge is deposited under the FGM gate, the surface potential under the FGS gate will be changed toward zero volts. Returning to input gate A, the remaining chargeQ is detected at gate B and is transferred, when voltageV3 is applied to gate B to the FGS. Since the FGS surface potential has increased from its initial position, because of charge being deposited under the FGM gate, the charge under gate B, if there is any, will be blocked by the surface potential barrier under the FGS gate.Thus, the ouput of the FGS will remain at a logic zero.However, since the charge from gate B has not been transferred to the FGS, when voltage V4 is applied to gateD, gate D will now have the charge transfer from gateB to gate D, and thus at the application of voltage V4 the charge will be transferred through gate D to the output and detected as a logic one. Thus, when a charge of 2Q or maximum charge to fill input gate A is applied to gate A, Output 1 will have a logic zero and Output 2 will have a logic one. Assume now that only a charge of Q is applied to gate A. Voltage VG had been applied to the FET and thus voltage VS appears at point P between FGM and FGSSince there is no excess charge in gate A after application of voltage Vl, upon the application of voltage V2 to gate C, no excess charge is transferred via gate C from gate A to the FGM. Accordingly, there is no change of the surface potential of the FGS from the influence of the FGM. Therefore, when voltage V3 is applied to gate B, the charge Q in gate A will be transgerred to gate B. However, as voltage VS appears at,point P, FGS is enabled and thus when voltage V3 is applied to gate B, the charge Q on gate A will be transferred via gateB to the FGS which now detects the charge and the OutputNumber 1 may be considered, therefore, to be a logic one.When it comes time for voltage V4 to be applied to gate D, no charge remains on input gate A to be transferred via gate B and thus Output 2 is considered a logic zero. Thus, when only a charge of Q appears at inputGate A, Output 1 is a logic one and Output 2 is a logic zero. When the input charge to gate A is zero, no charge can be transferred to either FGM or gate D and thus the output at Outputs 1 and 2 are both logic zero.Accordingly, it is apparent then that depending upon the charge level applied to the input gate A, the output from Outputs 1 and 2 will be the logic levels as set forth above. Further, a charge applied to gate A less than Q will render Output 1 at logic one and Output 2 at logic zero. Thus, the cell described logic zero.Thus, the cell described in Figure l will operate as a true analog to digital converter. For ease of description, the input charge was defined as 2Q. The charge, in actuality, can be any defined level, the circuit will divide the charge in half. The description above has related to the description of how one CCD cell effects the analog to digital conversion. By the use of a plurality of these cells and transfer gates to couple them together, the multi stage analog to digital converter of the present invention can be constructed. Attention is now drawn to Figure 3. Each rectangle with a C in it is representative of one CCD cell described above in configuration with Figures 1 and 2. For convenience, the various inputs and outputs of the single cell described above will be listed here 2Q input, Output Number I is logic 0. 2Q input, Output Number 2 is logic 1. lQ input, Output Number 1 is logic I. lQ input, Output Number 2 is logic 0. No input, Output Number l is logic o. No input, Output Number 2 is logic 0. Figure 3 depicts at least five of such cells with a possibility of N cells. Only the state of the art in the manufacture of integrated circuits limits the number of cells that may be constructed on a single silicon chip. Each of the cells has an input to a gateA as seen in Figure 1. However, only cell Cl in Figure 3 receives an input charge from an external source. The other input gates receive the excess charge packets over and above what is capable of saturating the depletion layer in gate A of cell 1. This excess charge is transferred from cell 1 to cell 2 towards cell N, filling each depletion layer on its way, by means of the transfer gates constructed between the input gates A of the plurality of cells in the register or array. Each of these cells operates in the same manner. For example, if the cell receives the defined charge of 2Q, Output 1 would be a logic zero and Output 2 would be a logic one. Thus, if cell C5 received a charge of 2Q, for example, Output 5A would be a logic zero and Output SB would be a logic one, and so forth. Referring to Figure 3, it is to be assumed for purposes of illustration that the input charge to cell Cl is 7Q. Cell Cl would fill its depletion layer to 2Q and 5Q would spill over to cell C2. Cell C2 would fill its depletion layer to 2Q and 3Q would spill over to cell C3. Cell C3 would fill its depletion layer to 2Q and IQ would spill over to cell C4. Cell C5 received no charge at all. Referring to the chart above, the outputs from cells Cl, C2, and C3 would be the same, or logic zero and logic one respectively from the OutputsA and B. Cell C4, having only received lQ of charge would have at its outputs 4A and 4B, logic one and logic zero, respectively.Cell C5, having received no charge at all, would have at its outputs 5A and 5B, logic zero and logic zero, respectively. Depending on the amount of input charge received and the number of cells, theOutputs of the respective cells will have a representative number of cells with its Outputs the same, cellsCl, C2, C3, for example , one cell could have a transition logic level cell C4, for example , and the remaining cells could have its outputs the same, but opposed to the first group of cells cells C5 to CN, for example . It can, therefore, be clearly seen that the multi stage array as set forth in Figure 3 generates digital signals specifically related to the applied analog signal. This invention has application whenever analog signals must be converted to a multi level digital signal. For example, in data transmission modems, it may be desired to convert the analog signal to.a multilevel digital signal, with each level encoded at a different transmission frequency. The present invention would accomplish the analog to digital conversion on a single CCD integrated circuit chip. Another application of the invention described herein is in the use with image devices. An image can be scanned and a signal generated, as at the output of a photocell, for example. Or the light may impinge directly on a photosite on the CCD integrated circuit directly. In any event, the charge, defined as Q, is generated in proportion to the amount of light received from the image. Or the reverse if a reverse or negative image is scanned or desired. If, for instance, there were sixteen cells in the array described in conjunction with Figure 3, the light level would have been discerned to change at the output level generated by Cell C4.Cells Cl to C3 would be a value lighter than the detected level while cells C5 to C16 would be a value darker than the detected level. Or it can be said that the light received was level 4 on a gray scale range of 1 to 16. Subsequent logic circuitry coupled to the outputs of the cells can be used for detection, encoding, etc., of the detected gray levels. This logic circuitry could be part of the integrated circuit or external to the integrated circuit. In one instance, for example, the logic levels from Outputs 1 and 2 from each cell of logic zero and logic one could be searched for alone, because all the values above this cell would be the same while all the values below the cell would be the same, but different of course from the opposite level detected.This would mean that only the outputs from one cell have to be encoded, because the other cells outputs may be redundant. This invention would readily be adaptable for considerable use and value in an imaging system where analog to digital conversion is a necessity. Facsimile and digital television transmission are typical examples.
