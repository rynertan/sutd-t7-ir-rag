# POTATO PRODUCT AND PROCESS

## Abstract
A novel potato product is produced by separating the peel from potatoes, homogenising the separated peel, option ally after reducing its water content, forming the resulting ho mogenised peel into a thin layer and fixing the peel in that form. The product may if desired be formed into potato shapes and then filled with potato.
