# Apparatus for checking containers.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an apparatus for checking con tainers, e.g. bottles or pots by means of a transport appara tus for transporting the containers along a predetermined path and a lighting apparatus positioned at a side of said path, e.g. at least one flash light means, and a sensing ap paratus, e.g. at least one video camera positioned on a cor responding position, said transport apparatus being pro vided, in the area of said lighting apparatus and said sens ing apparatus a part, in which the containers are hung by their collars. The invention proposes to adapt an apparatus of the type mentioned in the preamble in such a way that in said part of said transport apparatus the path is rectilinear, thus avoiding the need of using means to counteract the oblique position necessary in prior art apparatus, in which the path is curved, and avoiding mechanical load due to centrifugal forces.
