# High pressure discharge lamp.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a high pressure discharge lamp having a discharge envelope 3 with a ceramic wall provided with at least one electrode 4 . The electrode 4 comprises a rod 41 which is connected to a tubular lead through member 40 and on which an emitter containing element 42 is arranged. By means of a screening body 43 , the emittercontaining element 42 is screened on its outer side. According to the invention, the screening body 43 extends with a constant cross section from the tubular lead through member 40 to the end of the emitter containing element 42 facing the discharge path. Thus, an improved temperature control is obtained within the discharge envelope 3 during operation of the lamp.
