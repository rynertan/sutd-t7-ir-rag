# SYMBOLIC LANGUAGE DATA PROCESSING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A symbolic language data processing system comprises a sequencer SQ unit, a data path DP unit, a memory control MC unit, a front end processor FEP , an I O unit I O and a main memory MM connected on a common Lbus LBUS to which other devices OD like peripheral and data units can be connected for intercommunication. The system architecture includes a novel bus network, a syner gistic combination of the Lbus, microtasking, centralized error correction circuitry and a synchronous pipelined mem ory including processor mediated direct memory access, stack cache windows with two segment addressing, a page hash table and page hash table cache, garbage collection and pointer control, a close connection of the macrocode and microcode which enables one to take interrupts in and out of the macrocode instruction sequences, parallel data type checking with tagged architecture, procedure call and micro code support, a generic bus and a unique instruction set to support symbolic language processing.
