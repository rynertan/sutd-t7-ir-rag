## Description
Signal Processing Apparatus The present invention relates to a signal processing apparatus for processing signals before or after frequency modulation in video equipment. New video media such as home video tape recorders VTR , video discs, optical fiber cable and broadcasting satellites have been progressed in recent years. With this trend, higher picture quality and greater definition are increasingly required in video equipment, for making better use of the features of these new media. VTR s, which record and reproduce video signals, conventionally employ frequency modulation demodulation based recording. When white noise is present in FM transmission lines, noises applied to demodulated signals have the so called triangle noise characteristic, in which noise level increases with frequency.To reduce this noise level, levels of the intermediate and high frequency areas of the input video signal are emphasized prior to frequency modulation emphasis so as to increase frequency deviation, and de emphasized after frequency demodulation de emphasis . However, since the frequency band in FM transmission lines is restricted by electromagnetic transformation, increase in frequency deviation by the emphasis is limited.Accordingly, the signal to noise S N ratio of the reproduced signal is restricted. This restriction, which is common to all frequency modulation based video signal transmission systems, including VTR s and satellite communication systems, is one of the problems to be solved for attaining high quality and greater definition. In a VHS system VTR, for example, the 600KHz or higher frequency band level is emphasized five times relative to the 120KHz or lower frequency band. In addition, signals are cut by clipping at 160 in the white direction and at 408 in the black direction distance from the peak level of the synchronizing signal to 1008 white level is taken as 100 in consideration of the frequency band of the electromagnetic transformation system.As a result, the signals obtained after the deemphasis are degraded compared with the original signals. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a signal processing apparatus which permits higher emphasis than that of the prior art, with the same frequency deviation as that of the prior art. Another object of the invention is to provide a signal processing apparatus in which the peak of the signal waveform obtained via the same emphasis as that of the prior art is substantially smaller than that of the prior art. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a signal processing apparatus which contains an arbitrary transfer function with preshoots and overshoots. A further object of the present invention is to provide a signal processing apparatus which is capable of compensating phase characteristic of transmission systems and attaining zero phase shift of processed signals in real time. According to the present invention, a signal processed in a first transmission circuit is written into a memory for a predetermined period of time and read from the memory for the subsequent predetermined period of time in a time series inverse from that for writing. The resultant signal in the inverse time series is then processed in a second transmission circuit having the same transfer function as that of the first transmission circuit. The thus processed signal contains preshoots and overshoots in its waveform. For a television signal, it is written into the memory for a period nH n positive integer H horizontal synchronization period starting at a time a arbitrary positive natural number from the leading edge of a horizontal synchronizing signal The time a is preferably located at the center of a horizontal synchronizing signal.To obtain flat frequency characteristic after emphasis or de emphasis, bilinear z transformation is preferably used to design an emphasis or a de emphasis circuit for analog todigital conversion. Furthermore, the two memories used to achieve the inverse real time series signal processing can be accessed by a common address to simplify the configuration.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a signal processing system, for explaining the principle of the present invention Fig. 2 is a block diagram showing an embodiment of signal processing apparatus of the invention Fig. 3 shows signal waveforms explaining operation of the embodiment of Fig. 2 Fig. 4 is a block diagram showing a detailed construction of the embodiment of Fig. 2 and Fig. 5 shows signal waveforms for explaining operation of the embodiment of Fig. 4.DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The principle of the present invention will now be described with reference to Fig. 1. An input signal x n is processed by a first transmission circuit 11 having a unit impulse response h n to be a signal f n . The time series of the signal f n is inverted by a time series inverting circuit 12 to be a signal a n f n . The signal a n is processed by a second transmission circuit 13 having the unit impulse response h n to be an output signal b n . Assuming that z transformations of signals x n , f n , a n and b n are X z , F z , A z and B z , respectively, and that z transformation of h n is H z , the following equations are established F z H z . X z A z F z 1 H z 1 .X z 1 l 1 B z H z A z H z H z .X z Accordingly, z transformation of the equivalent unit l impulse response for the entire system of Fig. 1, Heq z 1 , becomes as follows Heq z 1 B z X z 1 H z 1 .H z The output signal of the system of Fig. 1 has a time series inverse to that of the input signal. To obtain an output signal of the same time series as that of the input signal, another time series inverting circuit not shown may be connected to the output terminal of the system ofFig. 1. Using a Fourier transformation, the equivalent impulse response of the system of Fig. 1 is expressed as follows Heq ej H ej ê Phase shift is therefore zero. To effect a gain G for the entire system, the gain of each of the transmission circuits must be G . When an emphasis or a de emphasis is to be performed by using the system of Fig. 1, it is desirable to use a bylinear z transformation to determine transfer function.A transfer function E z for emphasis is, for example, obtained by using the following formula EMI6.1 a, b, c coefficients A transfer function D z for de emphasis with respect to the emphasis is obtained by using the following formula EMI6.2 Accordingly, by the bilinear z transformation, the product of E z and D z is precisely 1 , so that the frequency characteristic after the emphasis and de emphasis becomes flat. An embodiment of the present invention will be described below in a case for processing television signals. Fig. 2 is a block diagram of an embodiment of a signal processing apparatus of the present invention. First and second transmission circuits 11 and 13 have a same transfer function.When the apparatus is constructed as a phase linear emphasis apparatus, any well known emphasis circuits may be used as the first and second transmission circuits 11 and 13. First and second memories 15 and 16 are of the FirstIn Last Out type. Output signal of the first transmission circuit 11 is written into one of the memories 15 and 16 for a nH period n positive integer H one horizontal synchronization period . This stored signal is then read out from the memory for the following nH period in a time series inverse to that for writing, and sent to the second transmission circuit 13. That is, the time axis of the signal is reversed. The first and second memories 15 and 16 complementarily repeat the write and read operations alternately with the period of nH. Specifically, when a first switch 14 makes contact with a terminal a connected to the first memory 15 and a second switch 17 with a terminal b connected to the second memory 16, the first memory 15 conducts the write operation while the second memory 16 conducts the read operation.In contrast, when the first switch 14 makes contact with a terminal b connected to the second memory 16 and the second switch 17 with a terminal a connected to the first memory 15, the first memory 15 conducts the read operation while the second memory 16 conducts the write operation. Addresses for access to the first and the second memories 15 and 16 are generated by an address generating circuit 19. The operation described above is achieved by alternately designating the read and write operations for each of the first and second memories 15 and 16 and alternately changing over the contact terminals a, b of the first and second switches 14 and 17 by using a control signal which reverses its state with intervals of nH. This control signal is generated by a control circuit 18 from a horizontal synchronizing signal contained in a television signal. The control signal reverses at an arbitrary time a past the leading edge but between the leading and trailing edges of a horizontal synchronizing signal. Preferably, this reversing time is selected at the center of the duration of the horizontal synchronizing signal. Fig. 3shows signal waveforms at main points of the embodiment of Fig. 2 on the assumption of n 1. In Fig. 3, a is a video signal inputted to an input terminal 10.The signal a is emphasized in the first transmission circuit 11 to be a signal indicated by b . The time axis of signal b is inverted in the first or second memory 15 or 16 to be a signal indicated by c which is outputted via the second switch 17. In this embodiment, the time axis reversing time a is selected at the center point P of the horizontal synchronizing signal. At point P, signal c becomes continuous. The signal c is further emphasized in the second transmission circuit 13 to be a signal indicated by d . Since the center point P is further from both edges leading and trailing edges of the horizontal synchronizing signal, it is negligibly subjected to waveform change dupe to the emphasis processing. Accordingly, the signal d is outputted from an output terminal 20 without undesired changes.Signal e is the control signal. In the signal processing apparatus of the present invention, as described above, a signal passes through the first transmission circuit in a positive time series and then through a second transmission circuit having the same transfer function as that of the first transmission circuit in an inverted negative time series, so that the apparatus has zero phase characteristic. If the apparatus of the present invention is used as an emphasis circuit in a frequency modulation system, preshoots and overshoots are provided in the signal waveform so that the signal will not be degraded even if clipped at the same level as the prior art for example, at level S in signal d of Fig. 3 .Furthermore, if the clipped amount is the same, greater emphasis can be attained compared with the prior art, thereby increasing S N ratio. The signal processing apparatus of the present invention may contain three or more memories rather than two. The same effect as described above can be expected from such a modification. Analog memories for instance, charge transfer devices such as charge coupled devices may be used for the first and second memories 15 and 16. Alternatively, the first and second memories 15 and 16 may be digital memories each with an A D converter connected to the input terminal and a D A converter connected to the output terminal of each.Further, the signal processing apparatus of the invention may be configured such that anA D converter is incorporated before the input terminal of the first transmission circuit 11, digital memories are used as the.first and second memories 15 and 16, digital filters are used as the first and second transmission circuits 11 and 13, and a D A converter is incorporated after the second transmission circuit 13. Alternatively, the configuration may be such that an A D converter is incorporated before the. input terminal 10, digital memories are used as the first and second memories 15 and 16, nonrecursive or recursive digital filters are used as the first and second transmission circuits 11 and 13, and a D A converter is incorporated after the output terminal 19. The control circuit 18 for generating the control signal from the horizontal synchronizing signal can be easily realized using well known circuit technology. The horizontal synchronizing signal may be supplied from outside the signal processing apparatus or extracted from either the input terminal 10, the output of the first transmission circuit 11 br the input or output of the second transmission circuit 13. In the above embodiment, in which the input signal is the video signal, the time axis reverses with a period based on the horizontal synchronization period H . But, the reversing period may be set at other predetermined values according to the kind of the input signal. In the above embodiment, the invention is applied to an emphasis apparatus, but it is of course also applicable to other apparatuses such as for providing preshoots and overshoots to the input signal. Fig. 4 is a block diagram showing specific constructions of the control circuit 18 and the address generating circuit 19 of the embodiment of Fig. 2. Fig. 5 shows signal waveforms of the embodiment of Fig. 4. Referring to Fig. 4, the control circuit 18 comprises a horizontal synchronizing signal detecting circuit 30 and a control signal generating circuit 40. The address generating circuit 19 comprises an up down counter 190. The horizontal synchronizing signal generating circuit 30 comprises a differentiation circuit 31, monostable multivibrators MMs 32 and 33 and a gate circuit 34.The differentiation circuit 31 detects the edges of a horizontal synchronizing signal contained in an input video signal indicated by a in Fig. 5 , and generates a signal indicated by b in Fig. 5. The Mum 32 is triggered by a horizontal synchronizing signal leading edge detecting pulse in signal b to generate a signal indicated by c in Fig. 5. The pulse idthof signal c should be shorter than 1H but long enough to eliminate an equivalent pulse normally found at the center point of a horizontal synchro nizing signal in the vertical flyback period. The MM 33 is triggered by the leading edge of the output signal c of the MM 32 and generates a signal having almost the same pulse width as the horizontal synchronizing signal, as shown by d in Fig. 5.By respectively passing output signals c and d of the MM 32 and MM 33 through the gate circuit 34, a signal equivalent to the horizontal synchronizing signal as shown by e in Fig. 5 is obtained. Obviously, signal c does not contain the abovementioned equivalent pulse. A synchronizing signal level detector may be used in place of the differentiation circuit 31. The control signal generating circuit 40 comprises aJK flip flop JK FF 44, an a counter 42 and a D flip flop D FF 43. The JK FF 41 is set by the output e of the horizontal synchronizing signal detecting circuit 30.When the JK FF 41 is set, the a counter 42 starts counting and generates a pulse signal indicated by f in Fig. 5 after a time a . The JK FF 41 is then reset by the pulse signal f . The D FF 43 reverses its state every time it receives a pulse signal f from the a counter to generate a control signal which reverses with intervals of H as shown by g in Fig. 5. Thus, the first and second switches 14 and 17 changeover their contact terminals between terminals a and b in accordance with the control signal g . The control signal g is directly inputted to the second memory 16 at a read write designation R W terminal while it is inputted to a R W terminal of the first memory 15 via an inverter 200 first and second memories 15 and 16 thus complementarily conduct the write and read operations alternately. The up down counter 190 counts up when the control signal g is at HIGH level and counts down when the control signal g is at LOW level. The count value is supplied as common address data to the first and second memories 15 and 16. When the up down counter 190 counts up, the output signal of the first transmission circuit 11 is written through the first switch 14 into the first memory 15, while the signal previously stored in the second memory 16 is inversely read from the second memory 16 and sent through the second switch 17 to the second transmission circuit 13. In contrast, when the up down counter 190 counts down, the signal stored in the first memory 16 is inversely read from the first memory 15 and sent through the switch 17 to the second transmission circuit 13, while the output signal of the first transmission circuit 13 is written through the first switch 14 into the second memory 16. In this way the first and second memories 15 and 16 share the same address, thus simplifying circuit construction. In the embodiment of Fig. 4, the time axis inverting period is H n l . If the horizontal synchronizing signal detecting circuit 30 incorporates a counter, the time axis can be inverted at any desired period nnH .
