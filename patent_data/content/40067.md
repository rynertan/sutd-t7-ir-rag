# Strip line cable.

## Abstract
A strip line cable is provided comprising a dielectric 1 in tape form made of a porous, crystalline polymer and one or more pairs of electrical conductors such as 2a,2a each pair of conductors having a first conductor located on one side of the tape and the other conductor located on the opposite side of said tape and in substantially parallel relationship to the first conductor of the pair. The pairs of conductors are arranged in substantially parallel transverse relationship across said tape, and insulating layers 3, 3 made of a suit able non porous plastic material are placed over the conduc tors to affix them to said dielectric tape and encapsulate the cable assembly. The preferred tape dielectric is expanded, porous polytetrafluoroethylene.
