# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ELECTROLYTICALLY TREATING A METAL STRIP

## Abstract
In order to be able to selectively treat the lower or upper surface 10, 12 or both surfaces of a strip B, it is passed along a horizontal path through a chamber 304 in which lower and upper electrodes 300, 302 are located facing the surfaces 10, 12 respectively. Circuitry is provided for applying a d.c. vol tage between the strip and the electrodes. When the level of electrolyte in the chamber 304 is at a first level 330, the elec trolyte fills the space between both electrodes and covers the lower and upper surfaces 10, 12 of the strip, thus allowing electrolytic treatment of both surfaces or only one surface if one electrode does not have a potential applied to it . When the level of electrolyte is at a second level 332 the electrolyte covers at least the lower surface 10 of the strip and fills the space between the lower electrode 300 and the lower surface of the strip but not the space between the upper surface 12 of the strip and the upper electrode 302, thus allowing electroly tic treatment of only the lower surface of the strip regardless of whether the upper electrode has a potential applied to it.
