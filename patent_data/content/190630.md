## Description
The present invention relates generally to ready to stuff type food casings having sufficient moisture content that further moisture need not be added prior to stuffing. The invention especially relates to such casings which contain an antimycotic agent to prevent spoilage of the food casing prior to use. Food casings, and more particularly, sausage casings like those made of regenerated cellulose and collagen have been widely used for years in processing frankfurters, sausages, bologna, salamis, etc. Tubular casings of regenerated cellulose, for example, are manufactured by extruding viscose into a fibrous web which is then regenerated in a coagulating bath. The regenerated gel casing is washed and plasticised usually in a glycerin containing bath. The plasticized gel film is inflated and passed through lengthy gas fueled hot air dryers where the moisture content of the casing is reduced to a relatively low level, e.g. 5 to 10 percent. The dried casings may be shirred into tightly compressed strands and packaged. They may be stored for indefinite time periods or shipped to meat processing plants for stuffing at some later time. Before being used by meat processors the tubular strands or flat large size casings are customarily soaked in water to increase their moisture content usually to 30 to 55 percent on an as is basis total casing weight . The extra moisture imparts additional plasticization and flexibility to withstand high speed stuffing without tearing and permits tubular shirred strands to extend smoothly without breaking. The foregoing protocol, relating to plasticized and dried cellulosic casings, ordinarily does not present special problems with regard to preservation from molds, yeasts and bacteria developing during storage. This is true because such casings contain from 18 25 percent by weight glycerin and or propylene glycol which in addition to being plasticizers incidentally impart microbicidal properties to the casing. In addition, by maintaining relatively low moisture levels, during packaging and storage, conditions favoring germination of microbes are minimized. However, with the advent of newer automated meat processing equipment, there has been greater emphasis on stuffing operations where pre soaking procedures for casings at the meat packing plant are totally eliminated. Therefore, with greater frequency, casings are being supplied to food processors as ready to stuff shirred strands and flat reelstock, particularly where large size casings are used for salamis, bologna, meatloaves, cooked and smoked ham butts, etc. Because of the relatively high moisture levels of ready to stuff type casings, bacteria, yeasts and molds, can form on the casings during storage. Where such casings are regenerated cellulose they have been manufactured as previously described, except after addition of a plasticiser such as glycerin, the casing is dried and then remoisturized. It was not uncommon to find the practice of drying after addition of plasticizer, to allow other process steps. For instance, printing on casing sidewalls or for application of peeling aids or to reduce the moisture content to a level thought more conducive for shirring. As a final step however, much of the water previously removed by driers was then added back to the casings in order to place the casings in ready to stuff condition. Accordingly, previous ready to stuff type casings were mainly dependent on relatively high concentrations of costly chemical type plasticizers as primary plasticizers which incidentally also inhibited the development of microbes. Such high concentrations of chemical type plasticizers however, may pose a potential indirect health hazard. Those casings containing such high levels of propylene glycol, glycerin and other similar type materials may in some instances diffuse from the casing sidewall into the surface of the encased meat product after stuffing. The level of antimycotic agent present although relatively high, would not prevent spoilage throughout the packaged meat product, but could mask visual evidence of meat spoilage and deterioration typically manifested by the appearance of sliming, souring or greening formation on the surface. Accordingly, such high levels of polyols added to food casings primarily as plasticizers may block the natural indicators of food spoilage which are necessary for consumer safety. Premoisturized, ready to stuff type casings relying on high levels of chemical type preservatives and primary plasticizers are described in the following patents U.S. 3,617,312 discloses a polymeric water insoluble overcoating for dry sausage casings containing an antimycotic agent which slowly leaches from the overcoating after the casing is stuffed with meat emulsion. These casings were not premoisturized and packaged and required an additional water insoluble polymer such as a polyester or polyacrylic. Furthermore, the antimycotic agent was primarily in the overcoating rather than throughout the casing. The antimycotic agents incorporated into the water insoluble polymer could include, among many others, lower alkyl esters of p hydroxybenzoic acid. U.S. 3,864,499 discloses conventional dried casings treated with a high percentage of glycerin plasticizer. The glycerin containing casings, which are soaked prior to stuffing, are treated with additional oil soluble antimycotic agents, e.g. alkyl eaters of p hydroxybenzoic acid, dispersed in a viscose composition containing colloidal sized droplets of oil and organic cosolvents. The colloidal sized oil droplets prevent removal of the additional antimycotic agent during soaking prior to stuffing. U.S. 3,981,046 relates to the humidification of cellulosic food casings carried out by the application to the interior of such casings of an aqueous solution containing at least 25 percent chemical type plasticizer. The plasticizers included various polyols, such as glycerin, propylene glycol, PEG and the like, the amount of glycerin present being suitable to plasticize the casing. The plasticizers also operate to retard imbibition of water by the casing. U.K. Patent Specification 1,593,996 describes premoisturized large size tubular food casings containing from 25 to 71 percent moisture based on total weight of dry cellulose in the casing, wherein the casings also contain from 25 to 40 percent glycerin based on dry weight of cellulose present and an even higher percent glycerin when based on weight of liquid in the casing. In addition to glycerin, other antimycotic agents are suggested to prevent mold and fungi growth. U.K. Patent Specification 1,584,435 discloses a premoisturized food casing, the propylene glycol or polyol content of which is at least 20 percent by weight of liquid and an antimycotic agent is preferably contained in amounts of at least 2,5 percent by weight of liquid in the casing. UK Application 2,071,988 also relates to preparation of premoisturized casings having up to 40 percent water based on total casing weight. In order to control the development of molds, etc., the water activity of the casing is controlled by means of various chloride salts, e.g. sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, ammoninm chloride, etc., preferably when used in combination with another antimycotic agent, as for example, propylene glycol. Glycerol may also be added to the casing. U.S. Patent 4,409,251, like that of U.K. Application 2,071,988 controls the development of mold, yeast and bacteria prior to stuffing by maintaining the water activity of the casing at a sufficiently low level in conjunction with a glycerin content in the casing of at least about 40 weight percent based on the total weight of dry cellulose in the casing and again even a greater percent glycerin when based on liquid in the casing. German Patent Publication P 29 26 590 5 discloses high moisture casings which are sterilized by heat and stored in sterile packages. Such heating is energy intensive and is therefore undesirable. In addition the heating of such casings to sterilization temperatures can adversely affect the properties of the casing. The preserved, premoisturized casings disclosed above require high temperature sterilization or else require relatively high levels of polyols as plasticizer, and therefore, requirements for water as the primary plasticizer are reduced. Besides relying on glycerin, propylene glycol and other costly polyols for microbicidal and plasticizing properties, ready to stuff casings in many of the above instances are dried in energy intensive dryers or else require high temperature sterilization. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved ambient temperature preserved, premoisturized ready to stuff type sausage casing which can be stored indefinitely without developing molds, yeasts or bacteria wherein water performs as the sole or principal plasticizer. The object of the present invention is a method of preserving novel premoisturized ready to stuff food casings. Ready to stuff as used herein means having sufficient moisture to permit stuffing prior to shipment to the meat packing plant. Such ready to stuff casings contain at least 40 percent and preferably at least 55 percent water by dry weight of casing. The invention is related to a method of preserving ready to stuff food casing at the time of packing with sufficient moisture to permit stuffing, which comprises incorporating from 0 to less than 15 percent of polyol plasticizer and from a few ppm to less than 5000 ppm of the antimycotic agent both by weight of liquid in the casing, said antimycotic agent being effective throughout a pH range of 5 to 9 at a concentration of less than 2000 ppm by weight of liquid in the casing. Preferably less than 10 percent polyol by weight of liquid in the casing are incorporated. Humidification and plasticization are achieved by means of the water taken up by the casing during manufacture, thus, substantially, eliminating or reducing the requirement for conventional chemical type plasticizers, e.g. glycerin, propylene glycol and other food grade polyols. The casings are preserved to inhibit development of molds, yeasts, and bacteria allowing storage for indefinite time periods. The premoisturized casings rely on water as the primary plasticizer, and in some instances the sole plasticizer, in combination with minor amounts of a high pH active antimycotic agent as a preservative. The combination provides important benefits in terms of conservation of energy. That is, energy requirements customarily expended in drying food casings can be substantially reduced or even eliminated. Further economic benefits are also realized as a result of reduced requirements for more costly chemical type plasticizers, e.g. glycerin and other polyols. The invention includes preserved, high moisture unreinforced and fibrous reinforced gel type casings, such as flat stock for large type stuffed meat products, like bolognas, and for use in conjunction with automatic stuffers etc. In the case of gel type premoisturized casings, all drying requirements may optionally be eliminated. The invention also includes such casings in prepackaged form. The present invention generally relates to premoisturized food casings, their methods of manufacture and more particularly, to ready to stuff meat or sausage casings prepared with sufficient moisture as to be readily stuffed with a food product without further moisture being added beforehand by the food processor. The casings are preserved with a sufficient amount of a high pH active non polyol antimycotic agent, preferably an alkyl ester of p hydroxybenzoic acid, to prevent the development of molds, and desirably other microorganisms such as yeasts and bacteria, even during prolonged periods of storage. The fibrous and non fibrous reinforced ready to stuff casings of the present invention may be used for meat and sausage products like frankfurters, bologna, salami, deli loaves, turkey rolls, hams, etc. Unlike conventional sausage casings supplied to meat processors in shirred strands and in relatively short flattened tubular lengths, which must first be soaked in water prior to stuffing, casings of the present invention contain sufficient moisture that soaking or other moisture addition processes need not be performed by food processors before stuffing. Thus, for purposes of the present invention, such expressions as premoisturized and ready to stuff are intended to mean food casings having sufficient water that food processors may omit the customary step of soaking the casings just prior to stuffing. The moisture content of the casings is usually at least 40 percent by weight based on dry weight of casing. In most instances, the casings will be plasticized with from about 40 to about 240 percent by weight based on dry weight of casing. More preferably, the water content will range from about 55 to about 170 percent by weight based on dry casing. Unlike other premoisturized ready to stuff casings, those of the present invention do not rely on polyols like glycerin and propylene glycol as plasticizers, nor as preservatives. The present invention contemplates embodiments whereby requirements for polyols for plasticizing and preserving casings can be dramatically reduced and even totally eliminated. Instead, the premoisturized casings are plasticized with higher levels of water, such as previously described and other high pH active antimycotic agents are used instead of polyols. This is a rather significant departure from prior art premoisturized and preserved casings, such as described in U.S. Patent 4,409,251, where ready to stuff type casings have at least 40 weight percent glycerin based on total weight of dry cellulose in the casing. British Patent Specification 1,584,435 actually describes the need for substantially greater amounts of polyol for the particular level of water used which imparts the desired flexibility and stuffing characteristics to the casing. Thus, it was surprising to find that high moisture levels can be maintained without accompanying higher levels of propylene glycol, glycerin and the like. Accordingly, the higher water levels of the subject casings not only provide economic benefits in terms of raw materials, but it was also found that the performance of the casing per se in terms of feed characteristics in stuffing equipment is also improved in many instances over other premoisturized, ready to stuff casings prepared with lower water contents and higher polyol loadings. According to the method of the present invention the water imbibed by the casing during washing will plasticize the casing and the prior art need for adding on polyol or drying the casings subsequently and then remoisturizing can be eliminated at significant cost savings. In accordance with the present invention it has been surprisingly found that the casings can be preserved by adding on controlled amounts of high pH active antimycotic agents with little or no polyol. Examples of such antmycotic agents are 1,2 benzisothiazolin 3 one 1,2 dibromo 2,4 dicyanobutane natamycin and the alkyl esters of p hydroxybenzoic acid. Antimycotic agents commonly used in the prior art which are free acids or acid salts are generally not effective throughout the pH range of 5 to 9. Preferred antimycotic agents used according to the invention are the lower alkyl C₁ C₇ esters of p hydroxybenzoic acid. The antimycotic agent may be applied to the wet casing from an aqueous medium. The applied antimycotic agent may be on the surface or enter the casing. In either case the agent is considered to be incorporated into the casing . In the case of alkyl esters of p hydroxybenzoic acid the solution is usually substantially saturated with the ester with or without the benefit of accompanying surfactants or cosolvents. The objective, in either case, is to incorporate amounts of antimycotic agent into the casing sufficient to inhibit the development of molds and desirably also bacteria and yeasts during storage of the casing without altering normal shelf life of the meat product after the casing is stuffed. In most instances, the antimycotic agent should be free or substantially free of acid groups or acid salts. Antimycotic agents active in a pH range of 5 to 9 are desirable because in accordance with the present invention, it has been found that storing casing at a low pH, e.g. below 5 is deleterious to the casing. Propionic and sorbic acids, for instance, at low pH over a period of time, i.e...during storage and shipment, may have a deleterious affect on the casing material resulting in a weakening and loss of wet strength, etc. and in addition are usually not high pH active. Furthermore, it has been found in accordance with the present invention that even if the casing is stored at a low pH, the pH tends to rise with time, possibly due to the reactivity of the OH groups in the cellulose and starches from which many such casings are made. When the pH rises to pH 5 to 9, many common antimycotics tried in the prior art become ineffective, especially those antimycotics which have a high molecular weight percent of acid groups. Effective antimycotic agent compounds for use in the present invention usually contain less than 10 molecular weight percent acid groups, i.e. they are essentially free of such groups. The concentration of antimycotic agent may be 50 ppm or lower, by weight of liquid in the casing. However, for the alkyl p hydroxybenzoates the preferred range is from 100 to 1500 ppm, especially 100 to 1100 ppm, and more optimally, from about 200 to about 500 ppm. At such concentrations the casings can be scored and shipped over extended time periods without the development of microorganisms. Concentrations as high as 2000 ppm 0.2 may be used. Even higher concentrations may be employed, but without added benefit, and there may be an added risk of diffusion into the meat product after stuffing which may mask the natural formation of slime or greening normally observed with deterioration and spoilage of meat products. In the case of alkyl p hydroxybenzoates, the effectiveness of the casings in resisting development of microorganisms may be influenced by the solubility of the particular ester in the treating bath from which it is applied. That is, the solubility of the alkyl esters of p hydroxybenzoic acid in water is limited, e.g. 400 ppm at 25 In some instances, it was found that aqueous treating solutions containing propyl p hydroxybenzoate prepared at room temperature did not appear to provide adequate microbicidal activity for the casing. Hence, the present invention contemplates the use of saturated solutions heated above ambient temperature conditions, i.e...above 25 C. For example, propyl p hydroxybenzoate may be utilized in water where the solubility of the easter at 40 C increases to about 640 ppm. After the moisturized casings are treated in aqueous solutions of propyl p hydroxybenzoate at elevated temperatures and cooled, some of the antimycotic agent imbided may crystalize in situ and provide for continuous saturation of the liquid phase of the casing and protect the casing against development of microbes. Accordingly, such casings may be plasticized only with water and preserved with partially dispersed and partially dissolved alkyl p hydroxybenzoate. The requirement for using heated saturated aqueous solutions for other lower alkyl esters, e.g. methyl and ethyl, may be omitted due to their more favorable solubility characteristics. As an alternative preferred embodiment, it is sometimes advantageous to first dissolve the antimycotic agent in a cosolvent. Dissolution of certain lower alkyl esters of p hydroxybenzoic acid, e.g., propyl p hydroxybenzoate in an alcoholic cosolvent can improve overall microbicidal activity. For example, only 0.04 grams of propyl p hydroxybenzoate will dissolve in water 100 grams at 25 The casings contemplated herein are tubular food casings in the form of flat reelstock or individual shirred strands, and more particularly, fibrous reinforced and non fibrous reinforced meat casings. Typically, casings are formed from cellulose, cellulose ethers, esters, collagen, polyvinyl alcohol, amylose, high amylose starches, to name but a few. For example, casings prepared from regenerated cellulose, cellulose ethers, etc., can be made by processes such as the cuprammonium process, by denitration of cellulose nitrate, and preferably by the viscose process . According to one embodiment of the present invention, a fibrous web consisting of cellulosic fibers, hemp, rayon, sisal or other fibrous materials may be coated with viscose by extrusion methods using known techniques. The coated web is then coagulated to effect regeneration of the cellulose by passing the extruded material into an aqueous bath containing, for example, sodium sulfate and sulfuric acid. The coagulation liquid is applied to convert the cellulose xanthate to cellulose. The regenerated casing is then washed in water to purify and remove chemicals to form a gel type casing having a high moisture content. The casing is then treated in the bath containing the antimycotic agent, as previously described, to preserve the casing. The casings prepared according to the forgoing method can be stored over prolonged time periods and supplied as flat reelstock to meat processors. The high moisture gel type casings in the form of flat reelstock provide very smooth performance, for instance, in modern integrated shirr stuff and clip type meat processing equipment without the need for further soaking prior to stuffing. Such machines perform the steps of first gathering or loosely shirring the ready to stuff casing on a stuffing horn which is subsequently indexed to a stuffing position. The casing is then filled with a meat emulsion and closed by means of an automatic clipping or twisting mechanism. The casings of the present invention may operate smoothly in the equipment described in U.S. Patent 4,358,873. Pre shirred strands of ready to stuff casings are also intended within the context of the present invention. Where a higher density shirring is desired, obviously further drying of the casing will be required in which case some glycerin can be added by conventional means to aid in plasticizing the casing and to avoid possible damage as a result of pinholing. Drying and the addition of glycerin may also be desirable in those instances where, for example, high temperature meat release or peeling aids are coated onto interior walls of casings to avoid removing meat with the casing when stripped by consumers. Drying may also be required in those instances where direct printing onto the finished casing is desired. It should be noted, however, that alternative type low temperature peeling aids, such as carboxy methyl cellulose may be substituted in place of high temperature release agents thereby avoiding the need for drying. Similarly, drying can also be eliminated by use of printed outer packaging jackets for the stuffed meat products in place of direct printed casings. Alternatively, the fibrous web may be imprinted prior to coating with viscose. Likewise, drying and the addition of glycerin can be eliminated in most instances because flat reelstock is more desirable than high density shirred tubular casings for most ready to stuff applications. Furthermore the invention relates to a method of making ready to stuff storable food casings having sufficient moisture so that no additional moisture is required prior to stuffing which comprises forming a polymer film into a length of tubular material, regenerating said tubular material in a coagulating bath, washing, plasticizing and preserving by incorporating from 0 to less 15 percent polyol and from a few ppm to less 5000 ppm of an antimycotic agent both by weight of liquid in the casing, said antimycotic agent being effective throughout a pH range of 5 to 9 at a concentration of less than 2000 ppm by weight of liquid in the casing, and packaging said tubular material. Preferably the same antimycotic, amounts threof, moisture contents and polyol contents as mentioned above are used. Finally the invention is directed to a packaged meat product comprising a tubular food casing and a meat containing product stuffed therein wherein said casing is a fibrous reinforced material having a pre stuffing moisture content which will permit stuffing without further moisture being added thereto prior to stuffing, said casing comprising from 0 to less than 15 percent polyol and from a few ppm to less than 5000 ppm of an antimycotic agent both by weight of liquid in the casing, said antimycotic agent being effective throughout a pH range of a 5 to 9 at a concentration of less than 2000 ppm by weight of liquid in the casing. Preferably the packaged meat product is stuffed in a cellulosic casing having a pre stuffing moisture content ranging from about 55 to 170 weight percent water based on weight of the dry weight of fibrous material and the antimycotic agent is an alkyl ester of p hydroxybenzoic acid present in an amount from about 200 to about 500 ppm. A clear synthetic small diameter fibrous sausage casing is prepared by forming a long fiber hemp paper into a continuous tube which is passed through an annular die where a viscose dope consisting of cellulose xanthate dissolved in caustic soda is coated on both the inner and outer sidewalls saturating the web with a matrix. The saturated fibrous tube is then regenerated in an aqueous coagulating bath containing sulfuric acid, ammonium sulfate and sodium sulfate, and rinsed in a series of aqueous wash tanks to remove chemical impurities. Instead of plasticizing in glycerin or adding propylene glycol, the casing is immersed in an aqueous preservative bath saturated with 1500 ppm of propyl paraben. The bath temperature is between 65 and 70 Three 80 foot strands, prepared above, are inoculated with at least 5 x 10⁴ spores of each of the following genera molds Premoisturized, ready to stuff fibrous cellulosic sausage casing is prepared following the procedure of Example I except the preservative bath is prepared with 900 ppm propyl paraben containing 85 percent water and 15 percent propylene glycol as a cosolvent. The propyl paraben is first dissolved in the propylene glycol and then added to the water. The bath temperature is maintained at 60 Generally, fibrous casing under good practice handling conditions will have a spare contamination on the casing surface of less than one half spare per square inch. Accordingly, the spore loading conditions of Examples I and II far exceed those encountered under typical packing house conditions. Large diameter gel type regenerated cellulose casing is prepared by the well known viscose process. Instead of plasticizing in an aqueous glycerin bath and drying the casing after being washed in a water bath, the casing is treated in a preservative bath at 60
