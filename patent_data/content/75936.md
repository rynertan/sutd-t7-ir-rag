## Description
PRODUCTION OF MONOETHYLNE GLYCOL MONOMETHYL ETHER, MONOETHYLENE GLYCOL AND ETHANOL FROM HYDROGENOLYSIS OF POLYALKYLENE GLYCOLS Brief Summary of the InventionTechnical Field This invention is directed to the production of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol by the hydrogenolysis of a polyalkylene glycol, e.g. diethylene glycol. The polyalkylene glycol is selectively cleaved at a carbon to oxygen covalent bond and independently at a carbon to carbon covalent bond by heating with molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst containing nickel to produce at least one of monoethylene.glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol. Monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether can be produced in predominant amounts by employing the process of this Invention1 i.e., the selectivity of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether may approach about 95 molar percent.Background Art It is known that monoethylene glycol is commercially produced by the hydrolysis of ethylene oxide which in turn is generated by the oxidation of ethylene1 typically by the reaction of ethylene and oxygen over a silver containing catalyst. Other processes noncommercial for making monoethylene glycol involve reactions of carbon monoxide with hydrogen or formaldehyde, typically in the presence of a certain precious metal catalyst. Major by products of the commercial oxide glycol process are diethylene glycol and higher polyalkylene glycols in amounts up to 10 percent by weight of the total product mixture. However, diethylene glycol may or may not be a commercially desirable by product. For instance, considerably more diethylene glycol by product may be produced from the commercial oxide glycol process than can be utilized profitably.In those instances where the production of di ethylene glycol is commercially undesirable, any process capable of efficiently converting this by product to monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol, ethanol or other valuable products would be highly desirable. It has been found as a result of the present invention that polyalkylene glycols, e.g., diethylene glycol, can be selectively cleaved at a carbon to oxygen covalent bond and independently at a carbon to carbon covalent bond by heating the polyalkylene glycol with molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst containing nickel to efficiently produce at least one of monethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol.

However, none of these references and no prior art is currently known to us which discloses or teaches a process for selectively cleaving a polyalkylene glycol at a carbon to oxygen covalent bond and independently at a carbon to carbon covalent bond by heating with molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst containing nickel to produce at least one of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol.Disclosure of Invention The present invention provides a process for selectively cleaving a polyalkylene glycol, e.gt, diethylene glycol, containing at leastone ether group therein at a carbon to oxygen covalent bond and independently at a carbon to carbon covalent bond by heating the polyalkylene glycol with molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst comprising nickel to produce at least one of monoethylene glycols monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol.Monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether can be produced in predominant amounts by employing the process of this invention, i.e., the selectivity of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether may approach about 95 molar percent. In copending U.S. Patent Application SerialNo. D 13,231 filed on an even date herewith, there is described the manufacture of monoethylene glycol and ethanol by the hydrogenolysis of a polyalkylene glycol, e.g., diethylene glycol. The polyalkylene glycol is cleaved at a carbon to oxygen covalent bond by heating with molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst, e.g., copper chromite, to produce at least one of monoethylene glycol and ethanol. The selectivity of the monoethylene glycol and ethanol may approach or exceed 95 molar percent using copper chromite as the hydrogenation catalyst. It has been surprisingly found as a result of the present invention that when a composition containing nickel is used as the hydrogenation catalyst in a process for hydrogenolyzing polyalkylene glycols, both monoethylene glycol and ethanol are produced and, additionally, monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether is produced in a selectivity which may approach 95 molar percent. Accordingly, it is readily apparent that either monoethyl ene glycol monomethyl ether monoethylene glycol ethanol or monoethylene glycol ethanol may be selectively produced by similar hydrogenolysis processes utilizing either a hydrogenation catalyst containing nickel or a hydrogenation catalyst such as copper chromite respectively. The selectivity of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether in the present invention and the selectivity of monoethylene glycol ethanol in copending U.S.Patent ApplicationSerial No. 0 13,231 may each approach 95 molar percent. Copending U.S. Patent Application SerialNo. D 13,341 , filed on an even date herewith, describes a process for selectively cleaving a polyalkylene glycol, e.g., diethylene glycol, at a carbon to oxygen covalent bond and independently at a carbon to carbon covalent bond by heating with molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst comprising ruthenium to produce at least one of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol.The production rate of each of said monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol is at least about 10 moles kilogram ruthenium hour. Copending U.S. Patent Application SerialNo. D 13,342 , filed on an even date herewith, describes a process for selectively cleaving a polyalkylene glycol, e.g. diethylene glycol, at a carbon to oxygen covalent bond and independently at a carbon to carbon covalent bond by heating with molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst comprising iridium to produce at least one of monoethylene glycol monoethyT ether, monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol. Monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether can be produced in significant amounts by employing the process disclosed in this copending application. Detailed Description Hydrogenolysis of polyalkylene glycols may proceed according to different cleavage pathways.For example, as illustrated. in the present invention, polyalkylene glycols may be cleaved at a carbon to oxygen covalent bond and independently at a carbon to carbon covalent bond to give different products. The cleavage pathways are influenced or varied, to a certain extent, by choice of hydrogenation catalyst, concentration of active metal in hydrogenation catalyst, pressure provided by molecular hydrogen and other factors. When a hydrogenation catalyst containing nickel is used in the hydrogenolysis of a polyalkylene glycol, e.g., diethylene glycol, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the cleavage pathway is predominantly directed toward a carbon to carbon covalent bond resulting in the production of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether in predominant amounts.A lesser proportion of cleavage is directed toward a carbon to oxygen covalent bond resulting in the production of both monoethylene glycol and ethanol In lesser amounts.As the most preferred embodiment of the present Invent Ion, the hydrogenation catalyst may contain at least about 65 percent by weight nickel to obtain desirable amounts of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol, i.e., the selectivity of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether may approach about 95 molar percent. The preferred hydrogenation catalysts which can be used to catalyze the hydrogenolysis process of this invention are well known in the art and include compositions containing nickel. The preferred hydrogenation catalysts may also include, as an additional ingredient, a promoter or promoters for increasing the activity of the hydrogenation catalysts. Suitable catalyst promoters may include barium, calcium magnesium, manganese, strontium, zirconium, titanium, hafnium, potassium, lithium, sodium, rubidium, cesium, molybdenum, chromium, tungsten, zinc and the like. Certain metals such as copper, chromium, molybdenum, tungsten, iron, cobalt, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, platinum, iridium, rhenium, tantalum, vanadium, niobium, zinc and the like may act as co catalysts in combination with nickel. It is noted that molybdenum, chromium, tungsten and zinc may act as either a co catalyst or promoter . Reference to the hydrogenation catalysts, promoters and co catalytts as containing the above described metals is meant to include the metal in the compound form as well as the elemental form, for example as a metal oxide or sulfide or as a metal hydride, or as the reduced elemental metal or as mixtures of the foregoing. The hydrogenation catalysts may be employed in the presence or absence of a catalyst support. Suitable catalyst supports include silica gel, aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide, titanium dioxide, magnesium aluminate, zirconium dioxide, silicon carbide, ceramic, pumice, carbon, diatomaceous earth, kieselguhr and the like.Illustrative of the preferred hydrogenation catalysts useful in the process of this invention include compositions containing at least about 10 percent by weight nickel on a suitable catalyst support, e.g., nickel on silica gel, nickel on kieselguhr and the like. The compositions containing oxides may be totally or partially reduced in situ during reactor heat up. The most preferred hydrogenation catalysts of this invention include compositions containing at least about 65 percent by weight nickel on a suitable catalyst support. Many of the above described hydrogenation catalysts are commercially available and others are prepared by known methods detailed hereinbelow. The hydrogenation catalysts useful in the process of this invention can be employed in any form. They may be present in the reaction mixture as finely divided powders, porous tablets, pellets, spheres, granules and the like. It is desirable that the hydrogenation catalysts possess a high surface area. The preferred surface area ranges from about 0.5 mê gm to about 300 mê gm and even greater. Most preferably, the surface area of the hydrogenation catalysts ranges from about 10 mê gm to about 300 m2 gm. The average pore diameter of the hydrogenation catalysts is not narrowly critical. Hydrogen diffusion appears to be rate limiting in catalysts having very small pores.It appears that a very small average pore diameter and or a large catalysts particle diameter are detrimental to high monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether monoethylene glycol ethanol selectivities and or polyalkylene glycol conversion rates. In general, for obtaining desirable monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether monoethylene glycol ethanolselectivities, it is believed that catalysts having nl nm an average pore diameter of at least about 150 A preferably at le about 250 C 25 nm, preeraoiy at ieast about z3u A , ana a particle diameter of less than 10 millimeters, preferably 5 millimeters or even less, are useful in the hydrogenolysis process of this invention. The quantity of the hydrogenation catalysts which is employed is not narrowly critical and can vary over a wide range. In general, the process of this invention is desirably conducted either continuously or batchwise in the presence of a catalytically effective quantity of the hydrogenation catalysts which gives a suitable and reasonable reaction rate, e.g., from about 1 to about 100 moles kilogram catalyst hour. The reaction proceeds when one employs as little as about .01 weight percent, or even a lesser amount of catalyst based on the total quantity of the reaction mixture under batch conditions. The upper concentration of the hydrogenation catalyst can be quite high, e.g., about 50 weight percent of catalyst based on the total quantity of reaction mixture. Higher concentrations may be used if desired.However, the upper concentration appears to be dictated by economics in terms of the cost of certain hydrogenation catalysts to achieve the given reaction and by ease of handling of the reaction mixture during the course of the reaction. Depending on various factors, such as the total operative pressure of the system, the operative temperature and other considerations, a concentration of between about 0.1 and about 30 weight percent hydrogenation catalyst based on the total quantity of the reaction mixture is generally suitable in the practice of this invention. The preferred polyalkylene glycols which can be used in the practice of the process of this invention are well known in the art and include diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol and the like. In the most preferred embodiment of this invention, diethylene glycol formed as a by product of the commercial oxide glycol process described hereinabove, is selectively cleaved at a carbon to oxygen covalent bond and independently at a carbon to carbon covalent bond by heating with molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst containing nickel to produce at least one of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol.By utilizing the preferred catalysts and reaction conditions of the present invention, higher polyalkylene glycols such as triethylene glycol and tetraethylene glycol may be selectively cleaved to give at least one of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol. These polyalkylene glycols are prepared by methods well known in the art. The relative amounts of polyalkylene glycol and molecular hydrogen which are initially present in the reaction mixture can be varied over a wide range. In general, the molar ratio of molecular hydrogen to polyalkylene glycol is in the range of between about 1 20 and about 2000 1, preferably between about 1 2 and about 500 1 and most preferably, between 1 1 and about 200 1. It is to be understood, however, that molar ratios outside the stated broad range may be employed. However, very high molecular hydrogen to polyal kyleneg1yco1 molar ratios are economically unattractive, and very low molecular hydrogen to polyalkylene glycol molar ratios will result generally in low conversions and lower product selectivities.When operating in the continuous mode, molecular hydrogen and polyalkylene glycol may be fed either concurrently or countercurrently over the hydrogenation catalyst using either upward, downward or horizontal flow with concurrent downward flow being preferred. The gas hourly space velocity GHSV of molecular hydrogen and the liquid hourly space velocity LHSV of polyalkylene glycol may be varied over a wide range utilizing the continuous process. The gas hourly space velocity of molecular hydrogen may range from about 100 hr 1 or less to greater than 100,000 hr 1, preferably from about 1,00 hr 1 to about 100,000 hr 1, and most preferably from about 2,000 her 1 to about 75,000 her 1. The liquid hourly space velocity of polyalkylene glycol may range from about0.Ol hr 1 or less to about 100 hr 1 or greater, preferably from about 0.1 hr 1 to about 25 hr 1, and most preferably from about 0.25 her 1 to about 10 her 1 The higher GHSV and LHSV values generally tend to result in uneconomically low conversion of polyalkylene glycol, and the lower GHSV and LHSV values generally tend to decrease the selectivity of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol. The intended purpose is to provide a sufficient quantity of polyalkylene glycol and molecular hydrogen in the reaction mixture to effect the desired production of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol. The process of this invention can be effected over a wide temperature range. In general, the process is conducted at a temperature of between about 1250C and about 3500C. Lower temperatures generally give improved product selectivity, but often at economically unfavorable rates. Higher temperatures generally increase total productivity but tend to increase by product formation.Operating the process at temperatures lower than 1250C will not produce t.he desired products at optimum rate so that the reaction will typically be operated over an extended period of time and or excessive quantities of catalyst must be employed in order to obtain the desired production of reaction products at reasonable rates. When operating the process at temperatures higher than 3500C there is a tendency for the organic materials contained in the reaction mixture to decompose. In most cases when operating at the lower end of the temperature range, it is desirable to utilize pressures in the higher end of the pressure range. The preferred temperature range is between about 150 C and 3000C, while the most preferred temperature range is between about 175 C and 2650C.However, there are occasions when a preferred temperature range may include any of the more desirable ranges as well as the broadest range such that the process may be operated at a temperature of between 1500C and 3000C as well as between about 1250C and 3250C. The process of the present invention is effected under atmospheric or superatmospheric pressure conditions. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the pressure is produced almost exclusively by the molecular hydrogen provided to the reaction. However, suitable inert gaseous diluents may also be employed if desired.Actual operating pressures initial pressures under batch operating conditionst of between about 690 bar atmospheric and about 10,000 psig represent an operative limit for producing the monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol products. The preferred actual operating pressure conditions for the production of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and, ethanol ranee from about 100 psig to I Dar i72i about 4000 PSiq and. most preferably, from about 250 138 bar psig to about 2000 psig.When operating the process at lower pressures, the rate of reaction becomes slower and therefore the reaction period must be extended until the desired amount of reaction products are produced When operating the process at higher pressures, the rate of production of the desired products will generally be increased.Higher pressures generally tend to increase the selectivity to monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, but very high pressures can also increase by product formation through secondary hydrogenolysis reactions.Lower pressures generally tend to increase the selectivity of monoethylene glycol and ethanol, increase the formation of by products such as 2 oxodioxane and decrease the selectivity of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether. The process of this invention is effected for a period of time sufficient to produce the desired monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol products. In general, the reaction time can vary from a fraction of a second to several hours, i.e., from 0.1 second and shorter to approximately 10 hours, and longer.If more sluggish reaction conditions are selected, then the reaction time will have to be extended until the desired products are produced. It is readily appreciated that the required residence period, i.e., reaction time, will be influenced by reaction temperature, concentration and choice of hydrogenation catalyst1 total pressure, concentration molar ratio of polyalkylene glycol and molecular hydrogen and other factors. When operating the hydrogenolysis process of this invention under continuous conditions, the reaction time or residence period may generally range from a fraction of a second to several minutes or more whereas the residence period under batch conditions may generally range from a few minutes to several hours.The synthesis of the desired products from the hydrogenolysis of a polyalkylene glycol is suitably conducted under operative conditions which give reasonable reaction rates and or conversions. The process of this invention can be carried out in a batch, semi continuous or continuous manner in either a liquid phase, vapor phase or a combination iquid vapor phase. The reaction may be conducted in fixed bed, slurry phase, trickle bed or fluidized bed reactors or the like using a single reaction zone or in a plurality of reaction zones, in series or in parallel. The reaction may be conducted intermittently or continuously in an elongated tubular zone or a series of such zones. The material of construction of the equipment should be such so as to be inert during the reaction. The equipment should also be able to withstand the reaction temperatures and pressures. The reaction zone can be fitted with internal and or external heat exchangers to control undue temperature fluctuations caused by the moderate exothermic nature of the reaction.In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, agitation means to ensure complete mixing of the reaction mixture should be used in reaction systems not employing a fixed bed catalyst. Mixing induced by magnetic stirrer, vibration, shaker, rotating, sparging with gas, oscillation, etc. are all illustrative of the types of agitation means which are contemplated herein. Such agitation means are available and well known to the art. The polyalkylene glycol, molecular hydrogen and hydrogenation catalyst ingredients may be initially introduced Into the reaction zone batchwise. Alternatively, the polyalkylene glycol, molecular hydrogen and hydrogenation catalyst ingredients may be introduced into the reaction zone continuously or intermittently during the course of the synthesis reac tion. Means to introduce the ingredients into the reaction zone during the course of the reaction and or means to adjust the ingredients in the reaction zone during the reaction, either intermittently or continuously, can be conveniently utilized in the process to maintain the desired molar ratios of ingredients and to maintain the pressure exerted by hydrogen. The operative conditions of the present process may be adjusted to optimize the selectivities and conversion rates of the desired products and or the economics of the process. For example, it may generally be preferred to operate at relatively low conversion rates, which tends to increase selectivities of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol due to reduced by product formation. Lower conversions also tend to increase the monoethylene glycol ethanol molar ratio by reducing secondary hydrogenolysis of monoethylene glycol. Recovery of the desired monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol can be achieved by methods well known in the art, such as by disttllation, fractionation, extraction, and the like.Typically, in carrying out the process, the product contained in the reaction mixture would be withdrawn from the reaction zone and distilled to recover the desired products. For reactors not employing a fixed bed catalyst, a fraction comprising the hydrogenation catalyst and by products can be removed for recovery or regeneration of the catalyst. Fresh hydrogenation catalyst can be intermittently added to the reaction stream or it can be added directly to the reaction zone, to replenish any catalyst which is lost in the process. Although this invention has been described with respect to a number of details, it is not intended that this invention should be limited thereby. The examples which follow are intended solely to illustrate the embodiments of this invention which to date have been determined and are not intended in any way to limit the scope and the intent of this invention.

Prior to each of the examples the magnetic stirrer was disassmebled and all components washed thoroughly to remove residual catalyst powder. All parts and internals of the reactor were similarly cleaned, rinsed with acetone and dried.The reactor was charged with a mixture of 50 grams of diethylene glycol and 1 gram of a finely pulverized catalyst specifically identified for each example in Table I below. The reactor was charged with only 25 grams of diethylene glycol in Example 9 and with 100 grams of diethylene glycol in Examples 7, 8, 10, 11 and Q4 bThe reactor was then sealed, purged twice with shad psig of molecular hydrogen and, after pressure testing, charged with an initial amount of molecular hydrogen. The initial molecular hydrogen pressure for each example is given in Table I. The magnetic stirrer was started and adjusted to 1000 rpm, and the reaction system was then heated to a temperature specified for each example in Table I.After a six hour reaction period the reactor was cooled, stirring was discontinued and the pressure vented slowly. The reaction period was only four hours for Examples 1, 2, and 3. During the venting step, a sample of product gas was collected for analysis by gas chromatography. The remaining liquid contents of the reactor were then removed, weighed and analyzed by gas chromatography. The performance of catalysts tested in Examples 1 through 18 is given in Table I.

Examples T through 18 illustrate the overall effectiveness of compositions containing nickel as the hydrogenation catalyst of this Invent Ion. A composition containing at least about 10 percent by weight nickel is the prefered hydrogenation catalyst for use in the hydrogenolysis process of this invention. When a composition containing at least about 65 percent by weight nickel is used as the hydrogenation catalyst, the selectivity of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether may approach 95 molar percent see Example 9 in addition to the co production of monoethylene glycol and ethanol in lesser amounts.Example 11 shows that the rate of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether formation from diethylene glycol was greater than 36 molelkg cat hr and the combined rate of monoethylene glycol and ethanol formation from di ethylene glycol was greater than 9 moles kg cat hr. See also Example 3 showing a rate of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether formation from diethylene glycol of greater than 30 moles kg cat hr and a combined rate of monoethylene glycol and ethanol formation from diethylene glycol of greater than 14 moles kg cat hr. These rates are sufficiently high to be commercially desirable.Nickel has the further advantage of being relatively inexpensive and commercially available from a number of suppliers in a variety of formulations. Examples Through 11 illustrate the effect of pressure on the hydrogenolysis reaction using the same hydrogenation catalyst, i.e., Catalyst III, and the same temperature, i.e., 2500C. As can be seen from Examples 9 and 10, a pressure of about 1000 psig is preferred for obtaining overall desirable performance. The most preferred pressure for production of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, mqnoethlyene glycol and ethanol ranges from about 34.5 500 psig to about 2000 psig. Examples 7 through 14 illustrate the effect of temperature on the hydrogenolysis reaction using the same hydrogenation catalyst, i.e., CatalystIII. As can be seen from Examples 9 and 10, a temperature of about 2500C. is preferred for obtaining overall desirable performance. The most preferred temperature for production of monoethylene glycol monoethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol range from about 175 C to about 2500C. Examples 1 though 6 illustrate the effectiveness of other hydrogenation catalysts commercially available containing different concentrations of nickel, i.e., Catalysts I, II and IV, utilized in the hydrogenolysis process of this invention. Examples 15 through 18 illustrate the use of hydrogenation catalysts, i.e. Catalysts V throughVII, containing 10 percent by weight nickel. As can he seen from these examples, at least one of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether, monoethylene glycol and ethanol is produced using a hydrogenation catalyst containing the preferred 10 percent by weight nickel. It is noted that monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether is produced in predominant amounts when Catalysts V through VII see Examples 15 through 13 are used as the hydrogenation catalyst in the processs of this invention. EXAMPLES 19 THROUGH 21Examoles 19 throuqh 21 were conducted under mm continuous conditions in a inch outside diameter 406 mm by 16 inch stainless steel tube reactor t35 milliliters volume which was coaxially fitted with a 1.5 millimeter diameter stainles steel sheathed thermocouple In accordance with the following procedure. A 5 gram charge of catalyst, specifically identified for each example in Table II below, was dispersed in an equal volume of glass helices and placed in the stainless steel ttrbe reactor with beds of glass helices occupying the space above and below the charged catalyst. The catalyst was then reduced in the stainless steel tube reactor by heating to 1500C under flowing nitrogen.Molecular hydrogen was introduced and adjusted to a concentration of about 10 volume percent. The temperature and. the molecular hydrogen concentration were then increased incrementally over a. 48 hour period until the temperature reached 2500C and the reducing atmosphere was 100 volume percent molecular hydrogen. The pressure was then raised 09. bar from ambient to 1000 psig for 30 minutes prior to cooling to the desired operating temperature. After reduction, the temperature and molecular hydrogen flow rate were adjusted to their desired levels.Diethylene glycol and molecular hydrogen were premixed at 2750C in a preheater filled with glass helices and of dimensions identical to that of the stainless steel tube reactor. The reactants were then passed downward over the catalyst bed at conditions of temperature, pressure, gas and liquid flow rates gas hourly space velocity and liquid hourly space velocity as indicated in Table 11. The products were condensed and collected at reactor pressure. The liquid products and uncondensed gases were sampled periodIcally and analyzed by gas chromatography. Unconverted molecular hydrogen was not recycled. The performance of catalysts tested in Examples 19 through 21 is given in Table II.

Examples 19 through 21 illustrate the overall effectiveness of the present invention when employing a continuous process. A composition containing at least about 65 percent by weight nickel is the most preferred hydrogenation catalyst for use in the continuous process of this invention.The selectivity of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether in Example 21 was 85 molar percent using a composition containing 65 percent by weight nickel as the hydrogenation catalyst in the continuous process. The rate of monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether formation resulting from the continuous process is also sufficiently high to be commercially desirable see especially Example 21 .Examples 19 through 21 illustrate a desirable temperature range, pressure range, gas hourly space velocity range and liquid hourly space velocity range which may be employed in the continuous process. Temperatures ranging from about 1750C to about 265 C and 438 ying from about 175 0 40 about 209 0 and 138 pressures ranging from about 1000 psig to about 2000 psig are most preferred for obtaining high monoethylene glycol monomethyl ether selectivities and rates in addition to the production in lesser amounts of monoethylene glycol and ethanol. The gas hourly space velocity GHSV and liquid hourly space velocity LHSV may be varied over a wide range utilizing the continuous process. Gas hourly space velocities of from about 2,000 hr 1 to about 75,000 h r I and liquid hourly space velocities of from about25 her 1 to about 10 hr 1 are most preferred for obtaining desirable selectivities and rates
