# WIRE CUTTING DISCHARGE PROCESSING MACHINE.

## Abstract
A wire cutting discharge processing machine, in which a workpiece W is discharge processed by an electrode wire 18 moving between upper and lower wire guides having a cooling liquid supply passage 62 . This machine is provided with a throttle valve 68 , which is set in a flow passage 66 branching from a main electrode wire cooling flow passage 64 communicated with the cooling liquid supply passage 62 , and which is adapted to regulate the cross sectional area of the flow passage in accordance with the pressure of the cooling liquid flowing from the cooling liquid supply passage 62 thereinto. The cooling liquid passed through the throttle valve 68 is distributed around an electrode pin 42 in the wire guides to cool the same.
