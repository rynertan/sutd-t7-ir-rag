# Cycle derailleur.

## Abstract
A derailleur for use with a multi stage sprocket assembly of a cycle, said derailleur comprising a fixing member 1 and a derailleur body having a parallelogram linkage comprising a support member 2 , a pair of link members 3, 4 each pivot ally connected to said support member 2 and 20 a movable member 5 , which mounts a chain shift means 14 , said derailleur body including a return spring 27 arranged for biasing said movable member 5 unidirectionally, said derail leur body being pivotally mounted 6 on said fixing member 1 via said support member 2 , said chain shift means 14 being pivotally movable relative to said movable member 5 , which along with the chain shift means 14 has a tension spring 31 disposed for acting therebetween and biasing said derailleur body counterclockwise relative to said fixing member 1 , one of the members 3 to 5 of the derailleur body having a control wire W secured thereto, so that displace ment thereof will transform the parallelogram linkage against the basing force of said return spring 31 and swing said derailleur body relative to said fixing member 1 against the biasing force of said tension spring 27 . According to this invention there is provided a step wise feed means 21, 23 disposed for acting between said fixing member 1 and said derailleur body, said feed means 21, 23 being operable, in use, by said wire W to swing said derail leur body step wise in correspondence with speed changes between different sprockets of said multi stage sprocket assembly, relative to said fixing member 1 and to subse quently transform said derailleur body, when changing from one speed to another corresponding to shifting of the drive chain from a higher speed sprocket to a lower speed sprocket of the multi stage sprocket assembly in use of the derailleur.
