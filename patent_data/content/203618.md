## Description
The present invention relates to benzoylurea derivatives having insecticide activity and, more precisely, relates to 1 benzoyl 3 aryl urea derivatives which are particularly active against insect larvae and eggs, noxious in agrarian and civil field and in the use of such derivatives. Furthermore, the invention relates to the process of synthesis of these ureas. Several 1 benzoyl 3 aryl urea derivatives endowed with insecticide activity are known, among them, Diflubenzuron, usual appellative of the compound 1 2,6 difluoro benzoyl 3 4 chlorophenyl urea, specified in US A 3 933 908 U.S. Philips Corporation . Diflubenzuron, however, is suspected of being a cancerogen European Chem.News In DE A 32 35 419 and in Chemical Abstracts, Vol. 102, no. 23, abstract no. 203 749y substituted N p aminophenyl N benzoyl ureas and N 2 chloro or 2,6 difluorobenzoyl N 3,5 dichloro 4 alkoxyalkoxyphenyl ureas are described which are endowed with insecticidal activity. In the aforesaid definitions, the term halogen is meant preferably as a fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom. The compounds having formula I are endowed with insecticide activity and are fit for use in agrarian, forestal, civil and veterinary field, in the fight against insect infestations. In the specification of the preparation of the compounds having formula 1 reported hereinafter, symbols R,R₁, R₂, R₃, R₄, R₅, R₆, Z and Y have the meaning reported in formula 1 unless otherwise specified. The compounds having formula 1 are obtained by reaction between a benzoyl isocyanate having formula Aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorine hydrocarbons, ethers,ketones and aceto nitrile are suitable solvents. The benzoyl isocyanates having formula II are known compounds, in some cases they may be found on the market. Amines having formula III may require a specific preparation. In particular, amines having formula III may be prepared according to known methods, for instance The ethers having formula IV may be prepared according to the known method specified, for instance, in J. Am. Chem. oc. As appears obvious to the skilled technician, different alternative procedures may be used for the synthesis of the intermediates and of the products having formula I . An alternative procedure for the synthesis of the compounds having formula I consists, for instance, in reacting a benzamide having formula Such reaction is carried out under conditions similar to those specified hereinbefore for the reaction between the benzoyl isocyanate having formula II and the amine having formula III . The preparation of the isocyanates having formula XI foresees, however, the preparation of amines having formula III and their reaction with phosogene. This aspect together with the consideration that the benzoyl isocyantes having formula II are available as much as the amides having formula X are available, leads to the general preferance of the synthesis method mentioned hereinbefore, namely the reaction between the compounds having formula II and III . As above mentioned, the compounds having formula I are endowed with a high insecticide activity which shows chiefly against insect larvae and eggs. Amongst these, the ones belonging to the Lepidoptera, Dipthera and Coleoptera orders may be particularly fought by means of the compounds having formula I . These orders comprise a great many species, important for their noxiousness in agrarian, forestal, civil and veterinary field. Therefore, the compounds having formula I are fit for various uses, namely, for instance, the defense of agricultural cultivations against phytophagous insect infestations, the protection of environments against mosquitoes and flies, the protection of breeding cattle against some cattle parasites etc. Furthermore, the compounds having formula I show a collateral acaricide activity. For practical uses, the compounds having general formula I may be utilized as such or, more conveniently, in the form of compositions containing other than one or more of the compounds having formula I as active constituent, inert solid or liquid carriers and, optionally, other additives. According to the usual formulative practice, the compositions may be in the form of wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, etc. The amount of active constitute in the compositions varies within wide ranges 1 95 in weight depending on the type of composition and the use to which such composition is allotted. Whensoever particular situations so require, or in order to enlarge the action spectrum, other active substances such as, for instance, other insecticides or acaricides may be added to the compositions. The amount of active substances compound having formula I to be distributed for the insecticide treatment, depends on various factors such as, for instance, the type and degree of infestation, the environment in which infestation is had agrarian cultivation, basins or water courses, organic substrata of varied nature , the type of employed composition, climatic and environmental factors, available application means, etc. Generally, amounts of active substances ranging between 0,01 and 1 kg ha are sufficient for a good disinfestation. The following examples are given in order to better illustrate the invention Preparation of N 2,6 difluorobenzoyl N 3,5 dichloro 4 1,1,2 trifluoro 2 perfluoroethoxy ethoxy phenylurea compound n.1 Then 0,7 g of 2,6 difluorobenzoylisocyanate, suspended in 10 ml of anhydrous tetrahydrofurane are dripped at room temperature. The mixture is kept under stirring for 60 minutes, then cooled and filtered. The precipitate is concentrated under reduced pressure and the product is separated for filtering. 1,28 g of benzoylurea is obtained having a melting point of 128 130 C. Starting from the anilines specified in subsequent example 3 and operating under conditions similar to those specified in example 1, the following compounds have been prepared, using 2,6 difluorobenzoylisocyanate Preparation of the intermediate anilines. 32,5 miilimoles of 2,6 dichloro 4 aminophenol , dissolved in 20 ml of anhydrous dioxane, are introduced under nitrogen into a 2 necked flask having a 50 ml capacity and equipped with cooler, magnetic stirrer and thermometer. At room temperature, 8,12 millimoles of metallic sodium or hydrosodium are added, and stirring is effected at room temperature until the formation of sodium salt is had. Under nitrogen atmosphere, the mass is transferred into a second flask being 3 necked and having a 100 ml capacity and equipped with ethanol dried ice cooler and magnetic stirrer, and dilution is effected with 20 ml of anhydrous DMF. Cooling is effected at 30 C and 32,5 millimoles of the suitable vinylalkylether IV in a sole portion and without solvents are added. The mass is left overnight to return to room temperature whilst stirring. Finally, the mass is poured into a solution of 10 soda, extracted with ethylether and purified for column chromatography, recuperating the phenol not converted. Using CF₂ CF 0CF₂CF₃ such as vinylether, 4g of 3,5 dichloro 4 1,1 ,2 trifluoro 2 perfluoroethoxy ethoxy aniline have been obtained with a conversion of 30 . ¹H NMR 6 ,6 s, 2H, arom. 6,4 5,8 dt. 1H, CHF 3,8 sb, 2H, NH₂ Using CF₂ CF 0CF₃ such as vinylether, 5g of 3,5 dichloro 4 1,1,2 trifluoromethoxy ethoxy anilene has been obtained with a conversion of 46 . ¹N NMR 6,65 s, 2H, arom 6,15 5,95 dt, 1H, CHF 4,2 sb, 2H, NH₂ By operating under conditions similar to those described hereinbefore but using the 4 aminophenol and CF₂ CFOCF₂CF₃ such as vinylether, 8g of 4 1,1,2 trifluoro 2 perfluoroethoxy ethoxy aniline have been obtained with a conversion of 71 . ¹H NMR 6,95 6,55 dd, 4H, arom. 6,15 5,9 dt. 1H, Testing of the insecticide activity. Residual immediate activity on larvae of At a distance of ten days after the infestation and after having renewed at least once the treated substratum, a computation was made of the dead larvae with respect to the comparison treatment. Activity on larvae of Spring water 297 ml was mixed with an acetonic solution 3 ml of the product under examination in a suitable concentration. 25 Dipter larvae, being 4 days of age, suitable fed, were introduced into the obtained solution. Other larvae were introduced for comparison purposes into a water acetone solution 3 ml acetone, 197 spring water without any active product. Every 2 3 days, note was taken of the dead larvae and pupae and of the adults normally emerged from the cocoon, till the emergment from the cocoon of the insects in the comparison solution was over. The activity of the product under examination was expressed as a percent ratio of dead individuals compared with the total number of treated individuals. The insecticide activity in the above mentioned tests was expressed according to the following scale of values. In the following table 1, the insecticide activity data in the intended doses are reported, expressed through the above scale of values.
