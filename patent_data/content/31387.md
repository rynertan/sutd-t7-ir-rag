# Method and apparatus for rotating a workpiece at a constant peripheral speed at a cutting face.

## Abstract
A method of constantly controlling the peripheral speed of a workpiece turned and cut by a lathe or the like, whereby the peripheral speed of the workpiece is held constant. Before a cutting tool is positioned at its cutting point by a quick fee command, the rotational speed n of a spindle is calculated according to the following formula on the basis of the distance x between the cutting point and the center of the spindle, and a command peripheral speed V n V 2 nx, the spindle being driven to rotate at the calculated rotatio nal speed. When the cutting tool thus reaches the cutting point, the actual peripheral speed of the spindle becomes equal to the command peripheral speed or its approximate value.
