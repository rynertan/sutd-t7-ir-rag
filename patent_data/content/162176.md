# Fabric rewind system.

## Abstract
The invention is an improved system for rewinding fab ric, particularly such fabrics which are more or less imper vious and tend to entrap air between successive layers of the fabric being wrapped upon a core means as the rewinding proceeds. The system may be operated in a horizontal rolling mode or in a vertical rolling mode. When operating in the horizontal mode the system utilizes the weight of the supply roll 52 to directly maintain more or less air free layers, al ternatively a minimum mechanical pressure is maintained at the supply roll in the horizontal mode as the weight of the supply roll diminishes near the end of the supply. When op erating in the vertical mode, the pressure means is reversed, utilizing a constant mechanical pressure of the roll, or rolls, being wrapped against the supply roll 72 as the rewinding proceeds. This direct pressure system to maintain more or less air free layers eliminates the tedious and time consum ing threading of the fabric over and under a complicated system of a plurality of idler rolls, drive roll, rider roll, and a core.
