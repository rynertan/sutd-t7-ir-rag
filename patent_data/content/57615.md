# AIR VENT ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
A unique air vent is provided for use with heat recover able closures when installed on pressurized cables. Typi cally, when a heat recoverable closure is used to repair a hole or opening in the jacket of a pressurized cable the cable must be depressurized during installation of the clo sure to ensure formation of a pressure and watertight seal. The air vent assembly permits installation of a heat recover able closure without the need for depressurizing the cable. After installation, the air vent can be used as an access point to the pressurized air within the cable.
