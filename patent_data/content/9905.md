# A base for a bed.

## Abstract
A base for a bed comprising preferably two or four light weight thermoplastics platforms 1,2,3,4 interlocked together by couplings which engage skirts 126,42b and lugs 44b depending from the platforms so as to prevent rotation of one platform relative to another. The platforms are easily separated for transport by a vertical lifting force yet they resist separation by unintentional rotational forces caused by sitting on or lifting their peripheral edges.
