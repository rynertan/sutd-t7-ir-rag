# Container finish for resealing with pt closure.

## Abstract
This relates to glass container neck finishes which are particularly configurated to use solely with PT closures 20 which are provided with liners 30 formed of a suitable compound and wherein the closures are pressed onto the container neck finishes 38 , and removed therefrom by a twisting action. The neck finishes 38 are particularly configurated to facilitate the re engagement of the closures with the neck finishes by twisting actions so as to assure both the interlocking of the closures with the neck finishes and the resealing of the containers.
