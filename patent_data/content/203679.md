# Herbicidal sulfonamides.

## Abstract
Compounds of the formula CHEM wherein W is O or S Q is an aromatic tricyclic group R is H or CH3 and A is a mono or bicyclic heterocyclic group, e. g. pyrimidyl or triazinyl and their agriculturally suitable salts, exhibit herbicidal activity. Some also exhibit a plant growth regulant effect. The novel compounds may be made by a variety of synthetic routes, e. g. by reacting an appropriate sulfonyl isocyanate or isothiocyanate with an appropriate heterocyclic amine.
