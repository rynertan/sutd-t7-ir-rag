# UNSUPPORTED VANADIUM OXIDE CATALYST CONTAINING CHROMIUM OXIDE, ITS PREPARATION AND ITS USE IN THE VAPOR PHASE OXIDATION OF LOWER ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS

## Abstract
The present invention provides an unsupported vanadium oxide catalyst containing chromium oxide, its preparation and its use in the vapor phase oxidation of lower aliphatic hydrocarbons. The catalyst with superior crush strength for the use in said reaction for the high yield conversion of said hydrocarbons such as n butane to corresponding monocarboxylic acids such as acetic acid is prepared by the reduction of a vanadium oxide containing chromium catalyst. The catalyst is an unsupported one in that the vanadium oxide is a reduced vanadium oxide in which the vanadium ions have a valence less than five. The catalyst contains from about 1 to about 60 mole percent chromium oxide calculated as chromium III oxide.
