# Ceramic capacitor.

## Abstract
A ceramic chip capacitor comprises electrically conduc tive layers 1a, 1b, 1c extending alternately to two edges 2a, 2b of a ceramic body 2 . Two other edges 2c, 2d are provided with electrical terminations 3c, 3d . The edges to which the conductive layers extend are each partially coated with a thin fusible metallic film 3a, 3b which connects the layers extending to that edge to a respective one of the it terminations. The fusible films isolate the capacitor from associated circuitry if the capacitor fails and effects an internal short circuit.
