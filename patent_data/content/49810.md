# Hydrogen peroxide synthesis.

## Abstract
This invention relates to improvements in palladium carbon catalysts for the production of hydrogen peroxide from a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in the presence of an aqueous liquid capable of inhibiting the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. The improvement comprises pretreating the catalyst with an aldehyde or ketone, and, preferably, also pretreating the catalyst with a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid. Improved catalysts are obtained by reducing a soluble palladium compound deposited on a high surface area non graphitic carbon base, in the form of a dried powder, with hydrogen at 27 200 C.
