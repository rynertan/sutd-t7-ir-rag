# Improvements relating to closures.

## Abstract
A moulded plastics closure for a container having a screw threaded neck has a top 11 and a depending skirt 12 with an internal screw thread ridge 13. A sealing rib 14 projects radially inward from the skirt above the ridge 13. The central area of the top 11 is in the form of a well, the bottom wall 25 of which is concavely curved. The side wall 26 of the well and a downward extension 30 thereof provide an out wardly projecting rib 28. The top of the neck of the container is received between ribs 14 and 28 which form seals with the external and internal surfaces of the neck. Additional ribs 20 project into sealing contact with the top end of the neck.
