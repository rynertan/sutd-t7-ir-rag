## Description
The present invention relates to a signal processor for digital radar echo signals as defined in the precharacterising clause of the claim. Such a processor is known from the paper by Hansen et al. on pages 211 218 of Record of the IEEE 1980 International Radar Conference, IEEE Publication 80CH 1493 6AES. By the article Ein adaptiver Filter zur Unterdrückung von Radarstörungen mit unbekanntem Spektrum of Bühring and Klemm in Frequenz 30 1976 , pages 238 to 243, a similar digital processor is known which can suppress clutter disturbances and enhance useful signals of given Doppler frequency. It includes an estimator of disturbance parameters and a weight synthesizer for calculating the complex weights of a transversal filter. The filter coefficients are calculated in a microprocessor. The present invention relates to the field of radars, and more exactly to that of radar signal processing for disturbance suppression. The signal processor can approximate the principle of operation of the optimum processor, which is the processor which maximizes the signal to noise ratio. It is furthermore capable of suppressing, in an adaptive way, clutter having an approximatively Gaussian power spectrum. Its performance is better than that of an adaptive MTI MTIA followed by a coherent integrator. The device may be inserted within an integrated radar signal digital processor, between the analogue to digital converter and the modulus extractor. The specific tasks of the device disturbance suppression and useful signal enhancement , are obtained in an adaptive manner as far as disturbance and useful signal to be detected parameter variations are concerned. This adaptiveness provides a way to overcome the limitations related to fixed disturbance filtering, while optimizing, at the same time, system capability to detect useful targets. Signal processors, which are presently implemented by means of digital circuitry, receive at their input the radar video signal which is detected coherently and converted into digital format. They provide as an output an indication of targets which may be present detection process by attenuating undesirable signals. The elimination of undesirable signals arising out of reflections caused by natural or artificial obstacles clutter , is obtained in current radar technique by means of MTI filtering Moving Target Indicator described in many articles and books, among which A further example in this area can be found in the adaptive MTI device This latter device implements the function of a normal MTI filter over clutter disturbance caused by moving obstacles by means of an estimate of the disturbance Doppler phase. The limits, in performance terms, of the processors mentioned above are as follows The limits presented above are overcome by the present invention, as explained in the following. The filter profile is automatically shaped by the device exploiting three different types of information The first two informations are automatically computed by the device through a phase estimator and correlation which will be presented in the following. The third information is provided to the device s input and is meant to set the finite impulse response FIR filter further downstream so that it enhances the Doppler frequency band in which we expect to receive the useful signal. Based on this information, the filter is shaped so as to attenuate the frequency bands in which clutter is present and to enhance that in which the useful signal is expected. The method which is adapted to synthesize the FIR filter weights, and therefore its frequency response, is such as to guarantee the utmost exploitation of the pulses to be processed, both in terms of clutter suppression and of signal integration. The method which is used to derive the best suited filter profile is based upon the theory of optimum radar signal processing when surrounded by a disturbing environment, which is profusely described in Reference will now be made to the theory to better illustrate the characteristics of the processing device of the present invention. Let us consider a train of N where X Samples are separated by T seconds, where T is the radar repetition period. These samples are combined linearly by a FIR filter, with N Let us now, for convenience, indicate in vector notation the N where T indicates the transpose of the vector on which it is applied. The FIR filter 10 , performs a linear combination of samples X where u is the filter output signal. The frequency response of the FIR filter depends solely on weights 2 , so that we have to act upon them to obtain a given filtering capability. Having indicated with By estimating the value of the correlation coefficient of the input signal samples, we may call up from the memory the elements of the corresponding matrix This way we can solve the problem of inverting a matrix of N 2 C elements using a memory, which is low cost hardware, and a series of multipliers, as will be shown in the following. The present invention will now be described with reference to forms of implementation which are presently preferred and are reported as an illustration on the basis of figures and drawings attached, where Figure 1 shows a known FIR filter Figure 2 shows the complex multiplier block 1 of Fig. 1 Figure 3 shows the functional diagram of the suppressor, and is the most significant figure Figure 4 shows the block diagram of the estimator Figure 5, in particular, shows the weight shaper block 8 of figure 3 Figure 6 shows in particular the phase generator block 26 in figure 5 . Figure 7 shows a bank of Doppler filters which are obtained by a parallel of NF parametric suppressors, each of which is tuned to a given frequency of the useful signal. As we have already said, Figure 1 shows a FIR filter in its most general configuration. Here the complex multiplier 1, the delay element 2 and the data adder 3 appear at the output of the complex multiplier. For greater clarity, Figure 2 shows, in a schematic way, the complex multiplier in Fig. 1. The same FIR filter may also be obtained using a recursive structure in such case there would be the need for one delay element, one complex multiplier and a storing adder. Figure 3 shows, within dotted lines, a functional diagram of the suppressor. Ouside the dotted lines, there is the schematic of a memory which contains samples X A number N of trains B of samples of signals received by the same number of range cells adjacent to the one from which the train to be processed is extracted, is sent to a clutter correlation coefficient and phase In a memory 5 are stored N covariance matrices of clutter having average Doppler frequency equal to zero N is also the number of distinct values or ρ which the estimator may provide at the output. The estimated valueρ and of the correlation coefficient selects a precise area C of memory 5, which contains a table, coinciding with In the weight shaper 8 enter To further clarify the operation of the device presented, in the following we shall proceed with a detailed description of the devices which make up the invention. By definition of correlation coefficient 14 we have where the over bar and the letter E stand both for the operation of statistic average the sign over letter indicates, on the contrary, that 11 gives way to a complex number the modulus of which is the correlation coefficient ρ, and phased The statistic average may be approximated by an arithmetic average over N independent samples taken from N adjacent range cells see Figure 3 Figure 4 shown in detail device 4 of Figure 3 which implements equations 13 , 14 , 15 . In particular one can discern the calculated values through which 13 may be rewritten as Through a coherent limiter, which divides complex number Within this memory we can find Nρ areas, each one of which contains the elements of the covariance matrix of the disturbance for Estimator 4 provides an estimated valueρ and and the memory selector 5 addresses the area relevant to the value of ρ which is closest to the one provided by the estimator. The numbers stored in the area selected are then dumped into a buffer 6 for further insertion into block 8. Figure 5 shows in greater detail the device which calculates and from 10 where From buffer 6, we can extract line by line of matrix This W Phase generator 26 is used to precalculate coefficients 19 starting from input e Figure 6 shows the functional schematic of this generator it is based upon the recursive relation Coefficients α₁, α₂, α₃.... α The suppressor which is presented herein may also be used in a Doppler filter bank to cover the range of unambiguous Doppler frequencies, so as to detect useful signals f unknown Doppler frequency.
