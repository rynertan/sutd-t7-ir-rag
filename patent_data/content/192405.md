# Nuclear fuel claddings.

## Abstract
A nuclear fuel cladding having a burnable absorber integrally incorporated therein has an outer tubular layer of a zirconium alloy an intermediate layer, of a thickness less than the outer tubular layer, of a zirconium alloy containing a boron containing burnable absorber and an inner layer, of a thickness less than the intermediate layer, of zirconium metal. The layers are bonded together to form a cladding for the containment of nuclear fuel.
