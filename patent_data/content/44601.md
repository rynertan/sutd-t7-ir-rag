## Description
Composition for the discharge printing of textile materials and process for printing textile materials.The present invention relates to a composition for the discharge printing of textile materials, more particularly polyester, triacetate, acetate and a mixture of said textile materials with natural fibresDischarge printing is widely adapted for applying colored patterns on textile materials, whereby a first dye is applied to a layer of textile material followed, on this first dye, by a composition thut contains a substance which breaks down the first dye present. When a composition is worked which only contains the chemical substance which decomposes the first dye, white or uncoloured parts are obtained on the textile material.When the unprinted composition with the discharging agent contains not only the discharging agent but also additionally a dye that is proof against the discharging agent, another second colour is obtained at the place where the composition is applied. This method of printing textile materials is relatively complicated, since light prints are difficult to see on a dark background, so that matching difficulties may occur. The more that heavier qualities are used, the greater the risk of the position of the contours of small motifs being unclear and diffuse on the large background.The cause of this is the high pressure that must be set on a printing machine in order to obtain any effective penetration of the print into the textile material.The production process of discharge printing of textile materials is achieved by a so called two stage method and proceeds as follows.The dischargeable base c lours are dyed, sized or preprinted and then dried, after which the textile material is printed with the aid of a rotary, screen, roller or litho printing machine while applying the compostition containing a discharging agent which may additionally contain dyes which are proof against the agent. The whole is then dried, fixed and further treated.With this known process, use is generally made of stannousII chloride as discharging agent, but other metal compounds may also very easily be used, such as e.g. zinc formaldehydesul foxylate. The concentration of the discharging compound to be used is relatively high 100 g per kg of discharging agentcontaining composition or more owing to the lack of the mechanical effect cover print and the hydrophobic nature of artificial fibres.The application of a high concentration of discharging agent presents the disadvantage that a a small dying range is obtained since, the more reducing agent is used, the less the dyes become dischargeproof. In practice, this results in dis charge proof dyes which are relatively dull in colour.b When the dyes are fixed on the textile material, hydrochloric acid escapes during this reaction mechanism which gives rise to high corrosion and attack of the metal of the steamer in which the fixation takes place.c Stannous chloride is an expensive product so that the process is very costly.The two stage method as applied has the disadvantage in particular, that a high percentage of waste occurs, which is a consequence of the fact that the process is difficult to check and when the first dye applied is dried, certain ports may be fixed so that the discharge print fails when the composition containing the discharging agent is printed on the first dye. Furthermore, the opportunities for design and artistic work are restricted since the print with the compostion containing the discharging agent and the first dye cannot be printed to match in relation to each other, while, finally, this procescan virtually be applied only on thin polyester materials. Having regard to the above disadvontoges of the twostage method, processes hove been sought in which, during printing, the first dye is applied in one stage together with the print of the composition con.tsininge the discharging agent. By this means, the following advantages are obtained.a The textile material need be passed over a printing machine once only, while drying after applying the first dye containing composition can be omitted this leads to major economic advantages.b Since the drying of the first colour containing composition is superfluous, no additional problems can resvlt with parts of the textile material containing dye already fixed, so that the percentage of waste is reduced.c The composition containing the first dye and a discharging compound can be printed in relation to each other so that the opportunities for design and artistic work are much greater. In porticular, this process allows designs hitherto impossible to be printed onto textile materials.d Through an appreciably smaller use of stannous II chloride important economic odvanteges are obtained.e Owing to the fact that less stonnous II chloride need be used, less corrosion of the installation is also likely.f A more extensive range of dyes can be worked with as more dyes will be proof to the discharging agent owing to the smaller quantities of the latter, so that the opportunity of printing light tints is also gained. g Single stage printing allows thicker, coarser polyester qualities to be worked with.h A multi coloured design can be obtained by making use of masks both in the stencils for the first colour and the stencils for applying the compound containing the discharging agent, which may contain a second colour which is proof against the discharging compound.It will be clear that a very great number of possibilities of colour patterns can be achieved by including dischargeable and discharge resistant dyes in the composition for applying the first dye. With these single stage methods known hitherto, use is made of a first dye containing composition on to which a second composition is applied which contains a thickener, in addition to e.g. zinc formoldehydesulfoxylute, also known as Decroline . The difficulty that arises with this process is that a relotively large quantity of decroline must be used which has a detrimental effect on the colour pattern or design eventually obtained. It is a primary object of the invention to provide a composition for the discharge printing of textile materials, preferably in a single stage, by applying a discharging agent whereby the above disadvantages do not arise and, in particular, improved colour patterns can be obtained with an appreciable saving in raw materials. The opportunity is also created for discharging textile materials without stannous Il chloride, depending on the dyes and materials to be processed. This is attained according to the invention by a composition for discharge printing textile materials, which does not coagulate with the composition and a discharging agent, characterized in that the composition contains as discharging agent, at least one organic composition exerting a reducing effect on organic dyes.The composition may effectively include an organic compound exerting a reducing effect with the formulaR1R2C X or R1R2C XH where X is a sulphur or selenium atom, the group R1 an amino group whether substituted or not and the group R2 consists of an amino group if there is a double bond between the carbon atom and the X atom or consists of an imino group if there is no double bond between the carbon atom and the X atom.The composition preferably contains an additional discharging agent in the form of a salt of a metal of the second to fourth groups of the periodic system. However, this is unnecessary if suitable recipes are applied.The composition may with particular advantage contain as a discharging agent a halogen compound of a bivalent metal, in particular zinc chloride, and yet more advantageously a halogen compound of a quadrivalent metal, in particular stonnium, which stannium compound is applied in the form of stannous II chloride.The thickeners applied in the compost ion according tio the invention may effectively consist of cellulose or starch derivatives thickening with water. Other solvents can also be included in the composition such as e.g. benzine, in which case semi emulsions are obtained. A composition may effectively be used for printing which contains 0,1 to 4 of a metal salt, more particularly 0,1 to 2 and 0,5 to 10 organic discharging agent, still more particularly 1 to 5 and more effectively 0,5 to 1 of a metal salt, preferably t stannous II chloride and or 0,5 to 5 thiourea.The composition according to the invention is particularly used for rotation film printing of textile materials containing synthetic and natural fibers, particularly cellulose fibers cotton and polyester.The invention will now be explained with the aid of several examples. aExample IDischarging composition for e.g. dispersed dyes 360 g of thickener 12 solution is mixed with 40 g of emulsifier 12,5 solution , 16 g of sodium acetate and 2 g of citric acid and 48 g of thiourea.Further, 10 g of carrier and 320 ml of terpentol are added to this composition, together with a desired quantity of discharge proof dispersed dyes and 20 to 40 g of stannous II chloride depending on the properties and concentrations present of the dischargeable dyes or those to be discharged . This is filled up to 1000 g with water or another solvent.Example IIDischarging composition suitable for e.g. dispersed dyesThe composition described in Example I is prepared but without 20 40 g stannous II chloride. Instead of stannous II chloride 30 g of Solutionsalz or an identical product and 30 g of Lyogene V or an identical product is added. It is filled up to 1000 g with water.Example III Discharging compost ion suitable for dispersed reuctive dyesThe composition described in examples I or II is taken but the quantity of citric acid is increased to 50 g and 80 g of polyethyleneglycol specific weight 300 is also added, after which discharging on to polyester cotton is possible.Example IVDischarging composition suitable for pigment dyes a 700 g of an acid pigment cover printing paste is taken, to which is added 20 g of sodium acetate, 20 g of fixation agent, 50 g of tylose MH 300 7 solution , 50 g of citric acid and 50 g of thiourea. A certain quantity of dischargeresistant pigment dye and 20 40 g of stannous II chloride depending on the properties and dye concentrations present of dischargeable dyes or dyes to be discharged is further added to this composition. It is filled up to 1000 g with water. By means of this printing paste cover printing is possible on polyester cotton with discharge resistant pigment dyes.Example VDischarge composition suitable for pigment dyesThe composition described in Example IV is taken but without 20 40 g of stannous II chloride and, instead, the products named in Example II are added. Example VIPrinting of textileA layer of one of the discharge resistant printing pastes as described in one of the examples I to V is applied to the textile material to be printed 50 cotton fibre and 50 polyester fibre and a print overlayer is applied to this of a known printing paste with dischargeable dyes.Both printing pastes are printed wet on wet in a single stage with the aid of a printing machine.The cloth is then dried, fixed at e.g. a temperature of 170 0C within a period of e.g. 10 minutes, after which the textile material is further treated.It is recommended that the printing paste according to the invention be first applied to the textile material and then the paste with dischargeable dye, as this produces optimum results.
