## Description
The invention relates to a valve of original design applicable to apparatus of a medical type and particularly to intravenous infusion and transfusion equipment, as also for parental feeding. As is known, in medical applications of the type refer red to, i.e. intravenous infusions and transfusions, valves are required to control the flowrate of the liquid being administered, which valves require to have a number of specific features. In the first place, they must be capable of a fine adjustment, adjusting the flowrate supplied between limits with very low fluctua tions, namely, the flow rate must be stable. Further more, they must be very cheap to manufacture to allow the generalised use of such valves in intravenous in fusion and transfusion equipment, whereby they may be more frequently changed, since it is less costly for the application of new products in the medical treat ment or even for their frequent disposal. Furthermore, this type of valve must allow for being sterilised, both singly and when integrated in the corresponding equipment. These features are achieved by the valve of the present invention, said valve having original func tional and constructional features. Essentially, the valve of the present invent tion is based on the principle of adjusting the amount of liquid flowing along a tube by varying the size of the cylindrical annulus between the inner walls of the tube and a cylindrical core, which may be solid or not, having constant dimensions and being positioned in the interior of the said tube, adjusting the effective inside diameter of the tube containing the inner core, such that the liquid flow may be precisely varied. To obtain such variation, the present invention relies on the outer tube, within which the cylindrical core is positioned, being a tube of rubber, silicone, plastics or other material having resilient properties, namely, that it may recover its original dimensions after hav ing been subjected to tensile, compression or other stresses, so that when an axial pull is applied there to, the diameter of the tube is reduced both externally and internally, with the clearance between the inner walls of the tube and the outer walls or surface of the constant diameter internal cylindrical core reducing progressively. In this way the effective passage of the liquid flowing inside the flexible tube is varied. To attain its object, the present invention is based on the flexible outer tube having recovery properties al lowing the outer tubular member to recover its original diameter when the axial pull or compression thereon is relieved. To produce the longitudinal pull on the tubular member, the valve of the present invention may adopt many solutions, which are based simply on applying a longitudinal pull of variable magnitude to the tubular member. In a preferred embodiment, the flexible tubular member is fixed between two end mouth pieces, each of which is at tached to a portion of the external conduction tube for the liquid to be supplied, there being provided a longitudinal stretching device for the flexible tube, comprising a generally square sectioned outer casing in the inside of which there is housed an externally threaded tubular member which may receive an axially fixed nut which, on rotating, causes the axial movement of said hollow threaded cylindrical body, which move ment is transmitted to the flexible tube on abutting a flange of one of the end mouth pieces attached to said flex ible tube. For a better understanding, there are attached as an example, explanatory drawings of the valve of the pre sent Patent of Invention. As shown in the figures, the present invent tion is based on the arrangement of a flexible tubular member 1, in the interior of which there is disposed a cylindrical body 2 having a smaller diameter and the length of which is not critical, the operation of the valve being based on the principle that the annular clearance 3 between the outer tubular member 1 and the internal cylindrical member 2 may be varied by pulling the tubular member 1 by way of an axial force represent ed by the arrow 4 in Figure 2. In this way, it is poss ible to vary said clearance, thereby varying the sec tion of passage of the liquid being conducted by the tubular member 1, with it being possible to reach a complete closure, as shown in Figures 2 and 4, wherein there may be observed the position of said members in which the clearance 3 has been completely eliminated. The method of producing the longitudinal pull on the tubular member 1 may be variable, a preferred embodi ment according to the present invention on being the arrangement of extreme end pieces 5 and 6 having respective peripheral flanges 7 and 8. Said end pieces are firmly attached to the tubular member 1, in the ends of which they are inserted. The unit formed by the tubular member 1 and end mouth pieces 5 and 6 is positioned in a tubular body 9 having an external thread and having a longitudinal flattened portion 10 and diametrally opposite thereto, a longitu dinal groove 11. An outer member 12 having a square or rectangular sec tion and open on one side thereof receives in the in terior thereof the tubular member 9, which may not rotate in the interior of said body 12 because of the engagement of the flat side 10 and the edges of the groove 11 with two opposite sides of said square sec tioned body 12. An adjusting nut 13 is mounted on the top end of the threaded tubular body 9, forming an abutment against the upper end of the square sectioned body 12. At the bottom end thereof, the square sectioned outer body 12 abuts the lower flange 8 of the end piece 6. With this arrangement, when the nut 13 is rotated, since this is axially fixed by abutting the edge of the square sec tioned member 12, it causes axial movement of the threaded cylindrical body 9, which projects towards the outside, as shown in Figure 14, the upper surface of the nut 13 abutting against the flange 7 of the upper end piece 5. Under these conditions, the flexible tubu lar member 1 is gradually stretched, thereby varying the radial clearance between said tubular member and the internal stoppering body 2, thereby providing the adjustable operation to which the valve is directed. The threaded cylindrical body 9 may be provided on the outer surface thereof with an indicating mark or pro tuberance 14, moving along a slot 15 in the square sectioned body 12, there being provided graduation marks 16 on one of the edges of said slot 15, allowing a visual reference of the degree of opening of the valve to be had. The valve is attached at the ends thereof to the supply tubes 17 and 18 of the medical apparatus to which it is applied. In accordance with the present invention, it is also contemplated that the threaded mechanism for adjusting the liquid passage may be achieved by a two stage sys tem, one being a coarse adjustment stage and the other a fine adjustment stage, such that the former allows a first coarse adjustment to be made towards the desired position, and the latter allows a final, accurate ad justment to be made. As is obvious, there are many constructional details of the valve of the present Patent of Invention which may be variably embodied, without exceeding the scope of the present invention. Thus, for example, the methods of attaching the flexible tubular member to the end pieces and of the latter to the medical apparatus of interest, as well as the systems for producing the axial stretching of the tubular member, system of vis ual indication of the degree of opening, etc., which may be embodied by variations of the present invention, while remaining within the scope thereof. Everything that does not affect, alter, change or modi fy the essence of the valve described hereinbefore will be variable for the effects of the present invention.
