## Description
This invention relates to the synthesis of secondary and tertiary amines containing phosphonyl and carbonyl groups and, more particularly to an improved process for producing N phosphonomethylglycine or derivatives thereof by reductive alkylation. N Phosphonomethylglycine, known in the agricultural chemical art as glyphosate, is a highly effective and commercially important phytotoxicant useful in controlling the growth of germinating seeds, emerging seedlings, maturing and established woody and herbaceous vegetation and aquatic plants. Glyphosate and salts thereof are conveniently applied in an aqueous formulation as a post emergent phytotoxicant or herbicide for the control of one or more monocotyledonous species and one or more dicotyledonous species. Moreover, such compounds are characterized by broad spectrum activity, i.e., they control the growth of a wide variety of plants, including but not limited to ferns conifers aquatic monocotyledons, and dicotyledons. Hershman, U.S. Patent 3 969,398, describes a process for preparing glyphosate in which iminodiacetic acid is reacted with formaldehyde and phosphorus acid to produce N phosphonomethyliminodiacetic acid as an intermediate. This is then oxidized to produce glyphosate. Gaertner, Canadian Patent 1, 039, 739, describes a process for producing glyphosate by reacting aminomethylphosphonic acid and its esters with glyoxal or glyoxylic acid to form carbonylaldiminomethanephosphonates. Thereafter, the carbonylaldiminomethanephosphonates are subjected to catalytic hydrogenation to reduce the double bond and produce glyphosate acid or its esters. The ester groups are then hydrolyzed to produce N phosphonomethylglycine. Both the condensation of aminomethylphosphonate with aldehyde and catalytic hydrogenation of the resultant imine are carried out in organic solvents. For the condensation reaction the solvent is an aromatic hydrocarbon, such as benzene, toluene, or xylene while catalytic hydrogenation is typically carried out in an alcohol. Franz, U.S. Patent 3,799,758, describes the preparation of glyphosate by reaction of ethyl glycinate, formaldehyde, and diethyl phosphonate. Alternative processes described by Franz include phosphonomethylation of glycine with chloromethylphosphonic acid in the presence of sodium hydroxide and oxidation of N phosphinomethylglycine with mercuric chloride. Gaertner U.S. Patent 3,927, 080, describes the production of glyphosate by acid hydrolysis of N t butyl N phosphonomethylglycine or its esters. Tertiary butyl amine is reacted with a bromoacetate ester to produce an ester of N t butyl glycine which is in turn reacted with formaldehyde and phosphorous acid to produce the N t butyl N phosphonomethylglycine precursor. Ehrat, U.S. Patent 4,237, 065, describes a process in which N phosphonomethylglycine is prepared starting from glycine formaldehyde, and a teritary base in an alcoholic solution. After completion of the reaction, a dialkyl phosphite is added and the reaction product is hydrolyzed and then acidified to precipitate the product. While Gaertner, as described in this aforesaid Canadian patent, achieved monoalkylation of aminomethylphosphonic acid by the sequential process of first condensing aminomethylphosphonic acid or its esters with glyoxylic acid and its esters to produce the aldimine and thereafter subjecting the aldimine to catalytic hydrogenation, there are other references which describe the Ikutani, Studies of the N Oxides of N,N Dialkyl Amino Acids. II. The Syntheses of N,N Dialkylglycine and Corresponding N Oxides , Bowman N Substituted Amino Acids. part II. The Reductive Alkylation of Amino Acids , Moser U.S. Patent 4,369,142 describes a process for the preparation of N phosphonomethylglycine in which aminomethylphosphonic acid is reacted in aqueous medium with glyoxal in the presence of sulfur dioxide. In DE 2,725,669 there is disclosed a process for the preparation of secondary amines under hydrogenation conditions in the presence of a catalyst comprising nickel or cobalt and a quaternary ammonium compound. High yields are reported. Mono substituted amino acids, such as glycines and alanines, are prepared by a process disclosed in EPO 0 079 767 wherein a primary amino group and a ketone are reacted under reductive condensation conditions in the presence of a reductant and a hydrogenation catalyst under conditions of elevated temperature and superatmospheric conditions. Nobel metal catalysts are described and the preferred catalyst is palladium on carbon. The present invention is directed to a process for preparing glyphosate and glyphosate derivatives corresponding to the Formula I wherein R is OH, OR³ wherein R³ is selected from monovalent hydrocarbon groups containing 1 to 18 carbon atoms, and OR⁴ wherein R⁴ is a herbicidally acceptable salt forming cation selected from alkali metal cations, alkaline earth metal cations, ammonium, aliphatic ammonium and aliphatic phosphonium and R¹ and R² are independently selected from OH and OR⁴ the process comprising condensing a precursor primary amine corresponding to the formula where R¹ and R² are as defined above, in an aqueous reaction medium with a carbonyl compound corresponding to the formula where R is as defined above and reducing without isolation the condensation product to produce the secondary amine of Formula I , wherein the condensation and reduction reactions are carried out at a temperature between about 0 C and about 150 C, and wherein the reduction is effected by catalytic hydrogenation, electrochemically or with a chemical, reducing agent other than sulfur dioxide. The term monovalent hydrocarbon as used herein includes alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aralkyl inclusive of both straight and branched chain radicals, such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, cyclopropyl, cyclohexyl, tertiary butyl, iso butyl, n butyl and the various forms amyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, tridecyl, tetradecyl, pentadecyl, hexadecyl, heptadecyl, octadecyl, benzyl, phenylethyl, naphthylethyl, tolylethyl, methylbenzyl, phenylbenzyl and the corresponding alkenyl, and alkynyl groups and the like, aryl groups and alkaryl groups, such as phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, naphthyl, vinylphenyl and the like. It is preferred that such monovalent hydrocarbon group contains from 1 to 18 carbon atoms and be alkyl alkenyl, or alkynyl groups. In accordance with the present invention it has been discovered that glyphosate and various glyphosate derivatives can be produced with very high selectivity by the reductive alkylation of aminomethylphosphonic acid or its salts in an aqueous medium with a carbonyl compound, such as for example glyoxylic acid, a glyoxylate salt a glyoxylate ester or a glyoxylate polyacetal salt or ester. Normally the carbonyl compound is present in the aqueous medium as a hydrate. In the process of the invention, contrary to the results reported for the reductive alkylation of glycine with linear aldehydes such as acetaldehyde or butyraldehyde, high conversions of the reactants to the monoalkylated product can be achieved with relatively minimal dialkylation. Thus, not only high selectivity but also good overall yields are obtained. In the aqueous reaction medium, reduction of the intermediate reaction product can be carried out by catalytic hydrogenation, by electrochemical reduction or by non catalytic chemical reduction, i.e. using a reducing agent effective without the necessity of a catalyst for example, a hydride containing salt dissolved in the aqueous reaction medium . The reaction proceeds through condensation of amine and carbonyl compound to form an aldimino intermediate followed by Preferably, the pH of the aqueous solution containing the amine and carbonyl compound reactant is adjusted to between 4.0 and about 11.0, preferably 5.0 to 10.0, prior to carrying out the reductive alkylation. Fig. 1 illustrates the influence of pH on selectivity in the preparation of glyphosate or its sodium salt or esters by reaction of aminomethylphosphonic acid or its ester and glyoxylic acid or its ester. Adjustment of pH is carried out by addition of a base typically an alkali metal hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. Tertiary amines, such as triethylamine, may also be used. In a particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention, the pH is adjusted with a primary amine or secondary amine which carries through to provide the salt forming cation for a glyphosate salt type reaction product. After adjustment of pH, the aqueous solution is either contacted with hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenation catalyst or placed in an electrochemical cell where the intermediate formed by the condensation reaction is cathodically reduced. Alternatively, the intermediate can be reduced using a chemical reducing agent that is effective without the necessity of a catalyst. In the case of catalytic hydrogenation, a wide variety of hydrogenation catalysts may be used including various platinum group metals, such as platinum palladium, iridium osmium, rhodium, or ruthenium and various other transition metals such as nickel and cobalt. Other metals, such as copper and zinc can also be used. Either elemental metals or various compounds of such metals, such as oxides, halides, and organometallics can be used. Where the catalyst is a solid state material, it can be either supported, such as, for example, platinum on carbon, palladium on alumina, nickel on kieselguhr, etc., or unsupported, for example, Raney nickel or platinum oxide. Various soluble compounds of catalytic metals can also be employed. Palladium on carbon, nickel on kieselguhr, and Raney nickel are particularly effective and convenient catalysts and thus somewhat preferred. But depending on the conditions and nature of the substrate, a number of other catalysts may be equally effective or superior. The preferred concentration of catalyst also varies widely depending on substrate and conditions. However, the optimum proportion for any particular system can be readily arrived at by routine testing. Temperature is not generally a highly critical variable where the reductive alkylation of the invention is carried out by catalytic hydrogenation. Broadly, temperatures in the range of 0 C to 150 C may be used, although temperatures in the range of 20 C to 90 C are preferred. As illustrated in Fig. 2, selectivity may deteriorate at temperatures above 90 C. Pressure can also be varied widely with acceptable conversions and selectivity achieved at hydrogen pressures from atmospheric to 4.60x10⁸ Newton meter² N m² or higher. In order to achieve high selectivity in monoalkylation of primary amines, it has not been found necessary to operate with any significant excess of the amine reactant. Substantially equimolar proportions can be used and, in fact a slight excess of carbonyl compound, for example, a carbonyl to amine molar ratio of 1.0 to 1.2, is generally preferred. The concentration of each reactant may vary over a wide range. For convenience, however, reactant concentrations ranging from 2 to 20 by weight are preferred. In the case of electrochemical reduction, concentrations of reactants, pH, and temperature are governed by essentially the same considerations discussed above. To carry out the electrochemical reductive alkylation, the solution of amine and carbonyl compound is placed in an electrolytic cell, preferably as the catholyte in a cell having a porous barrier between catholyte and anolyte chambers. Such a cell is illustrated, for example, in Fig. 3. This cell includes a container 1 having a porous alumina cup 3 disposed therein. Inside cup 3 is a platinum mesh anode 5. A mercury pool 7, covering the bottom wall 9 of container 1, serves as the cathode. Cup 3 thus divides the cell into anolyte chamber 11 and catholyte chamber 13, respectively. In operating this cell, any convenient electrolyte can be used for the anolyte. Current is applied preferably at a density of approximately 0.001 to 0.5 amps per square centimeter to effect the reduction. Electrolytic reduction may also be carried out in an undivided cell whose construction may be essentially identical to that of Fig. 3 except that cup 3 is absent and no separate anolyte liquor is used. Alternatively, electrochemical reduction can take place in a flow cell, such as that illustrated in Fig. 4. In this cell a catholyte flow channel 15 is disposed between a cathode 17 and a semi permeable membrane 19 which comprises an ion exchange resin. Reaction solution contained in a reservoir 25 is continuously passed through catholyte channel 15 by means of a pump 27. On the opposite side of membrane 19 from channel 15 is an anolyte flow channel 21 and a carbon anode 23. Anolyte solution contained in a reservoir 29 is continuously passed through anolyte channel 21 by means of a pump 31. The cathode of the electrochemical reduction cell is preferably comprised of a material which exhibits a high hydrogen overpotential in the electrochemical reduction system. Such include, for example, mercury, cadmium, and lead. Other cathode materials such as palladium platinum or graphite may be used. Selection of the anode material is not particularly critical. Thus, for example, the anode may be of platinum, carbon, graphite, platinized titanium, stainless steel, etc. In further alternative embodiment of the invention, the reductive alkylation can be carried out utilizing a chemical reducing agent that is effective for reducing the aldimine without the necessity of a catalyst. Conveniently, the chemical reducing agent is a condensed phase material, such as a salt, which may be dissolved in the aqueous reaction medium. Particularly preferred chemical reducing agents include the alkali metal borohydrides. Product may be recovered from the reaction solution by various conventional methods. Where the reductive alkylation is conducted by catalytic hydrogenation using a solid state catalyst, the first step in product recovery is removal of the catalyst, as by filtration or centrifugation. The recovered catalyst may in most instances be recycled and reslurried with fresh feed solution containing amine and carbonyl compound reactants. Once the reaction solution is clarified, reaction product may be separated for example, by evaporation. However, in the case of glyphosate or its salt, the product need not be recovered and the solution can be used directly as a herbicide. The following examples illustrate the invention.

A 20 mL portion of this solution was placed in the anode compartment and a 30 mL portion was placed in the cathode compartment of an electrochemical cell having an Alundum porous alumina cup divider separating anode and cathode compartments. The cathode was a mercury pool 7 cm² and the anode a platinum screen. Direct current 0.1 amp at a voltage of 3 v was passed through the cell for 3.13 hours, during which time the temperature of the catholyte and anlyte was maintained at 25 C by external cooling. The pH of the catholyte was maintained at below 9.5 by addition of aqueous hydrochloric acid. After the aforesaid period of reaction, the catholyte was analyzed for glyphosate. This analysis revealed that 0.16g of glyphosate had been produced representing a yield of 17.2 . Aminomethylphosphonic acid was reductively alkylated with glyoxylic acid under the electrochemical conditions of Example 63 except that a graphite rod was substituted for the mercury pool cathode. A 5.6 yield of glyphosate was obtained. Electrochemical reductive alkylation of aminomethylphosphonic acid with glyoxylic acid was carried out in the manner generally described in Example 63 except that a platinum cathode 13cm² was employed. A 23 yield of glyphosate was obtained. Aminomethylphosphonic acid 1.98 g 0.018 mole and glyoxylic acid 1.90 g 0.02 mole were dissolved in water 100 mL , and the pH of the resulting solution adjusted to 7.0 by addition of 2.5 N sodium hydroxide. This solution was employed as the catholyte in a divided parallel plate electrochemical cell. The anolyte was a solution of potassium acetate 7.0 g and water 100 mL . The cell utilized in electrochemical reduction of this example corresponded generally to that illustrated in Fig. 4. It had a cadmium cathode, carbon anode, and was divided by a perfluorosulfonic acid ion exchange membrane sold under the trade designation Nafion by E. I. duPont de Nemours Company. Teflon spacer flow channels 0.25 in formed the body of the cell. Each cell compartment was fed by a Riton head pump from a 150 mL reservoir. A current of 0.3 amp 30 mA cm² was passed through the cell for 6.75 hours. A 19.3 yield of glyphosate was observed. Glyphosphate was prepared in the manner described in Example 2 except that, prior to adjustment of pH, dimethylammonium chloride 1 equivalent was added to the reactor charge. The pH was adjusted to 8.0 After the reaction was allowed to run overnight, a 46.1 yield of the dimethylamine salt of N phosphonomethylglycine was obtained 100 selectivity at 46. 1 conversion . Aminomethylphosphonic acid 95 strength 12.0 g 0.103 mole and glyoxylic acid 10.8 g 0.108 mole were taken as a slurry in water 40 mL . While the slurry was agitated with a magnetic stirrer and cooled with an ice water bath, the pH of the aqueous liquid phase was adjusted to 6.8 by addition of 50 by weight sodium hydroxide solution. The resultant yellow colored solution was transferred to a 300 mL autoclave. Total weight of the solution was 87.9 g. After transfer of the solution to the autoclave, 10 palladium on carbon catalyst 2.10 g was added to the solution and the reactor pressurized to 6.89x10⁶ N m² with hydrogen. The reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at room temperature. Thereafter the catalyst was filtered off and the solution analyzed by HPLC. A quantitative yield of glyphosphate salt 17.4g as the acid equivalent was found. The product solution was concentrated and treated with concentrated hydrochloric acid. The sodium chloride that precipitated was removed and the solution reconcentrated. After 3 successive water concentration treatments for removal of excess HCl, a crystalline material was formed. From this crystalline material was isolated 15.2 g of glyphosate for an isolated yield of 87 . Aminomethylphosphonic acid 95 strength 2.5 g 0.021 mole and hydrated sodium polyglyoxylate 83.2 by weight 3.17 g 0.024 mole were dissolved in water 40 mL . The solution was heated to 50 C for 1 hour after which the pH was adjusted to 7.0 by addition of 2.5 normal sodium hydroxide. The neutralized solution was transferred to a 300 mL autoclave, 10 palladium on carbon catalyst 1.0 g was added, and the reactor was sealed with argon and then pressurized with hydrogen gas to 6.89 x 10⁶ N m². After reaction at 27 C for 3 and 3 4 hours, the product was analyzed. A 91.4 yield of glyphosphate salt was found. The conditions of Example 48 were replicated but the cathode potential was held at 1.0 volts vs. the standard calomel electrode reference. Sufficient current was passed to convert 67 of the starting material to glyphosate. Analysis indicated a 94.4 selectivity to glyphosphate salt. Aminomethylphosphonic acid 0.05 mole 5.5 g was dissolved in water, and the pH of the resulting solution adjusted to 11 by addition of a 50 by weight sodium hydroxide solution 7.5 g . Thereafter, aliquots of glyoxylic acid and sodium borohydride were alternatively added to the aqueous solution. The total amount of glyoxylic acid added was 0.05 mole 7.4 g , and the total amount of sodium borohydride added was 0.74 g 0.012 mole . Initially, about 1 5 of the total amount of glyoxylic acid was added to the solution, the pH was adjusted to 11 with sodium hydroxide, and about 1 5 of the total amount of sodium borohydride was added at 30 C. This procedure was repeated 4 times until the total amounts of glyoxylic acid and sodium borohydride had been added. After each addition of sodium borohydride, the solution clouded momentarily. After addition of the aforesaid amounts of glyoxylic acid and sodium borohydride, unreacted aminomethylphosphonic acid remained in the reaction solution. Alternate addition of glyoxylic acid and sodium borohydride with intermediate adjustment of pH to 11 with sodium hydroxide was repeated until an initial 2.5 g glyoxylic acid, 0.26 g sodium borohydride, and 2 g sodium hydroxide had been added to the solution. A sample was then taken from the reaction solution, analyzed by HPLC, and found to contain 1.62 g glyphosate per 100 g of water. Aminomethylphosphonic acid 0.05 mole 5.5 g was dissolved in water, and the pH of the resulting solution adjusted to 11.0 by addition of 50 sodium hydroxide solution 10 g . Glyoxylic acid 0.05 mole 7.4 g total and sodium borohydride 0.012 mole 0.47 g total were added incrementally and alternately over a 5 hour period with the pH of the solution being adjusted by addition of sodium hydroxide solution before each pair of additions of glyoxylic acid and sodium borohydride. A total of 4.0 g 50 sodium hydroxide was used for pH adjustment. Addition of reactants was carried out at room temperature. Upon addition of increments of sodium borohydride a momentary clouding of the reaction solution was observed along with the appearance of small bubbles. The reaction was monitored by HPLC of material from which water had been stripped. At the conclusion of the addition of the aforesaid amounts of reactants, the stripped reaction mixture was found to contain 21.6 by weight glyphosate. In an effort to complete the reaction, additional increments of glyoxylic acid 14.8 g total , sodium borohydride 0.94 g total , and sodium hydroxide 8.0 g total were added to the reaction solution. An aliquot of this solution was stripped for analysis by HPLC. The remaining solution 123.7 g was acidified with hydrochloric acid 17 g to a pH of 2.0, but no crystallization took place, apparently due to the presence of glycolic acid. Overall, 3 times the stoichiometric amounts of glyoxylic acid and sodium borohydride were used in this example. Samples taken throughout the reaction were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance. The analyses showed an increase of glycolic acid singlet at 3.5 ppm and a decrease of the aminomethylphosphonic acid methylene singlets and a corresponding shift to the glyphosate methylene. Up to the stoichiometric amount of addition, the aminomethylphosphonic acid peaks were half the size of the glyphosate peaks. After twice the stoichiometric amounts of glyoxylic acid had been added, the glyphosate peaks were 5 times greater than the aminomethylphosphonic acid peaks. After acidification only glyphosate peaks were observed along with a new singlet at 3.0 ppm. Two runs were made according to the protocol of this example. In one, 6.00 g of glyphosate was obtained 71.0 yield and in the other, 5.91 g of glyphosate was obtained 69.9 yield . Sodium chloride was separated from the glyphosate product by treating the reaction mixture with hydrochloric acid and removing insoluble sodium chloride by filtration. The filtrate was stripped to produce a glyphosate hydrochloride which was brown in color. Addition of a small quantity of water formed small white crystals of glyphosate. By this workup, 6.5 g sodium chloride and 1.6 g glyphosate were obtained. The glyphosate was crystallized twice from water and the recrystallized product analyzed by HPLC and found to be 94.8 pure.
