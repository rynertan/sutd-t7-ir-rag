## Description
HIGH TRANSCONDUCTANCE COMPLEMENTARY IC STRUCTURE This invention is directed to high performance comple mentary integrated circuits and their fabrication. In particular the invention relates to n channel and channel Al,Ga As Heterostructure Insulated Gate Field Effect Transistors HIGFETs on a common planar wafer surface. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the heterostructure used for HIFGETs consists of an undoped GaAs buffer layer grown on a semi insulatingGaAs substrate followed by an undoped Al,Ga As gate layer. Both of these layers are epitaxially grown under conditions to make them as close to intrinsic and insulating as possible. Both the n and p channelHIGFETs utilize the high mobility, two dimensional 2D electron hole gas which is induced at the Al,Ga As GaAs hetero interface by the application of a suitable gate bias voltage. A self aligned gate SAG process is used to form the source drain regions of the transistors with p implanted regions for p channel and n implanted regions for n channelHIGFETs. The electrons holes in the channel come from the source drain contacts when a suitable gate bias is applied.The use of undoped heterostructures allows both n and p channel transistors to be fabricated in the same epitaxial layers on the same wafer surface by a planar process. The absence of impurities also leads to high electron hole channel mobility resulting in FET operation in the saturation velocity regime for high transconductance transistors.Complementary GaAs based circuits which utilize both n and p channel transistors offer significant advantages over circuits utilizing only n channel transistors in terms of noise margin and power dissipation and consequently circuit integration level. In the prior art an article by Katayama et al, wA New Two Dimensional Electron GasField Effect Transistor Fabricated on UndopedAlGaAs GaAs Heterostructure , Jpn.J.AppI.Phys., Vol.23, L150 2, March 84, shows an n channel device which utilizes an undoped AlGaAs gate and is a 2D electron gas field effect transistor. It is not a complementary device. Solomon et al, A GaAs GateHeterojunction FET , IEEE Electron Device Letters, Vol.5t No.9, Sept.84, p379 80, describe an n channel heterostructure FET with an insulating gate but this also is not a complementary device. A different kind of complementary device is shown in an article by Kiehi et al, Complementary p MODFET and n HB MESFET Al,Ga As Transistors , IEEE Electron Device Letters,Vol.EDL 5, No.12, Dec. 84, p521 23.A similar disclosure is shown in Kiehl et al, Complementary p MODFET and n HB MESFET Al,Ga As FET s , IEDM 84, p854 55. Both of these publications describe a complementary device structure consisting of a conventional p channel MODFET, made with a doped Al,Ga As gate and an n channel MESFET. This is not a planar device and does not utilize a 2 dimensional electron and hole gas in an undoped high mobility channel for both the n and p channel devices. In the substantially different JFET technology, the fabrication of n channel and p channel GaAs based devices on the same wafer has been disclosed, as for example by Zuleeg et al, Double Implanted GaAsComplementary JFET s , IEEE Electron Device Letters,Vol.EDL 5, No.l, Jan.1984, p21 23.J FET devices do not utilize 2 dimensional electron hole gases in undoped, high mobility channels. The HIGFET approach takes maximum advantage of the heterostructure technology to create twodimensional 2D gases of both electrons and holes in a planar undoped multilayer Al,Ga As GaAs structure.The 2D, electron hole gas is created at the Al,Ga As GaAs heterointerface by applying a positive negative gate bias. The 2D electron hole gas has a high electron hole mobility because of the reduction of the impurity scattering. This allows FET operation in the velocity saturation regime at low voltages for high transconductance transistors. TheSAG approach is essential for HIGFET devices since electrical contact must be made directly to the 2D high mobility electron and hole gases, which are present only under the gates. The planar structure of this invention is important to achieve the high processing yield required for VLSI circuits. The insulating gate approach for both the n and p channel devices allows a larger voltage swing on the input gates without leakage or shorting.The insulating gates also improve the threshold voltage uniformity and control since the threshold voltage is much less critically dependent on the thickness and doping of the gate layer than normal MODFET device structures. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figures la and Ib are schematics of the device cross section for a n channel HIGFET and a p channel HIGFET. Figure 2a shows the band structure at the point of establishing the 2D electron gas for the n channel device of Figure la Figure 2b shows the band structure at the point of establishing the 2D hole gas for the p channel device of Figure lb andFigure 2c shows the band structure at zero bias of the normally off non conductive enhancement type complementary devices. Figure 3 shows the cross section of the complementary HIGFET inverter. Figure 4 shows the processing steps for the complementary HIGFET fabrication. Figure 5 shows band structure of an alternateHIGFET device structure. Figure 6 is an electrical line schematic of the CMOS like GaAs structure shown in Figure 3. Figure 7 is a graphical presentation of the transfer characteristics and transconductance of n HIGFET at 77k. Figure 8 is a graphical presentation of the transfer characteristics and transconductances of p HIGFET at 77k. DESCRIPTION The HIGFET device approach is illustrated inFigures 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows schematically a cross section view of n and p channel devices while Figure 2 shows schematically the energy band diagrams for the HIGFET devices starting at the gate electrode 15 and going perpendicular to the wafer surface. TheHIGFET utilizes two epitaxial layers 12 and 13 grown on a semi insulating GaAs wafer 11. The first layer 12 is pure, undoped GaAs, which is grown under conditions to make it as close to intrinsic as possible. The second layer 13 is a pure and undoped layer of Al,Ga As, which is again grown under conditions to make it as close to intrinsic as possible. The basic mechanisms which give rise to nand p channel HIGFETs are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2c shows the relative positions of the conduction and valence bands in the insulating GaAs layer, the insulating Al,Ga As layer and the position of theFermi level of the metal gate electrode in a device without external electrical bias. The position of theFermi level is shown to be midway between the conduction and valence bands of the GaAs and Al,Ga As layers for purposes of illustration and in practice the exact Fermi level position will depend on the amounts and types of residual impurities and defects in these undoped layers.Similarly, the gate metalFermi level is shown midway between the conduction and valence bands of the Al,Ga As layer, but its actual position will depend on the work functions of the metal chosen and the position of the Fermi level at the surface of the Al,Ga As surface. In the unbiased state shown in Figure 2c, a conducting channel does not exist under the gate, i.e. both the n and p channel complementary HIGFETs are normally off enhancement devices. The 2D high mobility electron n channel gas or hole p channel gas is created at the Al,Ga As GaAs heterointerface by applying a positive or a negative gate voltage. between the gate and the source contact, thereby providing in effect a current channel or trough between source and drain implanted regions which act as electron or hole reservoirs.The source and drain regions are heavily doped by ion implantation and have Fermi levels near the conduction valence band edges. Figures 2a and 2b show bands with applied gate voltages. In Figure 2a, a positive gate bias is applied and when Ec crosses the Fermi level, EF, a 2D electron gas is induced. Likewise in Figure 2b a negative gate bias is applied and when Ev crosses the Fermi level, EF, a 2D hole gas is induced. The electrons or holes are provided by the n type or p type implanted regions, and the electron or hole density is controlled by the gate voltage.To first order, the threshold voltages of these devices are determined by the gate barrier height f and the energy band discontinuities AE Vtn n Ec, Vtp p Ev. The two dimensional electron and hole gas densities, n5 and Pst respectively, are determined to first order by the relations n5 E Vg Vtn q d Adn p5 E Vg Vtp q d Adp where d is the thickness of the Al,Ga As insulator, q is the electronic charge, and Ad is the width of the 2D gases. The threshold voltage can be minimized and the two dimensional electron and hole gas densities can be maximized by making hEC and veg as large as possible. The magnitude of hEc and hEv both increase with the fraction x of Al in the AlxGal xAs layer.Consequently, the device physics favors as large an Al composition as possible, commensurate with the technical problems associated with using AlAs or nearAlAs composition materials in devices. Grading of the composition of the i AlGaAs layer between the i GaAs interface and the surface may be desirable to minimize the problems associated with high Al compositions. The structure and fabrication of our complementary n and p channel HIGFET will now be described. Referring to Figure la there is shown first an n channel portion of a planar complementary HIGFET device. A semi insulating GaAs substrate wafer 11 has grown thereon by molecular beam epitaxy MBE an insulating GaAs i GaAs layer 12. Then an insulating aluminum gallium arsenide i Al,Ga As layer 13 is grown by MBE. Alternately, MOCVD could be used to form these epitaxial layers. On the epitaxial surface is fabricated a gate such as a WSi gate 15.The regions 16 and 17 on either side of the gate extending to the ohmic contact regions, as delineated by the lines 18 and 19 are high dose ion implanted with a donor n species, such as Si, the gate 15 preventing any of the ion implant beneath itself and so providing the self aligned gate structure. An implant anneal is made and then metallic contacts 21 and 22 are deposited on the surface. In a preferred embodiment the metallization is AuGeNi based. A conventional alloy heat treatment forms these contacts to the heavily implanted region as shown by the dashed lines. Referring now to Figure lb there is shown in the second place a p channel portion 10 of a planar complementary HIGFET device. The p channel portion ofFigure lb is the same substrate wafer 11 and is normally positioned adjacent the n channel portion described above. The insulating layers 12 and 13 are the same layers identified as layers 12 and 13 ofFigure la. A WSi gate 15 is the same as inFigure la. An acceptor p implant is made at regions 16 and 17 on either side of the metal silicide gate 15 . An implant anneal is made and then ohmic contacts 21 and 22 are deposited and alloyed to the high dose p implanted region. In a preferred embodiment the metallization is AuZnAu based. In Figure 3 a cross section view of a planar complementary HIGFET inverter is shown using as far as possible the same identifying numerals as used in the individual sections Figure la and lb. The n channel device 10 and the p channel device 10 are both formed on the common semi insulating GaAs substrate 11.Specifically, the GaAs substrate 11 has grown thereon by MBE an insulating undoped GaAs layer 12 and then an insulating undoped Al,Ga As layer 13. In Figure 5 one example of an alternate fabrication which has been demonstrated shows a thin layer of i AlAs between the i GaAs and the i Al,Ga As layers, where the i AlAs layer is added to improve the insulating properties of the gate and to increase the valence and electron band energy discontinuities AEc and rev, which increases the electron hole concentrations in the channels. In other embodiments, the composition profile of the gate can be graded or include various composition sublayers to optimize the device performance. Referring to Figure 4, a flow chart of the planar self aligned gate by ion implantation n channel and p channel HIGFET IC process for completing the complementary IC of Figure 3 is illustrated. The first step listed is the MBE heterostructure growth of the i GaAs layer 12 and the i Al,Ga As layer 13.Growth conditions are adjusted to obtain as close to intrinsic semiconductor material as possible with very low total doping. Then on the epitaxial surface 13a a high temperature stability refractory metal or metal silicide such as WSix is deposited to form the gates 15 and 15 . A double masking of the surface allows sequential n and p selective ion implants. The source and drain regions 16 and 17 on either side of the gate 15 extending to the ohmic contact regions, as delineated by lines 18 and 19, are ion implanted with an n implant while the regions around gate 15 are covered. Then the regions 16 and 17 on either side of the gate 15 are ion implanted with a p implant while the regions of gate 15 are covered. In one embodiment Si was used to create the n implanted regions and Mg or Be have each been used to form the p implanted regions. These two ion implants provide the self aligned gates, the gates 15 and 15 preventing any of the ion implant beneath itself and so providing the self aligned gate structure. A high temperature implant anneal process is the next step to activate the ion implanted n and p species. This implant anneal can be in a conventional semiconductor anneal furnace, or rapid thermal annealing using an optical lamp can also be used. Dielectric anneal encapsulants, such as Si3N4 or an As overpressure can be used to optimize the anneal activation. Alternate processes for forming self aligned gate structures which utilize SiO2 and photoresist to mask the gate region during ion implantation and deposit the actual metal gate after implant anneal can also be used. The metallic drain and source electrodes 21, 22, 21 and 22 are deposited and delineated using standard photolithographic liftoff techniques. In one preferred embodiment this ohmic contact isAuGeNi based for the n channel HIGFET 10 andAuZnAu based for the p channel HIGFET 10 . Then a conventional alloy heat treatment is used so that ohmic contacts are formed to the heavily implanted regions as shown by the dashed lines of Figures la and lb. The individual complementary devices such as 10 and 10 of Figure 3 are electrically isolated one from the other by ion implantation of a neutral species, such as protons, which destroys any residual electrical conduction between the devices. A photo resist is used to protect the active devices during the isolation ion implant. The n channel and p channel HIGFET devices can then be connected to form standard complementary logic gates using a standard metal interconnect system as is shown in Figure 3 to form gates such as the simple inverter shown schematically in Figure 6. Both n channel and p channel HIGFET devices have been fabricated and tested at both room temperature and 77K. As shown in Figure 5, two different Al,GA As GaAs heterostructures have been grown for device fabrication. The first employs a homogeneous undoped A10,3Ga0,7 layer as the gate insulator. The second incorporates an undoped AlAs layer next to the GaAs in an attempt to increase the conduction and valence band discontinuities, hEc and hEV respectively. For a nominal lpm gate length n channelHIGFET, the extrinsic transconductance gm is 218 mS mm at room temperature and 385 mS mm at 77K. Figure 7 shows a plot of both the square root of Id, and gm versus the gate to source voltage Vgs for an n channel device. For a nominal lpm gate length p channelHIGFET the values of the extrinsic transconductance gm are 28.3 mS mm at room temperature and 59.3 mS mm at 77K, respectively. Figure 8 shows a plot of both the square root of 1ds and gm versus the gate to source voltage Vgs for a p channel device. The specification has shown a complementary device based on Al,Ga As GaAs material system, however the invention can clearly be applied to other semiconductor material systems such as Al,In As Ga,In As, in which the gate material is a larger gap insulating semiconductor and the active channel material is a high mobility semiconductor.
