# Functionalised carbonaceous adsorbents, which may be ion exchange materials or precursors thereof,processes of making and using them.

## Abstract
Carbonaceous macroporous polymer adsorbent particles, as described in U.S. Patent 4040990 and British Patents 154440 and 1543376 but pyrolysed at 300 to 800 DEG C and derived from monomer containing styrene, have, according to this invention, functional groups imparted thereto. The functionalised polymer may be useful as adsorbents, ion exchange resins or precursors thereof. They may be made by subjecting the particles to electrophilic substitution or addition or free radical substitution subsequent to, or at the same time as, the pyrolysis step used in their preparation. They may be used in ion exchange or adsorption processes for treating liquids or gases. The ion exchange groups may be weak or strong base or weak or strong acid groups, and may be imparted by such reactions as halogenation, sulphonation, chloromethylation, chlorosulfonation and oxidation, alone or followed by aminolysis or other conventional functionalisation reaction.
