# FLUID PRESSURE SIGNAL CONTROLLER

## Abstract
A fluid pressure and electrical signal controller for providing a predetermined regulated vacuum signal from a variable source in response to changes in position of a rotatable input shaft when attached thereto and an electrical signal at a predetermined position of the input shaft. A pressure force balance type vacuum modulator valve is preloaded and biased by a spring connected to a cam follower which tracks a rotary cam turned by the input shaft. The modulator valve is slidably attached to the controller body for adjusting the preload length of the spring and a rotatable adjustment ring engages the valve and is threadedly received on the controller body for effecting sliding adjustment of the valve position on the controller body.
