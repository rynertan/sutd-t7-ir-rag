## Description
DLELECLRIC RING LASER GY BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to improvements in ring laser gyroscopes, and mre particularly to a ring laser gyrose in which a resonator structure is provided adjacent a gain medium and about which rotation is determined.2. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART Th the past, ring laser gyroscopes, or gyros, have been fabricated incorporating a laser as a part of an enclosed cptical loop or path through the ff e laser light has been directed in opposite directions. been the optical path was caused to rotate relative to a fixed frame of reference about an axis of rotational sensitivity the laser light traveling in one direction in the enclosed optical loop appeared to traverse the optical path faster in one direction than in the other, according to the well known Sagnac effect.Thus, the frequency of the laser light in each direction was changed due to the relativistic effect an amount relatable to the rate of rotation. Ideally, the counter traveling light beams should be of a single mode.However, due to scattering and other phenomena, discussed below, constraining light in both beams to a single mode is extremely difficult. As the counter traveling beams are of the same mode, current laser gyros are subject to a phencmena called mode locking or lock in of the two counter traveling modes as the inertial rotation rate of the gyro drops to all rotation rates, on the order, for example, of 20 degrees per hour, or so.Mode locking is an effect in which the counter rotating light beams lock or couple onto each other at the satire frequency, ring the gyro output appear to be zero. Numerous gyros have been advanced to attempt to reduce the effects of mode locking, such as for instance, U. S. Patents 3,741,657 and 3,845,819. U.S. Patent 4,132,482 shows a typical method for reducing node locking by dithering the gyro at a rate equal to the lock in characteristic of the gyro. As mentioned, one problem which causes inaccuracies in laser gyros is the scattering of photons from one mode to another, as a first order coupling effect. Scattering may be caused, for instance, by impurities or inhomogeneities in the laser cavity, and results in the photons traveling in one direction influencing the photons traveling in the other direction, making the interpretation of the light emerging fran the laser ring difficult, if not impossible to interpret. Spatial bole burning is a second order coupling effect which also causes interpretation difficulties. Spatial holes are formed or burned in a ring laser as the two counter rotating modes produce stanaing waves in the laser cavity when the difference frequency is emoll, for example, at low rotation rates. In efforts to correct for such spatial holes, it has been found, at least in the case of of free running ruby lasers, that affixing fixed external mirrors and physically oscillating the ruby back and forth longitudinally with an audio frequency driver prevents the formation of the spatial holes in the distribution. Frequency hole burning , another source of laser gyro inaccuracies, results from a selective depopulation of an inhomogeneous upper state group through laser stimulated emission. In a ring laser gyro, if the gain distribution peak is centered between the right and left hana moving modes as the rotation decreases, an overlap between the two Tholes appears, and one mode quenches the other. Mode pulling is still another phenomena which causes inaccuracies in interpreting the data. Mode pulling is a frequency shift due to anomalous dispersion in the laser cavity, which affects the scale factor, bet its effects can be generally compensated by appropriate gyro design. In efforts to compensate for these effects, it has been proposed, among other things, to bias the gyro, so that at slow speeds the rotation appears to be hither however, the biasing techmiques used in the past have increased the costs of the gyros, and, additionally often have reduced the reliability of the devices achieved. One example of a compensating biasing technique which has been proposed is shown in U. S. Patent 3,373,650. Recently, it has been proposed to use a fiber optic ring as a part of the laser gyro, such as shewn in U. S. Patent 4, 13,365. The noise, scattering effects and the like, however, introduced by such fiber rings has been a significant problem. After intensive efforts have been made to produce optical fibers with extremely low loss, discoveries of materials, such as silica Ge mixtures, which have extremely low loss in the vicinity of 0.2 db per kilometer have been wade. Other materials, such as ZnCl, theoretically should exhibit a scattering loss less than 0.a1 db per kilometer, as well. effort to advance a gyro which has reduced problems associated with lock in, bias drifts, and scale factcr variations is shown in a paper ofEzekiel et al. entitled Passive Ring Resonator Laser Gyroscope , Applied Physics Letters, 5W77. In their paper, Ezekiel et al. show two separate rings or cavities, one containing a separate gain medium. and the other a Fabry Perot interferometer, as the rotation sensing element.

In the following description, the wDrd silica should not be construed to limit the choice of materials to silica alone, but exemplifies one of the very low optical loss dielectric naterials having an index of refraction greater than ones at the laser wavelength which cculd be used herein. In accordance with a brood aspct of the invention, a ring laser gyro is presented, including a ring resonator structure including a silica ring and a gain medium su lcEnding the silica ring. The silica ring is fabricated so that light within the ring will penetrate the gain medium a distance depending upo the mode of light in the ring, enabling only a selected mode to be coupled into the gain medium. In accordance with another brood aspect of the invention, a resonator structure for use in a ring laser gyro is presented. The resonator includes a silica cylinder with highly polished surfaces. The silica cylinder is of a particular thickness and length to support prtagation of only selected modes of energy excitation.

In the various figures of the drawing, like reference numerals are used to denote like parts. In addition, various sizes and dimensions of the parts have been exaggerated or distorted for ease of description and clarity of illustration.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE As described in detail below, the gyro in accordance with one embodiment of the invention as shown in Fig. 7, is configured using a silica ring about 0.2 meters in diameter with an inner diameter approximately 2 centimeters smaller than the outer diameter and with a similar thickness along the z axis, the z axis being the cylinder axis2. The ring is fabricated out of very high purity, stress relived silica, with all surfaces very highly polished, or super polished. Silica appears to be one good choice of materials for use in the resonator of the invention because, among other things, silica can be use with extremely low scattering loss, is highly stable, and has a law coefficient of thermal expansion. Other materials, however, might be suitable also. In the following description of the gyro in accordance with the inven tion, two optical properties of the dielectric ring must be considered, the indexes of refraction and reflection, as will become apparent from the description of the operation of the gyro set forth below. A gra of the refractive index for silica is shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen fran Fig. 1 that the refractive index for silica varies approximately exponentially between about 1.45 and 1.55 for wavelengths of light between 200 and 1200 nanometers. A go of the reflective index of a material, in this case, silica, is hown in Fig, 2, It can be seen that, in general, the amount of light reflected fran a surface varies, depending upon the angle of incidence of the light on the surface. Thus, below the critical angle, c the fraction of reflected perallel and perpendicularly polarized light beams, denoted by curves 15 and 16, is relatively constant at small angles of incidence, but approaches unity as the angle of incidence approaches the critical angle. Above the critical angle, the light is totally internally reflected. Thus, as shown in Fig. 3, a silica ring 10 is shown, for a general case, having an inside radius A and an outside radius B. It is assumed that a light bsam 11 has been produced in the ring 10 to reflect therewithin at an angle, . The dimensions of the ring 10 are selected so that for the particular wavelength of light used, an integral nnmber of reflections are produced as the light beam travels once around the ring 10. Thus, in a ring so constructed, a particular light beam travels on the same path each time it traverses the ring 10. The angle between adjacent reflections on opposite sides of the ring mea sured fran the center of the ring is denoted the angle, .In addition, as explained below in detail, according to the Goos Hanchen effect, evenescent waves are produced by the light circulating and reflecting within the ring 10, the evenescent waves extending beyond the outer radius, A, of the ring 10a distance 2, dented by the dotted line 12. Assuming light having a wavelength of 1,3 microns is introduced into the silica ring 10, the critical angle for a Silica to vacuum interface is about 761 mradians or about 43.6 degrees . Using the rayoptic picture of Fig. 3 to describe the resonator, nc6bs Which incident the outer surface very close to the critical angle will undergo approximately 50 reflections in going around the ring. As mentioned, the inside and outside diameters are adjusted such that for the critical angle there will be an integer number of reflections for an integer number of revolutions, the product being N.The primary quantum number, which is the total number of wavelengths involved before the path is repeated, is for this structure on the order of one zillion, yielding a spacing between modes of the order of 250 MHz Cfor a wavelength of 1.3 microns . The index of refraction of silica at this wavelength is about 1.45. According to the theory of Goos and Hanchen, investigated in sane detail by H. K. Lotsche, Beam Displacement a Total Reflection, the G effect, II ,Published in OPTIK, Vol. 32, pp. 189 204 1970 , as a light beam is reflected fran a surface, evenescent waves Extend a distance Z beyond the surface into the adjacent medium. This effect is illustrated in Fig, 4, in which a dense medium 20, having an index of refraction of US is located adjacent a rare med iun 21, having an index of refraction of vr. A light been 25 is incident upon the interior surface 26 of the dense medium 20 at the point 28. If the light been 25 were to reflect at the point 28, it weald follow the dotted line 29 after reflection, back into the dense medium 20.However, according to theGoos Hanchen effect, the beam 25 can be observed to actually penetrate into the rare iraiirn 21 a small distance to appear such that it haa been reflected from a point 30, located at the distance Z perpendicularly measured from the surface 26, It has been found that the distance Z1 for perpendicularly polarized light is Z1 2. sin2 sin2 c And it has been found that the distance Z, for light parallel polarized light is Z. Z1 sin2 c where sin ç r s and c is the critical angle. The distance, D1 , therefore, by which the reflection 35 is offset fran the direct line of reflection dotted line 29 in the perpndicular case is D1 sin sin2 sin2 c And the distance D, for the parallel case is D. D1 sin2 c It can Be seen fran these equations that the penetration of the wave at total internal reflection into the rare meduim is about a wavelength, except for the case of angles close to the critical angle. For this case, very sizable penetrations exist in fact, the depth penetration can be several hundred wavelengths.When several hundred wavelengths penetrate into the rare medium the ring can be optically coupled with a gain medium surrcunding the outsize of the ring. As the gain will obviously be proportional to the coupling between the gain medium and the mode in the ring, modes having large penetration will be favored, for proper design of the ring cirumference , and codes having small or no penetration will be extinguished, Thus, in accordance with the invention, only one single mode having a deep penetration will be excited.As the mode propagates, the effects of diffraction are such as to couple photons out of the mode beyond the critical angle so that tangent rays are seen to escape the mode providing a loss mechanism, and a means for coupling to the structure fran the outside world, as well . The reflection from the inner surface of the ring is well within a critical angle, and the been penetration into this region is about a wavelengthS The portion of the mode volume which is approximately within 100 wavelengths of the surface is strongly excited by the gas laser discharge. me total angular space far discharge is probably about a millimeter ar two in thickness f1000 to 2000 microns thus, the field is expected to couple with fran 5 to 10 percent of the total gas discharge volume. me diffraction angle associated with the mode is about 50 microradians, so one would expect the operable mode to be centered approximately that angular distance inside of the critical angle. As shown in the gray of Fig. 5, the parallel and perpendicularly pc larized beams penetrate fran the silica into the adjacent rare medium approx imately exponentially. lbus, it can be seen fran Figs. 4 and 5 that the parallel polarization mode will be much nme strongly coupled than the ular one. Furthermore, strong mode selection will occur, as approximately a 20 percent change in coupling. coefficient to the discharge occurs within 1 diffraction limit for the mode. It should be noted also that the Goos Hanchen effect leads also to a phase shift at reflection. It has been estmated that far the ring described, that the phase shift rate per revolution is 2 X pi X 357MHz for 50 microrad inns per reflection. If the dimensions of the silica ring 10 are selected so that the angle of incidence is slightly below the critical angle see Fig. 2 , an amount of light will be allowed to escape tangentially from the ring. Because the light does exit tangentially from the ring, an output mechanism can be employed, in the manner illustrated in Fig. 6. As shown, the exiting counter rotating light wavEs are denoted by the reference numbers 40 and 41. A pair of curved mirrors 45 and 46 are located adjacent the silica ring 10 so that the exiting beams fall upon the mirrors 45 and 46 to be reflected onto a beam splitter combiner 48.In this case, the beans are combined by the reflected beans 41 passing the splitter combiner 48 and the reflected beans 40 being reflected fran the Splitter combiner 48, to be directed onto a detector llot shown . Another embodiment of the gyro, in accordance with the invention is shown in Fig. 7. In the embodiment illustrated, an inner chamber 60 is defined between an inner silica cylinder 61 and an outer silica cylinder 63. The inner high purity silica cylinder 61 f ns a resonator structure, as above described, and the chamber 60 adjacent the silica cylinder 61 forms the laser cavity. In the embodiment shown, the chamber 60 may contain a lasing gas, such as a helium neon plasma not shown , or the like. The top and bottan of the cavity 60 are enclosed by silica rings 70 and 71, and located at spaced loca tions along the center radius of the rings 70 and 71 are, respectively, a plurality of anode and cathode elements 73 and 74.Each cathode and anode element has connected to it a series resistor not shown to insure discharge, thereby maintaining the pupping energy to the belium neon plasna within the chamber 60. In the manner described above, the evenscent waves penetrating into the chamber 60 interact with the belium neon plasma in the area 78 to be amplified.The waves within the cylinder 61 which do not penetrate into the chamber 60, including the undesired modes, are extinguished, because there is nothing to support their continuatian in the silica cylinder 61. Thus, the left hard circulating photons within the silica cylinder 61 are indicated by the arrow 80, and the right hand circulating photons are indicated by the arrow 81. For purposes of illustration, the embodiment shown inFig. 7 is constructed so that the light within the resonator ring 61 falls upon the interface between the resonator 61 and the chamber 60 very close to but above the critical angle Csee Fig. 21, thereby experiencing total internal reflection within the resonator structure 61. Compare, for instance, the embodiment of Fig. 6 in which the light within the ring 10 exits the ring tan gentially. To remove the light fran the ring 61, two pick offs 83 and 84 are re spectively provided to remove respective samples of the right anS left hand circulating photons to be processed in conventional manner. The pick offs 83 and 84 operate to intercept the right and left hand energy which is in the evenescent field adjacent the silica ring 61, in accordance with theGoos Hanchen effect, to optically couple the removed energy for detection.
