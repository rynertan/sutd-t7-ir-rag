# Process for the recovery of ethylene oligomers.

## Abstract
A process for the oligomerization of ethylene in which ethylene is contacted in the liquid phase at elevated pressure with a nickel containing oligomerization catalyst in the presence of an aliphatic diol solvent, a liquid hydrocarbon phase containing ethylene oligomers, dissolved ethylene, catalyst, diol solvent and a minor amount of diol solvent decomposition products is recovered under pressure from the resulting reaction mixture, residual amounts of catalyst are removed from the said liquid hydrocarbon phase as a sufficiently elevated pressure to maintain ethylene dissolved therein, dissolved ethylene is separated from the liquid hydrocarbon phase by flashing and the liquid hydrocarbon phase is optionally scrubbed with water, characterized in that the liquid hydrocarbon phase at any point after separation from the solvent phase is contacted with aqueous acid having a pH below 5, and a liquid hydrocarbon phase substantailly free of diol solvent decomposition products is recovered therefrom.
