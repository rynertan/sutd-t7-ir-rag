## Description
A METHOD FOR RE CRYSTALLIZING GYPSUMDESCRIPTIONTechnical FieldThe present invention relates to a method for re crystallizing gypsum to obtain a fine, particulate gypsum in anhydrite form, by reacting the gypsum with sulphuric acid.The object of the invention is to provide a possibility of producing fine, particulate gypsum having a particle size beneath 10 um, preferably beneath 3 um, particularly gypsum in anhydrite form, suitable for use as a filler or as a coating agent in the cellulose industry. In this respect, the gypsum should beof high quality with respect to whiteness.Background ArtThe use of gypsum as a filling agent for paper and other cellulosefibre products for the purpose of reducing the amount of fibre required has been both suggested and tested in the art. Such use, however, requires the gypsum to be in a fine, particulate form, meaning a particle size of 10 um when used as a filler, and a particle size of 3 pom, preferably 1 um when used as a coating agent. Although gypsum can be ground to such particle sizes, large quantities of energy are consumed in so doing.It is also known to re structuralize calcium sulphate which contains water of crystallization to anhydrite form, by heating the gypsum, which may be in hemihydrate or dehydrate form, in sulphuric acid, whereupon the sulphuric acid absorbs the water, to form anhydrite gypsum. There is used in this respect a 70 sulphuric acid, which is permitted to absorb so much water as to be not lower than 40 .The gypsum is therefore moist with sulphuric acid, and change in the original crystal particle size of the gypsum is achieved. SE A 74392 US A 2,021,910 . A similar method for producing gypsum grades containing water of crystallization is disclosed in US A 1,943,497.A method for forming finely divided calcium sulphate is described in FR A 719,903, in which method calcium carbonate is processed with forming sulphuric acid, to produce a finely divided anhydrite gypsum.The Norwegian Patent Specification NO A 54,999 describes a method for producing an extremely fine, and in appearance amorphous, calcium, in which method anhydrite gypsum is heated and mixed with 24X H2S04 at a temperature of 1000C in an amount such that 4 5 grams of SO3 is consumed for every 100 grams of CaS04. The gypsum is therefore moistened with sulphuric acid. The temperature is maintained until the sulphuric acid has been concentrated and the desired transition to the new crystalline structure has taken place.The British Patent Specification GBA 848,617 C DE B 1.118.188 describes a method for producing anhydrite gypsum in pigment form, in which method gypsum having particle size below 200 mesh 75 um is permitted to form a suspension with water 20 25 dry solids content . The suspension is then admixed with concentrated sulphuric acid 74 80 concentration at a temperature of 20 800C, after an initial formation of anhudrite gypsum seeds, whereupon anhudrite gypsum is formed. EP Al 0 012 487 describes a method for producing anhydrite gypsum from dihydrite gypsum by slurrying the latter in 40 65 by weight sulphuric acid at a temperature of 40 90 for from 5 to 30 minutes.The resultant anhydrite gypsum had a particle size of 0.5 3 um. Recrystallization is optionally effected in the presence of multi valent metal ions.EP A2 0 044 120 also describes a method for producing anhydrite gypsum, in which method a given coarse fraction of hydrate gypsum obtained from a wet phosphoric acid process is slurried with concentrated sulphuric acid, to recrystallize the dihydrate gypsum present in the slurry to anhydrite gypsum.A serious disadvantage with these previously known methods is that they fail to eliminate certain particulate, acid insoluble impurities present in the gypsum and deriving from the phosphoric acid manufacturing process, and that these particles remain in the gypsum.Since these particles are black, or at least dark in colour, they impair the quality of the gypsum, particularly when it is to be used as a light pigment or filler.Description of the present inventionIt has now surprisingly been found possible to produce fine, particulate gypsum with a controlled particle size and while eliminating any particulate, acid insoluble impurities present by means of the present invention, which is characterized by heating sulphuric acid having a concentration of at least 35 by weight in water to a temperature of at least 600C, whereafter gypsum, in hemihydrate and or dihydrate form, is dissolved to saturation in an amount equalling at least 100 grams per liter of sulphuric acid solution, whereafter fine, particulate anhydrite gypsum is allowed to precipitate, the gypsum being isolated and dried.Further characteristic features of the invention are set forth in the accompanying claims.With respect to screen analysis, by bringing the gypsum in solution to a high degree of saturation there is obtained an extremely homogenous crystalline fraction. In addition there is obtained a considerable reduction in the volumetric weight of the resultant anhydrite gypsum compared with the weight by volume of the ingoing gypsum, which favours the use of the product as a filler and pigment filler in cellulose fibre material, or as a coating agent for cellulose fibre products. The gypsum has a normal solubility in the aforesaid sulphuric acid solution of less than 10 grams per litreIn general, when carrying out the method according to the invention a 35 sulphuric acid solution is heated to a temperature of 850C, whereafter 400 grams of ot hemihydrate gypsum is dissolved in the solution, this gypsum being, for example, of the kind obtained when manufacturing phosphoric acid in accordance with the wet process mode, i.e. a reaction between sulphuric acid and raw phosphate.Immediately the hemihydrate gypsum dissolves extremely fine, anhydrite gypsum crystals are precipitated, the particle size of these crystals being s um. The sulphuric acid solution is held at 85 C for from 1 to 3 hours, any flourine or phosphorous contaminents present in the gypsum dissolving in the process.When the gypsum dissolves, any dark coloured, acid insoluble impurities present in the raq gypsum immediately fall to the bottom of the vessel in which the gypsum is dissolved, and can be isolated by pouring off the supernatent, or by some other form of separation process, such as in a hydrocyclone for example. The solution of anhydrite gypsum and sulphuric acid is then filtered in a hot state, whereafter the filter cake is washed free from acid solution with warm water. The amount of F and P205 present in the resultant anhydrite gypsum is, in each case, less than 0.3 . The product can be finally dried by calcining the same at a temperature above 2000C, whereupon the solubility of the gypsum further decreases, which increases the retention of the gypsum in a cellulose fibre stock system.When a particularly fine gypsum is required c 3 pm Na ions in the form of NaCl, NaNO3 or Na2S04 are added to the solution of gypsum and sulphuric acid. In this respect, in order to achieve a satisfactory result, the Na ion concentration should be from 0.3 3 mol litre. The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the following working examples, although it will be understood that the invention is not limited thereto.Example 1 250 ml of 35 H2S04 were heated to 850C, whereafter 75 grams of at hemihydrate gypsum obtained from a wet phosphoric acid process were dissolved in the hot acid. The gypsum was dissolved during the first 60 90 minutes, after which time fine, particulate gypsum precipitated. The reaction was terminated after 120 minutes, whereafter the resultant crystalline substance was filter while still hot, washed with warm water to remove any acid present, and then dried. The par ticle size was 3 3um mean particle value according to Counter Colter calculation . The gypsum existed as 100 anhydrite gypsum.Examples 2 29The following fine, particulate gypsums were produced in accordance with Example 1 above. Ex H2SO4 H2SO4 H3P04 H3P04 Temp.

In Examples 2 13 a 95 sulphuric acid was used, the phosphoric acid being a 54 acid so that the amount of water present in the system was the same as in Example 1.Example 30 Oc Hemicalcium sulphate derived from a wetprocess phosphoric plant was added directly after isolation to water in which it was recrystallized to dihydrate calcium sulphate. The calcium sulphate dihydrate was isolated as a filter cake and was added to sulphuric acid in an amount of 400 g per liter of sulphuric acid. The concentration of sulphuric acid being such as after introduction of the wet filter cake the resulting concentration being 40 H2S04. The temperature 0 increased to about 60 C at the addition of the filter cake and was then allowed to decrease to ambient under recrystallization of calcium sulphate anhydrite in particulate form during 90 minutes. The particulate anhydrite gypsum had a particle size of 96 less than 10 pm, whereby 77 per cent thereof had a particle size of between 2 and 6 Sm.
