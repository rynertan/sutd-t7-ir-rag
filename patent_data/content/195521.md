# Hydraulic control apparatus and method of assembly thereof.

## Abstract
The hydraulic control apparatus includes an actuator 18 having an annular body 32 providing an annular piston chamber 41 therein and an annular piston 44 slidably reciprocable on the body, the actuator being pre filled with hydraulic fluid and pre tested prior to being installed on a structure. An annular elastomeric seal 43 is axially reciproc able within the piston chamber to move the piston the construction of the piston being such that a rear end thereof reaches into the piston chamber and abuts against the seal during functioning of the actuator. A movement restraining device 54 is provided for insertion on the body to take the place of the piston, the movement restraining device being constructed so that it is slidable on the body and so that a rear end thereof reaches into the piston chamber and abuts against the seal. The movement restraining device is force fully held on the body, e.g. frictionally, to hold the seal against axial movement while the actuator is filled with hydraulic fluid. It is removed during installation of the actuator, e.g. in a vehicle, and replaced by the piston.
