# Electrochemical prime mover.

## Abstract
A prime mover or motor having one or more compartments in which pressure variations are produced by transporting molecules into and out of the compartment by means of an electrolytic membrane. Devices for converting the pressure changes to mechanical movement are disclosed the devices effect conversion to mechanical motion without adversely affecting the sealed condition of the compartment. The mechanical motion produced by the apparatus of the invention is typically reciprocating linear motion and means are disclosed for converting such motion into a pumping function, a rocking function or a rotating function. Disposed within the compartments is an electrochemically active material that can exist in the gaseous phase and that can enter into an oxidation reduction reaction in order to form ions that move across an electrolytic membrane so as to increase or decrease pressure in a compartment in response to application of a voltage gradient of proper duration and polarity across the membrane. Hydrogen is one suitable material for use in the apparatus.
