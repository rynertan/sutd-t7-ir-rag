# Method and apparatus for selectively charging honeycomb structures.

## Abstract
A mask 20 is disclosed for charging flowable materials into selected cells of a honeycomb structure 21 . The mask comprises a solid body having a number of openings 30 extending therethrough which are spaced to coincide with the open ends of the selected cells exposed at the structure s end face, after the mask is positioned across the end face, the flowable material being charged through the openings 30 . A rigid plate having a number of bores therethrough may be provided for charging a plastically formable plugging mate rial into a honeycomb structure in the fabrication of solid particulate filter bodies and other selectively manifolded structures. As an alternative, a thin transparent polyester film may be attached to an open surface of a honeycomb structure and openings melted therethrough.
