# Electrodynamic device for translating an objective.

## Abstract
An electrodynamic device translates a slide 6 which car ries an objective 1 which is moved along its optical axis 18 by one or more actuator coils 24 by means of drive coils 8 which translate over the supporting rods 9 , the supporting rods forming part of a permanent magnetic circuit comprising stator magnets 7 which produce a permanent magnetic field in the air gaps 12 formed between the supporting rods and the stator magnets. The air gaps are situated in planes parallel to the optical axis of the objective and the actuator coils move in the air gaps, so that the permanent magnetic circuit co operates both with the drive coils of the slide and with the actuator coils of the objective.
