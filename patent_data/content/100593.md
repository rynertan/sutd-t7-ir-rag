# Improved time slot arrangements for local area network systems.

## Abstract
In local area networks LAN s which are required to operate in duplex mode it is necessary for the common communication medium to be operated in a t.d.m. manner. Because the LAN has no common equipment, every station is arranged to contain its own control circuitry and crystal controlled clocking system to produce time slot markers. The system is organised so that each time slot comprises an active period for data or speech transmission or contention resolution, followed by a transit period in which the data or speech reaches the destination. Ideally time slot markers occur simultaneously in both stations and for intermediate stations there is a tolerance which reaches a maximum at the midway point of the network communication medium. The multiplexing system arranges that the time slots are packed as closely together as the delay between most separated stations will allow. The near simultaneous occurrance of time slot markers is maintained by all stations whether busy or free by observing the timing of traffic on the communica tion medium and adjusting the timing of the station time slot marker to occur in the time between data or speech bursts of existing traffic.
