## Description
5 2 HALOGENOVINYL 2 DEOXYURIDINE DERIVATIVES, PROCESSES FOR THEIR PREPARATION, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEMr AND THEIR USE IN TREATING VIRAL INFECTIONS This invention relates to certain deoxyuridine compounds which have antiviral activity. European Published Patent Application No. 61,283 discloses certain mono and di esters of 5 E 2 bromovinyl 2 deoxyuridine which have antiviral activity, particularly against herpes viruses. We have now found a group of novel mono , di and tri substituted 5 2 halogenovinyl 2 deoxyuridines which have antiviral activity, and which are useful in the treatment of infections caused by herpes viruses, such as herpes simplex type 1, herpes simplex type 2 and varicella. According to the present invention there is provided a compound of formula I EMI2.1 wherein each of R1, R2 and R3 is a hydrogen atom, an acyl group, or an optionally acylated 5 E 2 halogenovinyl 2 deoxyuridinylcarbonyl group, or R1 is a 5 E 2 halogenovinyl 2 deoxyuridinylcarbonyl group linked to the 5 oxygen atom via an alkylene carbonyl group having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms in the alkylene moiety, and Y is a halogen atom, preferably a bromine atom, and is identical to the halogen atom in the deoxyuridinylcarbonyl or linked deoxyuridinylcarbonyl group, with the provisos that, a only one of R1, R2 and R3 is an optionally acylated 5 E 2 halogenovinyl 21 deoxyuridinylcarbonyl group, or b R1 is a 5 E 2 halogenovinyl 2 deoxyuridin 5 ylcarbonyl group linked via the alkylene carbonyl group and R2 andR3 are both simultaneously hydrogen atoms. Suitable acyl groups are those of the formula 11 EMI2.2 in which X is an alkyl, aryl or aralkyl group. Suitably X is a C16 alkyl, optionally substituted phenyl or optionally substituted benzyl group. The alkylene moiety in the alkylene carbonyl group may be a straight or branched chain, but is preferably a straight chain. Preferred compounds of formula I are those wherein R2 and R3 are both simultaneously hydrogen. Compounds of formula I wherein R3 and R2 are hydrogen atoms and R1 is a deoxyuridinylcarbonyl group, may be prepared by reacting a compound of formula III EMI3.1 wherein Y is as defined in formula I , with phosgene, suitably in an anhydrous polar organic solvent, such as pyridine. The product may be purified chromatographically on silica gel. Compounds of formula I wherein R3 and R1 are hydrogen atoms, and R2 is a deoxyuridinylcarbonyl group, may be prepared by treating a compound of formula IV EMI4.1 wherein Y is as defined in formula I and Q1 is anO protecting group, with phosgene, suitably in an anhydrous polar organic solvent such as pyridine, and subsequently deprotecting the resulting product. Compounds of formula I wherein R1 and R2 are hydrogen atoms and R3 is a deoxyuridinylcarbonyl group, may be prepared by treating a compound of formula V EMI4.2 wherein Y is as defined in formula I and Q1 and Q2 are O protecting groups, with phosgene, suitably in an anhydrous polar organic solvent such as pyridine, and subsequently deprotecting the resulting product. Preferred O protecting groups are trityl groups, such as 4,4 dimethoxytrityl, or trialkylsilyl groups, such as trimethylsilyl. Deprotection may be carried out by treatment with an acid, such as aqueous acetic acid. Compounds of formulae IV and V wherein Q1 orQ2 are trialkylsilyl groups may be prepared by treating a compound of formula III as defined above with a silylating agent. Suitable silylating agents are trialkylhalosilanes or N, bistrialkylsilylacetamides. Compounds of formula I which are produced by the above reactions with phosgene, may be acylated by treating the products with a suitable acylating agent, preferably an agent of formula VI EMI5.1 wherein X is as defined in formula it , and L is a good leaving group. A preferred acylating agent is an acid anhydride. The acylation reaction will generally produce a mixture of reaction products wherein one or more of R1,R2 and R3 may be an acyl group, and the deoxyuridinylcarbonyl group may itself be substituted by one or more acyl groups. The extent of acylation will depend on a number of factors, such as the relative amounts and chemical natures of reactants, the physical conditions of the reaction, and the solvent system. The mixture can be separated into its pure components by chromatographic methods. A preferred acylation reaction comprises treating a compound of formula I wherein R1 is a 5 E2 halogenovinyl 2 deoxyuridinyl carbonyl group, andR2 and R3 are each hydrogen, with an anhydride of a C1 6 alkanoic acid. This reaction can lead to acylation at the 3 position on the compound of formula I as well as at the 3 position on the deoxyuridinyl carbonyl group. In addition, acylation at the 3 position on the deoxyuridinyl carbonyl group may occur under appropriate conditions. Compounds of formula I in which R1 is a deoxyuridinyl carbonyl group linked via an alkylene carbonyl group, and R2 and R3 are both hydrogen atoms, may be prepared by treating a compound of formula III as defined above with an activated dicarboxylic acid derivative of formula VII EMI6.1 whereintalk represents an alkylene moiety having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, and L is a leaving group, suitably halogen orEMI6.2 where R4 is C1 6 alkyl. The reaction is suitably carried out in an anhydrous polar solvent, such as pyridine, and the product purified chromatographically. The compounds of formula I may be formulated for use in a pharmaceutical composition. Accordingly, in a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of the formula I together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Compositions which may be administered by the oral route to humans may be compounded in the form of syrups, tablets and capsules. When the composition is in the form of a tablet, any pharmaceutical carrier suitable for formulating such solid compositions may be used, for example magnesium stearate, starch, lactose, glucose, rice, flour and chalk. The composition may also be in the form of an ingestible capsule, for example of gelatin, to contain the compound, or in the form of a syrup, a solution or a suspension. Suitable liquid pharmaceutical carriers include ethyl alcohol, glycerine, saline and water to which flavouring or colouring agents may be added. The compounds may also be presented with a sterile liquid carrier for injection. The liquid carrier suitably may be a sterile oil or sterile water. The composition may also be formulated for topical application to the skin or eyes. For topical application to the skin, the compounds of the invention may be made up into a cream, lotion or ointment. These formulations may be conventional formulations well known in the art, for example, as described in standard books of pharmaceutics and cosmetics, such as Harryls Cosmeticology published byLeonard Hill Books and the British Pharmacopaeia. The composition for application to the eyes may be a conventional eye drop composition well known in the art. Preferably, the compositions of this invention are in unit dosage form or in some other form that the patient may administer to himself a single dose. A suitable dosage unit might contain from 50 mg to 1 g of active ingredient, for example 100 to 500 mg. Such doses may be administered 1 to 4 times a day or more usually 2 or 3 times a day. The effective dose of compound depends on the particular compound employed, but is in general in the range of from 1.0 to 20 mg kg of body weight per day or more usually 2.0 to 10 mg kg per day. The present invention further provides a method for treating non human animals or humans suffering from viral infections, which comprises administering to the sufferer a pharmaceutically effective, non toxic amount of a compound of formula I The following Examples illustrate the invention.
