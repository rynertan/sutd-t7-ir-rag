## Description
This invention relates to a novel crystalline zeolite designated herein as ECR 1 and a process for its preparation. In particular, the zeolite has a SiO₂ to Al₂O₃ ratio of from 5 1 to 20 1 and preferably contains a bis 2 hydroxyethyl or a bis 2 hydroxypropyl dimethylammonium cation. The use of quaternary ammonium salts as templates or reaction modifiers in the preparation of synthetic crystalline zeolites, first discovered by R. M. Barrer in 1961, has led to preparation of zeolites with high silica to alumina ratios which are not found in nature. Reviews by Barrer Hydrothermal Chemistry of Zeolites , Academic Press, 1982 and Lok This invention is a novel zeolite which, for purposes of convenience, shall be designated herein as ECR 1. The chemical composition of ECR 1 may be stoichiometrically expressed in terms of mole ratios of oxides as follows The zeolite ECR 1 may be used as a sorbent or as a catalyst, e g., as a hydrocarbon conversion catalyst for, e.g., paraffin isomerization, aromatization, and alkylation or the hydrocracking of lube stocks and fuels. The invention also deals with a method for preparing ECR 1 by the steps of It will be understood that the compositions may contain some waters of hydration the x value above which may be at least partially removed when the zeolites are employed as sorbents or catalysts. In addition, the cations in the zeolite as originally synthesized may be subsequently exchanged with elements from Groups I to VIII of the Periodic Table. The zeolite of this invention is characterized by the x ray powder diffraction pattern given in Table I. The tentative indexing is orthorhombic a 26.3 Å, b 18.3 Å and c 7.3 Å, and may be orthorhombic in other exchanged forms. The morphology of ECR 1 is characteristically long laths or needles with an aspect ratio of about 10 when using the disclosed preparations. Minor variations in the mole ratios of the oxides within the ranges given in the chemical composition for ECR 1 do not substantially alter the structure or properties of the zeolite. In addition, the number of waters of hydration x in the formula will not be the same for each preparation and will depend on the type of exchangeable cation employed and on the degree to which the zeolite is dried. The exchangeable cations which may partially or fully replace the cations found in the assynthesized zeolite ECR 1 in a subsequent ion exchange method may be cations of metals from any one of Groups I to VIII of the Periodic Table or rare earth metals, depending on the end use desired. Preferably, the cations will be mono , di and trivalent metal cations, particularly from Groups I, II or III of the Periodic Table such as barium, calcium, cesium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, strontium, zinc, and the like, or hydrogen or ammonium or alkylammonium ions, or rare earth metals. The presence of these exchangeable cations will generally not cause a substantial alteration of the basic crystal structure of the zeolite. Particularly preferred are mono and divalent cations, as they are more easily included in the pores of the zeolite crystal. Any ion exchange technique may be employed such as those discussed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 3,216,789. A particularly preferred zeolite herein has a composition in terms of mole ratios of oxides in the range A zeolite ECR 1 may be prepared by a process in which a reaction mixture, generally a slurry, is formed comprising an oxide of sodium, water, a tetraalkylammonium salt as discussed above, a source of silica, a source of alumina and sodium zeolite aluminosilicate nucleating seeds. The oxide of sodium may be, e.g., sodium hydroxide, and the tetraalkylammonium salt may be a sulfate, nitrate, phosphate or halide salt, and is preferably a halide such as the chloride, iodide or bromide salt or a hydroxide. The silica is derived from preferably sodium silicate. The alumina may be derived from sources such as, e.g., alumina trihydrate, sodium aluminate, alum, kaolin, metakaolin or the like. It is noted that the sodium oxide may be provided not only directly by adding, e.g., sodium hydroxide to the mixture, but also indirectly from the source of silica and or the source of alumina if, for example, sodium silicate and sodium aluminate prepared by dissolving NaOH and Al₂O₃ 3H₂O in water are respectively employed as at least one of the silica and alumina sources. The preferred source of alumina is an aluminum salt selected from the chloride, sulfate and nitrate salts. The aluminosilicate nucleating seeds which are also required in the reaction mixture, also known as zeolite nucleation centers, consist of a slurry of zeolite solids having the following components SiO₂, Al₂O₃, Na₂O and H₂O. Generally, the seeds should have an average particle size less than about 0.1 microns. The composition of the nucleating seeds in the slurry may be in the approximate ranges, in terms of mole ratios of oxides, as follows The amount of nucleating seeds which should be present in the reaction mixture is expressed in terms of the percentage of the total molar alumina content in the zeolite slurry. Thus, for example, if 5 molar percent of the nucleating seeds is added to the mixture, the seeds are contributing 5 of the total molar amount of alumina in the zeolite slurry. In general, the seeds are present in an amount to yield 0.1 to 20 mole percent of the total alumina content of the slurry, preferably 0.1 to 20 mole percent, and more preferably 2 to 6 mole percent. As an additional requirement, the relative amounts of ingredients in the reaction mixture will be such that the mixture will have a composition, in terms of mole ratios of oxides, within the following ranges where R represents a tetraalkylammonium group as defined above. In one preferred method of preparation a sodium silicate solution, a slurry of nucleating seeds and a bis 2hydroxyethyl dimethylammonium halide solution are added to a blender, followed by slow addition, with mixing, of a sodium aluminate solution and an alum solution. Then additional water is added to the resulting slurry. The reaction mixture is ordinarily prepared in a container made of glass, metal, teflon or the like which should be closed to prevent water loss. After the reaction mixture is formed it is homogenized by thorough blending so as to be substantially homogeneous in texture. This step is to help ensure that the zeolite product ultimately obtained is not a mixture of products. The mixing may take place in any vessel in which complete mixing can be effected. The homogenized mixture is then placed in a reactor, ordinarily one which can withstand elevated pressures such as an autoclave or other pressure reactor, where it is maintained at a temperature of between about 120 and 200 The crystallization time may be shortened, if desired, by seeding the slurry before or after the blending step with minor amounts of zeolite ECR 1 crystals of this invention, which are preferably crushed or chopped at temperatures of about 77 The product zeolite crystals may be recovered by filtration from the reaction mixture. Typically they are washed, preferably with distilled water, to separate them from the mother liquor. The washing should continue, for best purity results, until the wash water, equilibrated with the product, has a pH of between about 9 and 12. After the washing step the zeolite crystals may be dried or calcined if removal of the trapped organic template is desired. Characteristically, the trapped dimethyldiethyl ammonium cation decomposes and evolves from ECR 1 at a temperature of between about 440 The zeolite ECR 1 of this invention may be used as a sorbent or as a catalyst. To be employed for these applications, the zeolite may be at least partially dehydrated by drying at temperatures of up to about 500 The examples which follow illustrate the efficacy of the invention. In all examples, parts and percentages are given by weight and temperatures in degrees Centigrade unless otherwise noted.
