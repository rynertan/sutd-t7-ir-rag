# Pulse detecting circuit of receiver for use in digital radio communication system.

## Abstract
In a pulse detector of a receiver for use in a digital radio communication system comprising a low pass filter 1 supplied with an input signal, a first resistor 4 and a capacitor 6 which are connected in series between an output terminal of the low pass filter and ground to constitute a longer time constant integrating circuit, a second resistor 5 connected in parallel with the first resistor through a switch 7 controlled by a control input c , the first 4 and second 5 resistors and the capacitor 6 constituting a shorter time constant integrating circuit, and a comparator 2 with one input connected to the output of the low pass filter and the other input to a juncture between the first and second resistors and the capacitor, the potential of the juncture being utilized as a reference potential of the comparator, there is provided a switch 12 connected between the juncture and the ground in series with the capacitor. According to this invention, pulse detection can be made more accurately and power can be much more saved than a prior art pulse detecting circuit.
