Transl. , 7, 1674 1677 1971 and The Chemistry of FunctionalGroups, Supplement D Patai and Rappoport, editors , JohnWiley and Sons, Ltd., 1983. For example, those compounds of formula I wherein R1is EMI4.1 and A is oxygen may be prepared by the following procedure. Malonic acid is reacted with the necessary Rê, R3 substituted ketone in the presence of a strong acid catalyst such as sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid to form the desired malonate this reaction is illustrated by the following reaction sequence EMI4.2 The malonate is then reacted with X substituted iodosobenzene in an inert organic solvent such as chloroform, dichloromethane or 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethylene this reaction is illustrated by the following reaction sequence EMI5.1 Similarly, the other compounds represented by formula I wherein R1 is as defined above may be prepared in an analogous manner as, for example, by the reaction of the desired X substituted iodosobenzene with a 1,3 dicarbonyl cyclic or acyclic compound.For instance, for those compounds of formula I wherein R1is EMI5.2 and A is methylene and R2 and R3 are as defined above the desired R2, R3 substituted 3,5 diketocyclohexane is reacted with X substituted iodosobenzene in an inert organic solvent such as chloroform this reaction is illustrated by the following reaction sequence EMI5.3 It has heretofore been unknown that the compounds of formula I, can be used in valuable antimicrobial applications i.e., as a bactericide, fungicide or algaecide .For example, the compounds of formula I or compositions containing one or more of them as the active antimicrobial constituent can be incorporated into or upon plaster, ink, wallboard, textiles, paper, adhesives, soaps, synthetic detergents, cutting oils, polymeric materials, embalming fluids, oil base paints, latex paints and any other aqueous based system in order to prevent the attack of various microbial pests and thus avoid the resultant economic loss due to the degradation of such products by the microorganisms. Also the compounds can be distributed in textiles, cellulosic materials or in grain or can be employed in the impregnation of wood and lumber to preserve and protect such products from the attack of the organisms of rot, mold and decay. A preferred antimicrobial application for the compounds of formula I includes incorporation into various latexes such as adhesives, textiles, paints, papers and the like which may be subject to microbiological contamination and or deterioration. Similarly, another preferred antimicrobial application for the compounds of formula I is as a preservative in metalworking fluids. Still another preferred antimicrobial application for the compounds of formula I is in the prevention of slime accumulation in water cooling towers.These compounds typically have low minimum inhibitory concentrations against aqueous borne biofoulants often found in industrial cooling towers such as, for example,Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter aerogenes. Further, the compounds typically exhibit good hydrolytic stability half life of days to months and are thus persistent in aqueous media. Because of the low concentrations needed to inhibit slime buildup in this environment, subsequent degradation products will also be present in low concentrations. Especially preferred for use in the water cooling tower application described above is the compound o nitrophenylisopropylidenemalonyliodone.

Amer. Chem. Soc., 70, 3426 1948 iso propylidene malonate was prepared as follows Malonic acid 26.08 g was mixed with acetic anhydride 31 ml and then 1.58 g of concentrated sulfuric acid was added whereupon some of the malonic acid dissolved.The resultant mixture was cooled in an ice bath and 21 ml of acetone was added with stirring keeping the temperature below 200C. The solution was cooled to about OOC for about 4 days during which time a yellow color developed and the solution froze. During the 4 day period, the frozen mixture was occasionally thawed, stirred, and allowed to refreeze. After the 4 dap period, a solid was recovered from the cold mixture. The solid was washed with 250 ml of ice cold water about 30 50C and allowed to dry in air to give 21.11 g of white crystalline isopropylidene malonate. The isopropylidene malonate should preferably be stored under refrigeration. Example 4 o NitrophenylisopropylidenemalonyliodoneEMI9.1 To a mixture of isopropylidene malonate 0.917 g in 20 ml of chloroform was added in small increments initially 1.78 g of o nitroiodosobenzene.This mixture was then stirred for about 15 minutes resulting in a precipitate which was collected by filtration. The precipi Late was washed with diethyl ether and then dried leaving 1.88 g of a light yellow powder identified as o nitrophenylisopropylidenemalonyliodone, m.p. 166 168 C. Example 5 p Nitroiodosobenzene Dichloride Condensed chlorine gas was added dropwise for 10 minutes to a cold approximately 300C mixture of 20 g of p nitroiodobenzene in 300 ml of chloroform resulting in the formation of fine yellow crystals which were recovered by filtration. After prolonged cooling of the above mixture, an additional crop of crystals was obtained by filtration. Based on the melting point and known method of preparation, the product 22.09 g was identified as p nitroiodosobenzene dichloride, m.p. 1480C. Example 6 p Nitroiodosobenzene A mixture of p nitroiodobenzene 5.00 g and acetonitrile about 45 ml was treated with condensed chlorine gas 3 ml to give p nitroiodosobenzene dichloride as fine yellow crystals. The p nitroiodosobenzene dichloride 3.83 g was thoroughly ground with 90 ml of concentrated aqueous sodium hydroxide solution added in three 30 ml portions to give a bright orange paste which was collected. The collected material was washed with water, filtered, and then washed with chloroform, filtered, and allowed to dry in air for several hours to give 3.03 g of a yellow solid m.p. 87 C, exploded identified as p nitroiodosobenzene.Example 7 p Chloroiodosobenzene Acetate A cold 0 10 C solution consisting of p chloroiodobenzene 24.91 g in 150 ml of chloroform was treated with condensed chlorine gas and a bright yellow precipitate, p chloroiodosobenzene dichloride, formed. After stirring the above mixture for 15 minutes, the p chloroiodosobenzene dichloride was isolated by filtration. The p chloroiodosobenzene dichloride was then dissolved in glacial acetic acid 150 ml and this mixture cooled to near freezing and then treated with 200 ml of a solution of lead acetate 39.63 g in glacial acetic acid. After one half hour of vigorous stirring, the reaction mixture was filtered to remove lead chloride , and the filtrate was poured onto about 500 g of cracked ice.The resultant aqueous mixture was extracted four times with 400 ml portions of dichloromethane. The dichloromethane extracts were combined and this dichloromethane solution was washed three times with 300 ml portions of water, dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to dryness to give 17.70 g of p chloroiodosobenzene diacetate.Example 8 p Methoxyiodosobenzene Acetate Condensed chlorine gas 5 ml was added to a solution of p methoxyiodobenzene about 6 g in 100 ml of chloroform. A bright yellow solid, p methoxyiodosobenzene dichloride, precipitated. The p methoxyiodosobenzene dichloride product was quickly filtered from the reaction mixture and was not allowed to dry to prevent decomposition . The chloroform damp product was quickly added to a solution of lead acetate 16.42 g in 130 ml of glacial acetic acid and stirred. After the reaction mixture had been stirred for two hours, the lead chloride which had formed was removed by filtration and washed with acetic acid 50 ml .The acetic acid wash was combined with the reaction mixture filtrate i.e., the reaction mixture from which the lead chloride was removed and this mixture was poured onto about 500 g of cracked ice which resulted in the formation of a precipitate. The precipitate was recovered by filtration and air dried to give 1.33 g of white, crude p methoxyiodosobenzene diacetate m.p. 740 810C . After removal of the p methoxyiodosobenzene acetate that had precipitated, the filtrate an aqueous acetic acid chloroform mixture was extracted with dichloromethane six times with 200 ml portions . The dichloromethane extracts were combined then dried over magnesium sulfate and then concentrated giving an oil.The oil was subjected to continuous Soxhlet extraction for 43 hours with a solution of acetone 30 ml and n hexane 150 ml . A powder was formed in the extraction thimble which was filtered and dried to give 5.93 g of p methoxyiodosobenzene diacetate, m.p. 82 83.5 C. Example 9 PhenyldimedonyliodoneEMI12.1 10.00 Grams of iodosobenzene diacetate prepared in a manner analogous to that described herein and 4.35 g of dimedone i.e., l,l dimethyl 3,5 diketocyclo hexane were stirred for 30 minutes in 250 ml of dichloromethane. This reaction mixture was then washed three times with 100 ml portions of 5 percent aqueous sodium hydroxide. The organic layer was then washed three times with 100 ml portions of a saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulfate, and the dichloromethane was then evaporated leaving a white, flaky1 amorphous solid. The solid was vigorously stirred with diethyl ether, and dried to give 8.13 g of phenyldimedonyliodone, m.p. 128.50 129.50C. Example 10 p MethoxyphenyldimedonyliodoneEMI12.2 A cold 00C mixture of p methoxyiodosobenzene diacetate 6.0 g and dimedone 2.40 g in 75 ml of chloroform was stirred for one half hour, then warmed to room temperature and stirred for an additional 1.5 hours. The mixture was then evaporated to dryness at approximately 300C, aspirator vacuum and the residue was triturated with diethyl ether 100 ml to give 4.76 g of a white powder after filtration m.p. 147 1510C . The resultant white powder was dissolved in chloroform 30 ml and then diethyl ether was added 100 ml . Upon slow evaporation, a slurry was obtained which was filtered, and 3.42 g of a precipitate recovered. The precipitate was identified as p methoxyphenyldimedonyliodone, m.p. 1450 147 C. Example 11 p NitrophenyldimedonyliodoneEMI13.1 Dimedone i.60 g and p nitroiodosobenzene 3.03 g were added to 20 ml of chloroform, and the resulting mixture was stirred overnight. A precipitate formed which was isolated by filtration giving 2.22 g of a white flaky solid after air drying m.p. 1300 1310C . Diethyl ether 60 ml was added to the filtrate and a white, flaky precipitate formed which was isolated and dried 1.17 g m.p. 1300 1310C . The white solids were combined and subjected to continuous extraction with diethyl ether to give 2.96 g of p nitrophenyldimedonyliodone m.p. 1300 1310C . Example 12 p ChlorophenyldimedonyliodoneEMI14.1 Dimedone 6.95 g was added to a slurry of p chloroiodosobenzene diacetate 17.70 g in 100 ml of dichloromethane. After stirring for one half hour, the mixture gelled. The gelled mixture was filtered to give an amorphous solid. The solid was washed three times with 100 ml portions of dichloromethane to give 15.72 g of a white, flaky solid, identified as p chlorophenyldimedonyliodone, m.p. 1570 158 C. Example 13 p BromophenyldimedonyliodoneEMI14.2 A solution of 50.95 g of p bromoiodobenzene in 150 ml of chloroform was treated with condensed chlorine gas which gave a fine yellow precipitate of p bromoiodosobenzene dichloride. The p bromoiodosobenzene dichloride precipitate was removed by filtration and washed with cold chloroform. To a cold OOC solution of the p bromoiodosobenzene dichloride in 900 ml of acetonitrile was added 166.92 g of silver acetate. After a few minutes, the silver chloride which precipitated was removed by filtration and the filtrate was concentrated to a slurry. The slurry was then dissolved in 1000 ml of chloroform, filtered, and 25.33 g of dimedone added. After about 15 minutes a white precipitate formed in the mixture and the mixture was then cooled at OOC for 24 hours. After the cooling period, the precipitate was recovered by filtration and 29.66 g of a white flaky solid was recovered. The white flaky solid was washed three times with 200 ml portions of chloroform and then dried. Diethyl ether 200 ml was added to the filtrate which precipitated an additional quantity 18.36 g of white, flaky material. The combined precipitates were identified as p bromophenyldimedonyliodone, m.p. 1610 1620C.Analysis Calculated for C14H14BrIO2 C, 39.94 H, 3.35 I, 30.14 Found C, 39.78 H, 3.43 I, 29.97Example 14 PhenyldibenzoylmethyliodoneEMI15.1 Potassium hydroxide 17.0 g in 500 ml of methanol was cooled in an ice bath to 00 50C and dibenzoylmethane 22.4 g was added. Iodosobenzene diacetate 32.2 g was slowly added to the cold mixture. After stirring for one hour, 500 ml of an ice water mixture was slowly added to promote crystal formation. The resultant crystal crop was washed with two 100 ml portions of methanol and then rinsed with diethyl ether. The resultant solid was dissolved in chloroform and reprecipitated with petroleum ether to give 20.0 g 23.5 yield of dark yellow crystalline phenyldibenzoylmethyliodone, m p 85 88 C. Example 15 p BiphenylyldimedonyliodoneEMI16.1 p Iodobiphenyl 10.0 g was dissolved in 100 ml chloroform. As the chloroform solution was cooled to Dry Ice acetone temperature, chlorine gas was bubbled into the solution. After a few minutes of treatment with a steady stream of chlorine gas, the resultant yellow solution was allowed to warm to room temperature. To promote crystal growth, the sides of the flask were scratched with a sharp unpolished glass rod and a fine yellow precipitate formed which was isolated by filtration. The crystals were dried in air to give 10.3 g of p biphenylyliodosodichloride. The p biphenylyliodosodichloride was added to a mixture consisting of 2.08 g dimedone and 125 ml chloroform. After about 10 minutes of stirring, 20 ml of aqueous dilute sodium hydroxide solution was added.A clear chloroform layer and a clear aqueous layer formed after stirring for a few minutes. The chloroform layer was separated, which upon subsequent treatment with hexanes gave an off white precipitate which was recoverd by filtration and dried in air to give 2.31 g of p biphenylyldimedonyliodone, m.p. 1470 148 C. The antimicrobial activity of the compounds of formula I was demonstrated by the following techniques. The minimum inhibitory concentration MIC for the compound of Example 4 i.e., o nitrophenylisopropylidenemalonyliodone was determined for 9 bacteria using nutrient agar and 5 yeast and fungi using malt yeast agar . A one percent solution of this test compound i.e., the compound of Example 4 was prepared in a mixture of acetone water. Nutrient agar was prepared at pH 6.8 using deionized water according to standardDifco procedures. Malt yeast agar was prepared by adding 3 g Bacto yeast extract and 45 g Bacto Malt agar per liter of deionized water.The agar nutrient agar when testing with bacteria and malt yeast agar when testing with yeast and fungi was dispensed in 30 ml aliquots into 25 x 200 millimeter mm test tubes, capped and autoclaved for 15 minutes at 115 C. The test tubes containing the agar were cooled in a water bath until the temperature of the agar was 480C and then an appropriate amount of the one percent solution of the test compound was added except in the controls where no test compound was added to the respective test tubes so that final concentrations of 500, 250, 100, 50, 25, 10, 5, 2.5, 1.0 and 0 parts per million ppm of the test compound in the agar were obtained. The agar solutions were each mixed and poured into individual petrie plates so that each petrie plate contained agar having a known concentration of test compound dispersed therein. After drying for 24 hours, the petrie plates were inoculated with bacteria when the petrie plates contained nutrient broth agar or with fungi and yeast when the petrie plates containing malt yeast agar. The inoculation with bacteria was accomplished using the following procedure. Twenty four hour cultures of each of the bacteria were prepared by incubating the respective bacteria in tubes containing nutrient broth for 24 hours at 300C in a shaker. Dilutions of each of the 24 hour cultures were made so that 9 separate suspensions one for each of the 9 test bacteria were made, each containing 108 colony forming units CFU per ml of suspension of a particular bacteria. Aliquots of 0.3 ml of each of the above suspensions were used to fill individual wells of a Steer s Replicator. For each microbial suspension, 0.3 ml was used to fill 3 wells i.e., 3 wells of 0.3 ml each so that for the 9 different bacteria 27 wells were filled. The Steer sReplicator was then used to inoculate the petrie plates. The petrie plates were incubated at 300C for 48 hours and then read to determine if the test compound i.e., the compound of Example 4 which was incorporated into the agar prevented growth of the respective bacteria.The minimum inhibitory concentration MIC for each bacteria was defined as the lowest concentration of the test compound which prevented growth of that bacteria. The inoculation with the fungi and yeast was accomplished as follows. Cultures of fungi and yeast were incubated for 7 days on malt yeast agar at 30 C. These cultures were used to prepare suspensions by the following procedure. A suspension of each organism was prepared by adding 10 ml of sterile saline and 10 microliters p1 of TritonX100 to the slant. The sterile saline Triton X100 solution was then agitated with a sterile swab to suspend the microorganism grown on the slant. Each resulting suspension was diluted into sterile saline 1 part suspension 9 parts sterile saline . Aliquots of these dilutions were placed in individual wells of a Steer s Replicator and petrie plates inoculated as previously described. The petrie plates were incubated at 300C and read after 48 hours for yeast and 72 hours for fungi.

Their effectiveness varies with the concentration of compound employed and the organism to be controlled. While not all compounds are effective at similar concentrations against the same organisms, all compounds of the present invention are useful in the antimicrobial method disclosed herein. Examples of the bacteria and fungi controlled by effective amounts of one or more of the compounds of formula I are organisms such as Bacillus subtilis,Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes,Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans. As used herein, the term effective amount refers to that amount of one or more of the compounds of formula I needed to exhibit either static or cidal effects on selected organisms. Typically, this amount varies from 1 to 2000 parts per million ppm by weight depending upon the particular compound tested and organism treated. In the protection and preservation of inks, adhesives, soaps, plaster, wallboard, cutting oils, textiles, polymeric materials and paper, good results are obtained when the compounds are incorporated in such products in the amount of at least 0.001 percent by weight. In the preservation of wood, excellent results are obtained when the compounds are incorporated, by conventional treatment of the wood, in the amount of at least 0.01 pound per cubic foot 0.16 kg cubic meter of wood. In the preservation and protection of oil and latex paints and primers against destruction caused by the growth of bacteria or fungi, the compounds of the present invention are preferably employed at concentrations of at least 0.001 percent by weight. In such operations, an effective amount of the unmodified compounds are distributed or incorporated in adhesives, soaps1 inks, wallboard, cutting oils, textiles, paper, polymeric materials, paint, lumber, wood products or growth media. However, the present method also embraces the employment of liquid or dust compositions containing the compounds. In such usage, the compounds are modified with one or a plurality of additaments or adjuvants including water, organic solvents, petroleum oils, petroleum distillates, or other liquid carriers, polymeric thickening agents, urea, surface active dispersing agents and finely divided inert solids.Depending upon the concentration of the compounds used in the compositions, such augmented compositions are adapted to be distributed in inks, adhesives, soaps, cutting oils, polymeric materials, paints, textiles, wallboard, paper, lumber or soil or upon the above ground surfaces of plants, or to be employed as concentrates and subsequently diluted with additional liquid or solid carriers to produce the ultimate treating compositions. In compositions wherein the adjuvant is a finely divided solid, a surface active agent or the combination of a surface active agent and a liquid diluent, the carrier cooperates with the active component so as to facilitate the invention and to obtain an improved result. The exact concentration of one or more of the compounds of formula I to be employed in the treating compositions is not critical and may vary considerably provided the required dosage of the effective agent is supplied in the ink, adhesive, soap, cutting oil, polymeric material, paint, textile, paper, wood or growth medium. The concentration of said compounds in liquid compositions generally is from 0.0001 to 3 percent by weight. Concentrations up to 10 percent by weight may be employed. In dusts, the concentrations of the compounds can be from 0.0001 to 95 percent by weight. In compositions to be employed as concentrates, the compounds of formula I can be present in a concentration of from 0.01 to 98 percent by weight.The quantity of treating composition to be applied to textiles, lumber, growth media and the like may vary considerably provided that the required dosage of active ingredients is applied in sufficient amounts of the finished composition to adequately facilitate the penetration and distribution of said ingredients in and on, for example, textiles, lumber and growth media. In the treatment of lumber, from 1 to 100 gallons of solvent composition containing one or more of the compounds of formula I is usually applied per 1,000 square feet 1 to 100 liters 24.543 square meters of surface to be treated. In the pressure or vacuum treatment of lumber, sufficient composition is employed adequately to impregnate the wood. In the preparation of dust compositions, one or more of the compounds of formula I can be admixed with any of the finely divided solids, such as pyrophyllite, talc, chalk and gypsum. In such operations, the finely divided carrier is ground or mixed with the said compounds or wet with a solution of the compounds in a volatile organic solvent. Similarly, dust compositions containing the products can be prepared using various solid surface active dispersing agents such as fullers earth, bentonite, attapulgite and other clays.Depending upon the proportions of ingredients, these dust compositions can be employed for the control of pests or employed as concentrates and subsequently diluted with an additional solid surface active dispersing agent or with pyrophyllite, chalk, talc, gypsum and the like to obtain the desired amount of active ingredient in a composition adapted to be employed as described herein. Also, such dust compositions when employed as concentrates can be dispersed in water, with or without the aid of dispersing agents to form spray mixtures. Further, spray compositions can be prepared by incorporating one or more of the compounds of formula I, or their liquid or dust concentrate compositions, in mixtures with surface active dispersing agents such as an ionic or non ionic emulsifying agent. Such spray compositions are readily employed for the control of microbes or are dispersed in liquid carriers to form diluted sprays containing the compounds in any desired amount suitable for microbial control. The choice of dispersing agents and amounts thereof employed are determined by the ability of the agents to facilitate the dispersion of the concentrate in the liquid carrier to produce the desired spray compositions. Similarly, the compounds of formula I can be admixed with a suitable water immiscible organic liquid and a surface active dispersing agent to produce an emulsifiable concentrate which can be further diluted with water and oil to form spray mixtures in the form of oil in water emulsions. In such compositions, the carrier comprises an aqueous emulsion, i.e., a mixture of water immiscible solvent, emulsifying agent and water. Preferred dispersing agents which can be employed in these compositions are oil soluble and include the non ionic emulsifiers such as the condensation products of alkylene oxides with the inorganic acids, polyoxyethylene derivatives or sorbitan esters, complex ether alcohols and the like.Suitable organic liquids which can be employed in the composition include petroleum oils and distillates, toluene, liquid halohydrocarbons and synthetic organic oils. The surface active dispersing agents are usually employed in liquid compositions in the amount of from 0.1 to 20 percent by weight of the combined weight of the dispersing agent and active compound. In addition, other liquid compositions containing the desired amount of one or more of the compounds of formula I can be prepared by dissolving said compounds in an organic liquid such as acetone, methylene chloride, chlorobenzene and petroleum distillates. The preferred organic solvent carriers are those which are adapted to accomplish the penetration and impregnation of the environment to be treated. In further embodiments, the compounds as employed in accordance with the present invention, or compositions containing the same, can be advantageously employed in the methods described herein in combination with one or more pesticidal or preservative compounds. In such embodiment, such pesticidal or preservative compound is employed either as a supplemental active constituent, an additament or as an adjuvant. Representative pesticidal or preservative compounds include the substituted phenols, cresols, substituted cresols and their metal salts, the bisphenols and thiobisphenols, the halogenated salicylanilides, the organosulfur compounds, the carbamate compounds, the quaternary ammonium compounds, the organometallic compounds, the inorganic salts and miscellaneous other compounds.
