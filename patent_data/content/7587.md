# Encapsulated Hall effect device.

## Abstract
An encapsulated Hall effect device is constructed on a thin substrate 20 with an aperture 25 . A semi conductor chip 30 having a plurality of connection leads 34,35 and including a Hall effect element having a sensing surface 38 is disposed in registration with the aperture 25 . Encapsulation material 40 surrounds the chip 30 and aperture 25 . The encapsulation material 40 comprises a nonmagnetic portion 42 which surrounds the sensing surface 38 of the chip 30 and a magnetically active portion 44 which surrounds the surface of the chip 30 opposite the sensing surface 38 , with both portions 42,44 together fully enclosing the chip 30 .
