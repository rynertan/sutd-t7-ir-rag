## Description
Ventilation device for drving brickeThe invention has as its subject a ventilation device for drying bricks utilizable, in particular, in drying chambers where the bricks are stacked in superposed rows on a number of parallel frames.Ventilation devices are ourrently used in the aforementioned drying chambers which are made to slide, in the two directions, in the corridor existing between two facing frames on which there are superposed rows of bricks and these, by contributing to an increase in the relative velocity between the hot air and the article to be dried, guarantee a faster drying of the said bricks.One problem derived from the use of the said devices consists in obtaining the most uniform possible drying of the bricks arranged on opposite sides with respect to the device itself,In this connection various systems have been employed to date, amongst which, for example, a large fan, of a diameter at least equal to the height of the pair of facing frames that accept the bricks, supported by a carriage movable parallel in the two directions, in which the rotation direction of the impeller is reversed either when changing from one direction of movement to the opposite one, or in accordance with predetermined intervals of time, so as to ensure the same ventilation conditions since there is a difference existing between the delivery and the aspiration of the air for the articles to be dried.This method is not devoid of problems due, above all, to down times occasioned by the acceleration and deceleration time needed for inversions in the rotation rirection. Another method comprises a number of fans, of a small diameter, placed vertically one on the other and fixed to a vertical stanchion which is turned by a rack, when hitting against corresponding fixed linit devices paced at the enrt reltles of the path followed b the carriage that carries the said fans, through 180 thereby directing the flow of air from the fans which in this method rotate constantly in one and the sane direction alternately towards the fac ing rows of bricks arranged on the said franes.This method requires, however, the rack coupling member to be oversized in order to prevent in from breaking where the limit knock takes place and, therefore, at the very tine rotation starts, because o the considerable inertia of the masses that are moving.The object of the present invention is, therefore, to overcome the aforementioned difficulties through the construction of a ventilation device, in particular for drying bricks, which allows the rotation and orientation of the ventilation element or elements at the nost suitable angle and, contem poraneously, the said position to be stably kept, not only in the region of the extremities but also along the path followed by the said device, and this by neans of mechanical methods that are extremely inple and are also financially advantageous , above all in relation to the results obtained therewith. this and other objects too are attained with the device in question comprising a stanchion supporting one or nore vent ilation elements, characterized by the fact that it comprises a first frame integral with the said stanchion, resting, through clutch means, on a second frame integral with a carriage movable, alternately in the two directions, longitudin ally along the corridor existing between two facing frames on which there are a number of superposed rows of bricks, and rotatable, rlth respect to he said second frame, aro ma vertical spindle a rotation ara integral, at one extrem ity, with the lower part of the said vertical spindle, the free extremity thereof beings provided with a projection placed at a level lower than the horizontal plane defined by the lower free extremity of the said spindle and means for gliding and interceptlng the said projection, placed beneath the sai second frame and at least in proximity of the travel extremity of the said carriage. he said guide means can, when necessary, be placed along the whole path followed by the carriage or even partially , in such a way as to bring about a continuous regulation of the direction of the ventilation flow on the bricks to be dried.A further advantage of the device in question lies in the fact that the bricks at both extremities of the frames receive the ventilation one In the region of the travel extremities of the carriage, the stanchion, in fact, always rotates 1800 in the sane direction, and this is something that was not achieved with the devices tb at preceded the present inventionFurther characteristics and advantages of the invention will become more obvious from the detailed description that follows of one preferred form of embodiment, illustrated as an unlimited example on the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 shows, diagrammatically iul an axial section, the device forming the subject of the invention Figs. 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d and 2e show, diagrammatically in plan view form, the device according to Fig 1 in the various phases of rotation of the ventilation elements.With reference to the accompanying figures, at 1 there is a vertical stanchion with which one or more fans 2 are integral the actual number depending upon the height of the frances 3 and 4 that contain the bricks to be dried, see Fig. 2 , fixed to te upper part of a horizontal disk 5 belonging to a first frame, and resting, with the lower surface 6, via a clutch member 7, on the horizontal upper surface 8 of a second frame, shown generally at 9, the upper part of which integral with a carriage 10 novable alternately, in the two directions shown with the arrows 11 and 12, in the corridor existing between the two facing frames 3 and 4, parallel thereto.The rotation of the vertical stanchion 1 around the vertical axis y y is achieved through a spindle 13, coaxial to the disk 5, and is guided by a pair of bearings 14 placed in the inside of the cylindrical body of the frame 9. The said spindle 13 projects out of the frame 9 and the lower part extends underneath the carriage 10 and has, integral with its extremity, an arm 15 which, in turn, is provided at the free extremity thereof with a roller 16 placed at a level lower than that of the horizontal plane defined by the lower extremity of the said spindle 13. Shown globally at 17 there is a set of rotating contacts rings connected to sliding brushes te allow an electrical connection between the second frame fixed and the first rotatable frame in order to supply the fans. In Fig. 2a two guides, 20 and 21, in this specific instance shaped as shown are placed at the two extremities of the path followed by the carriage 10 in order to intercept the roller 16. The said guides slope with respect to the direction in which the carriage travels and extend on opposite sides with respect to the line x x defined by the movement of the axis of the spindle 13. The said guides are interspaced at a distance at least identical to the diameter of the said roller, so as to allow this to pass. vhe operation of the device forming the subject of the invention will now be described with particular reference toFigs. 2a, b, c and d, as well as to the elements constituted by the guides 20 and 21 and by the arm 15.Assuming now that the configuration corresponds to Fig. 2a in which the carriage 10, and with it the whole ventilation device, is moving in the direction indicated by the arrow 11 with the flow of air hitting the superposed rows of bricks placed on the frame shovm at 3, the arm 13 will be positioned perpendicularly with respect to the aforementioned axis x x until the roller 16 arrives flush up against the initial section 20a of the first guide 20 and thus gives the arm 15, and consequently the complete stanchion 1 integral there with, a clockwise rotation see Fig. 2b .Proceeding in this manner the carriage limit configuration 2c is reached, and this corresponds to a 900 rotation of the arm 15 in which the said carriage hits against a microswitch not shown in the figure which reverses the motion thereof and carries the roller 16 to move the arm 15 flush up against the second guide 21 at an obtuse angle seeFig. 2d which leads to a continuation of the rotation of the arm 15 again in a clockwise direction for a further 900 to a point corresponding to where the said roller has its exit 25 from the said guide 21 see Fig. 2e . In this connection it is necessary, in order that this be possible, that the distance the extremity 25 of the guide is away from the axis x x be identical to the length of the arm 15 since otherwise a rotation of 90O would not take place.In this way, through the presence of the two guides 20 and 21, a total rotation is thus achieved of the stanchion and, in consequence, of the fans through 1800, such, that is to say, as to hit, as the carriage 10 moves in the direction indicated by the arrow 12, the frame shown at 4, and at the end of the said travel a further pair of guides attends to returning the ventilation device to the configuration as per Fig. 2a. should be noted that the stated succession of phases is made possible not only by the presenee of the said guides but, above all, by the presence of the clutch member which allows the first frame to rotate with respect to the second frame and the said position to be stably maintained until there is a fresh reaction on the part of the arm 15. In its practical form of embodlaent, the invention can also adopt forms differing from what has been described above and, in particular, numerous modifications of a practical nature may be made, just as the guides 20 and 21 may be of a curvilinear conformation in such a way as to globally achieve a rotation of 1800 on the part of the stanchion 1 even though the individual rotations may not be 90a, without i y way deviating from the framework of protection afforded to the invention.
