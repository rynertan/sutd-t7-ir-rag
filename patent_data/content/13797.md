# Oxidation of alcohols and aldehydes using a ruthenate catalyst.

## Abstract
Organic substrates are oxidised by adding them to an aqueous solution containing a catalyst comprising the anion RuO₄ ² in the presence of an oxidising agent, such as an aqueous alkaline persulphate solution. The so used catalyst is produced by adding ruthenium trihalide to an aqueous solution of the oxidising agent.

## Description
Oxidation of Organic Substances Using a Ruthenate Catalyst This invention relates to the oxidation of organic.substrates and in particular provides a novel reagent for the oxidation, under mild conditions, of primary and secondary alcohols and aldehydes. Certain organic substrates, that is to say, molecules or functional groups, may be oxidised using, as oxidising agent, either osmium tetroxide or ruthenium tetroxide and these reagents, if used in the presence of a suitable secondary oxidising agent, are catalytic in action in that the said secondary oxidising agent oxidises in situ the reduced form of the osmium or ruthenium tetroxide produced as a result of the oxidation of the substrate organic molecule or functional group, thus regenerating the osmium or ruthenium tetroxide.. Examples of organic substrates which may be oxidised by osmium tetroxide or ruthenium tetroxide are primary and secondary alcohols, alkenes, alkynes and ethers.Neither osmium tetroxide nor ruthenium tetroxide, however, is an easy reagent to use with safety and they are both in any case unsuitable reagents or catalysts for certain reactions since they are not selective in activity. For example, unsaturated alcohols cannot be oxidised to the corresponding unsaturated acids by means of asmium tetrcr ide or ruthenium tetroxide because the unsaturated carbon carbond bond is oxidised as well as the alcohol group. We have now found that these disadvantages may be overcome by the use as catalyst of the ruthenium VI ion RuO4 2 in the presence of a secondary oxidising agent.We have also found that certain specific oxidation reactions may be carried out using as catalyst the ruthenium VI ion RuO4 in the presence of a secondary oxidising agent. According to a first aspect of the invention, a process for the oxidation of an organic substrate comprises adding the organic sub strate to an aqueous solution containing a catalyst comprising the anion RuO4 2 in the presence of an oxidising agent. The purpose of the said oxidising agent is to regenerate the ruthenate ion Ru04 2 from a reduced form produced as a result of reaction with the organic substrate preferably the oxidising agent is also used to generate the ruthenate ion in the first instance, so that the RuO4 2 anion is produced in situ in the reaction mixture. According to a second aspect of the invention, a process for the manufacture of a catalyst suitable for use in the oxidation of organic substrates comprises adding ruthenium trihalide to an aqueous solution of an oxidising agent.Spectrophotometric measurements on such solutions show that all ruthenium is present as RuO4 2, no RuO4 or RuO4 being detected. We have found that the preferred trihalide or ruthenium is the trichloride and the preferred oxidising agent is aqueous alkaline persulphate solution, for example potassium persulphate in potassium hydroxide. This oxidsing agent will not oxidise organic substrates that the catalyst of the invention will cause to oxidise, which lead us to believe that the persulphate ion functions not only as a generator of Ru4 2 from ruthenium trichloride but also as a secondary oxidising agent to regenerate the Ru04 2 ion from the reduced form produced as a result of the oxidation of the organic substrate. The catalysts used in the process of the present invention catalyse the oxidation of organic substrates under mild conditions, for example at room temperature in air, with a molar ratio of substrate RuO4 2of and preferably 45 1, reaction generally being complete within a few hours. Typical substrates that are catalytically oxidised by the process of the first aspect of the invention include primary and secondary alcohols and aldehydes.Tertiary alcohols and unsaturated substrates such as alkenes and alkynes are substantially unaffected by the catalyst so that, for example, cinnamyl alcohol C 65 CH CHCH2OH and 3 cyclohexene l methanol are catalytically oxidised to the corresponding carboxylic acids in high yields. We have found that other specific reactions may be carried out, for example by using a lower molar ratio of substrute ruthenate of about 10 1 and a longer reaction time of about 24 hours, benzylamine is oxidised to benzonitrile as the main product. The following table shows some examples of the process according to the invention. Experiments were carried out at room temperature in air using a catalytic solution containing 1.7xlO 4M ruthenate in potassium persulphate 3xlO 2M and potassium hydroxide 2xlO 1M at a substrate RuO4 ê ratio generally of approximately 45 1.
