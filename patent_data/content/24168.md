# Article of furniture such as a display case or storage cabinet.

## Abstract
Articles of furniture such as showcases, desks, etc. are formed using side members 13, 15 and leg members 11 joined at corner structures, the side members defining an opening for receiving a panel such as a glass pane 28 , each side member having an elongate, lipped channel which receives a retaining member 50 for holding the panel. Each retaining member has a flange portion 51 which is longitud inally slidable into engagement with the lipped channel, a surface 52 which abuts the side member and an upstanding wall 53 to engage the panel edge. In one form the wall has an edge arranged to overlie the panel, preventing the panel from being lifted out of the opening in a direction normal to its plane. Interconnecting structures 46, 47 and trim strips 49 usable with the structure are also disclosed.
