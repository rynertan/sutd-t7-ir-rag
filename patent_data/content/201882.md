## Description
FISH PROLACTIN POLYPEPTIDE AND DERIVATIVES THEREOF The present invention relates to a DNA coding for a fish prolactin polypeptide, for example, the prolactin polypeptide of Oncorhynchus keta, or a derivative thereof, a recombinant DNA wherein said DNA is incorporated, a microorganism containing the recombinant DNA and a process for the production of the fish prolactin polypeptide 6r a derivative thereof using the microorganism. The fish prolactin and its derivatives have the effect of stimulating the growth of fish. It is known that adult Oncorhynchus keta has adaptability to fresh water from the fact that when it is put in fresh water osmotic pressure of its plasma slightly decreases after 24 hours and is kept at a constant level thereafter. Prolactin seems to have an important role in adaptation of Oncorhynchus keta to fresh water because the concentration of prolactin in blood increases significantly after 24 hours coincidentally with the decrease of osmotic pressure. Mammalian prolactins are produced in the pituitary gland. The activity and structure of the mammalian prolactins are known. For example, human prolactin has been reported inEndocrinology 71, 209 1962 by J. B. Josimovich, et al., and in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 58, 2307 1967 by L. M.Sherwood, et al. As for fish prolactin, there have been some reports on the isolation thereof, examples of which are given below. Isolation from tilapias S. W. Farmer, et al., Gen. Comp. Endocrin., 31, 60 71 1977 Isolation from salmons D. R. Idler, et al., Gen. Comp. Endocrin., 35, 409 418 1978 Isolation from carp T.B. Ng, et al., Gen. Comp. Endocrin., 42, 141 146 1980 Isolation from teleosts H. Kawauchi, et al., Gen. Comp. Endocrin., 49, 446 458 1983 On the other hand, as for mammalian prolactin genes, rat prolactin gene N. E. Cooke, et al., J. Biol. Chem.255 13 , 6502 1980 , bovine prolactin gene J. H. Nilson, et al., Nucleic Acids Res., 8 7 , 1561. 1980 and human prolactin gene N. E. Cooke, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 256 8 , 4007 1981 are already known. A fish prolactin gene has not been reported yet. Fish prolactins have the effect of stimulating the growth of fish and the effect of adjusting the adaptability of fish to fresh water, and thus are useful as a component of baits for fish cultivation. The amount of the prolactin provided by the recovery from the fish pituitary gland is limited. Therefore, it has been desired that a process for providing a large amount of fish prolactin at a low cost is developed. The present inventors studied a method of producing fish prolactins by recombinant DNA techniques. As the result, the present inventors have successfully recovered a DNA complementary to a fish prolactin polypeptide and a derivative thereof which are usable in the production of the fish prolactin polypeptide and a derivative thereof, and produced a recombinant DNA and a microorganism containing the DNA. That is, a messenger RNA mRNA was extracted from the pituitary gland of Oncorhynchus keta and a DNA cDNA complementary to the mRNA was synthesized. Then, a DNA probe corresponding to the amino acid sequence around the N terminal of the prolactin of Oncorhvnchus keta was synthesized and a gene of the prolactin of Oncorhvnchus keta was cloned by selecting a cDNA which hybridized with the DNA probe. Then, the whole base sequence of the cDNA of the gene was determined. The present inventors have further studied and found that a large amount of prolactin of Oncorhvnchus keta is formed and accumulated in a medium by culturing a microorganism containing a recombinant DNA wherein a DNA coding for the prolactin of Oncorhynchus keta is incorporated.Further, the present inventors have studied and found that a large amount of a prolactin polypeptide derivative ofOncorhvnchus keta is formed and accumulated in a medium by culturing a microorganism containing a recombinant DNA wherein a DNA coding for the prolactin polypeptide derivative ofOncorhvnchus keta is incorporated. Fig. 1 1 and 2 are flow sheets for synthesizing cDNA by the method of Okayama Berg and constructing a recombinant plasmid containing the DNA. Fig. 2 illustrates the restriction enzyme map of the cDNA in pSPRLl. Fig. 3 is a flow sheet for constructing the recombinant plasmids pSPRLA6 and pSPRtBl. Fig. 4 is a flow sheet for constructing plasmids pSPRLQ28 and pSPRLQ52. Fig. 5 is a flow sheet for constructing plasmid pTrS20. The present invention provides a fish prolactin polypeptide, for example, the polypeptide having the peptide sequence as illustrated in Table 1 and a derivative thereof.The polypeptide can be produced by recombinant DNA techniques in the following manner. That is, an mRNA of fish prolactin is used as a template to prepare a DNA cDNA complementary to the mRNA, and then a recombinant plasmid wherein the cDNA or a derivative thereof is incorporated is prepared. Further, the recombinant plasmid is incorporated in a host microorganism.The DNA and recombinant plasmid can be used for amplification of a prolactin gene or a derivative thereof in bacteria such as Escherichia coli. Microorganisms carrying the recombinant plasmid are useful for producing a large amount of fish prolactin polypeptide and derivatives thereof at low cost. Thus, the present invention provides a DNA coding for a fish prolactin polypeptide or a derivative thereof, a recombinant DNA wherein the DNA is incorporated, a microorganism containing the recombinant DNA and a process for producing the fish prolactin polypeptide and the derivative using the microorganism. The DNA and recombinant plasmid of the present invention are prepared the following general method. Whole RNA is prepared from the pituitary gland ofOncorhvnchus keta and passed through an oligo dT cellulose column to isolate RNA having polyadenylic acid poly A poly A RNA . A double stranded DNA is synthesized using the poly A RNA as a template and a reverse transcriptase. A recombinant is obtained using in vitro recombinant DNA techniques by inserting the synthe tic DNA into a vector DNA such as Escherichia coli plasmid DNA. A recombinant plasmid having the DNA complementary to the prolactin mRNA ofOncorhvnchus keta is selected based on the marker carried on the plasmid. A DNA coding for a fish prolactin polypeptide derivative is obtained by treating the DNA coding for the fish prolactin polypeptide with an enzyme. The DNA is inserted into a vector DNA to obtain a recombinant DNA and the recombinant DNA is incorporated into a microorganism to obtain a transformant. A fish prolactin polypeptide derivative is obtained by culturing the transformant. A process for producing the DNA and recombinant plasmid of the present invention is explained in detail below. The pituitary gland is excised from capturedOncorhynchus keta and immediately freezed in a liquid nitrogen.. Guanidium isothiocyanate is added to the freezed pituitary gland and the pituitary gland is disrupted and solubilized. Then, the solubilized pituitary gland is put onCsCl solution layer and subjected to ultra centrifugation to obtain whole cytoplasmic RNA as a precipitate. Alternatively,LiCl is added to the solubilized matter with guanidium isothiocyanate to recover only RNA as a precipitate. The extracted RNA is dissolved in an NaCl or KC1 hypertonic solution for example 0.5M and passed through an oligo dT cellulose clumn to allow mRNA having poly A to be adsorbed on the column. Solution is carried out with water or a hypotonic salt solution such as 10 mM Tris HCl buffer to isolate the mRNA having poly A . Synthesis of cDNA and insertion of the cDNA into a vector are carried out according to the method of Okayama Berg Okayama Berg Mol. Cell. Biol. 2, 161 1982 as described below. First, a vector primer is synthesized. A vector, e.g. pCDVl, is treated with KpnI in an adequate solution such as a solution consisting of Tris HCl buffer e.g. pH 7.5, 10 mM , MgC12 e.g. 6 mM and NaC1 e.g. 10 mM to cut pCDVl at KpnI site. The DNA is incubated with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase at an appropriate temperature e.g. 370C for an appropriate period e.g. 20 minutes in a solution consisting of Tris HCl buffer e.g. pH 6.8, 30 mM , sodium cacodylata e.g. 140 mM , CaC12 e.g. 1 mM , dithiothreitol e.g. 0.1 mM and dTTP e.g. 0.25 mM to add about 60 thymidyl residues to both 3 ends of the vector DNA. Then, the DNA is cut with EcoRI in a solution consisting ofTris HCl buffer e.g. pH 7.5, 10 mM , MgC12 e.g. 6 mM andNaCl e.g. 100 mM . The digested solution is fractionated by low gelling temperature agarose gel electrophoresis LarsWieslander Analytical Biochemistry, 98, 305 1979 , hereinafter referred to as LGT method to recover a DNA fragment of about 3.1 Kb. Then, the DNA is dissolved in anNaCl or KC1 hypertonic solution e.g. 0.5M and passed through a poly dA cellulose column to allow only vector primer molecules having poly T to be adsorbed on the column.Elution is carried out with water or a hypotonic salt solution such as 10 mM Tris HC1 buffer to isolate only the vector primer molecules with poly T . Then, a linker DNA is synthesized in the following manner. For example, ptl DNA is treated with PstI in an appropriate solution such as a solution consisting of Tris HCl buffer e.g. pH 7.5, 10 mM , MgC12 e.g. 6 mM and NaC1 e.g. 50 mM to cut ptl at PstI site. The DNA is treated by the same method as in the synthesis of the vector primer except that dGTP is added in place of dTTP, and oligo dG chains about 15 mer are added. The DNA is cut with HindIll in an appropriate solution such as a solution consisting of Tris HCl buffer e.g. pH 7.5, 10 mM , MgCl2 e.g. 6 mM andNaCl e.g. 60 mM .A DNA fragment of about 0.5 Kb is fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis and recovered withDEAE paper. Thus, a linker DNA is obtained. The thus obtained poly A RNA, vector primer and linker DNA are used to synthesize cDNA in the following manner. The poly A RNA and vector primer DNA are reacted with a reverse transcriptase at an appropriate temperature e.g.370C for an appropriate period e.g. 40 minutes in a solution consisting of Tris HCl buffer e.g. pH 8.3, 50 mM , MgC12 e.g. 8 mM , KC1 e.g. 30 mM , dithiothreitol e.g. 0.3 mM , and dATP, dTTP, dCTP and dGTP e.g. 2 mM each . Oligo dC chains about 15 mer are added to the 3 ends of the thus obtained RNA DNA double stranded chain under the same conditions as in the case of the addition of dT chains to the vector primer except that dTTP is replaced with dCTP. The DNA is cut with HindIII in a solution consisting of Tris HCl buffer e.g. pH 7.5, 10 mM , MgC12 e.g. 6 mM and NaCl e.g.60 mM . The previously prepared linker DNA is mixed with theDNA and the mixture is incubated with Escherichia coli DNA ligase at an appropriate temperature e.g. 120C for an appropriate period e.g. 16 hours in a solution consisting of Tris HCl buffer e.g. pH 7.5, 20 mM , MgC12 e.g. 4 mM , NH4 2S04 e.g. 10 mM , KC1 e.g. O.1M and ss nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ss NAD e.g. 0.1 mM to prepare a ring of the cDNA and linker DNA. To the reaction solution are added 40 uM final concentration each dATP, dTTP, dGTP and dCTP.Escherichia coli DNA ligase, Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and Escherichia coli ribonuclease H are added to replace the RNA part with DNA and to obtain a recombinant plasmid containing a complete double stranded cDNA. An Escherichia coli strain, e.g. Escherichia coli c600SF8 is transformed with the thus obtained recombinant plasmid, for example, by the method of Scott, et al. KatsuyaShigesada Saibo Kogaku Cell Engineering , 2, 616 1983 .Since an ampicillin resistance gene exists in the recombinant plasmid mentioned above, the Escherichia coli transformant is resistant to ampicillin. Selection of a microorganism strain carrying a new recombinant plasmid DNA having a gene complementary to the mRNA of fish prolactin from the ampicillin resistant ApR strains is generally carried out in the following manner.That is, the transformants obtained above are fixed on.a nitrocellulose filter and a synthetic DNA probe having a DNA sequence which is presumed from the amino acid sequence of a known prolactin of Oncorhynchus keta is hybridized thereto to select the transformant showing strong hybridizaion the method of Grunstein Hogness, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA., 72, 3961 1975 . The probe DNA is synthesized by a conventional triester method J. Am. Chem. Soc., 97, 7327 1975 .Selection by the synthesized DNA probe is more definitely carried out by the method of Southern, et al. J. Mol. Biol., 98, 503 1975 and a recombinant plasmid DNA having the gene complementary to Oncorhvnchus keta prolactin mRNA is identified by the same method. pSPRtl is an example of the thus obtained recombinant plasmids. The plasmid can be used as a source of the DNA coding for prolactin of Oncorhynchus keta. The DNA coding for prolactin of Oncorhvnchus keta is cut out from the plasmid carrying the DNA and inserted into a vector DNA. The thus obtained recombinant DNA is incorporated in a microorganism and the obtained transformant is cultured to accumulate a prolactin polypeptide of Oncorhvnchus keta in a medium, which is then recovered. In this manner, the prolactin polypeptide of Oncorhvnchus keta can be produced. As the plasmid containing the DNA coding for prolactin of Oncorhvnchus keta, pSPRLl mentioned above is preferably used. Plasmid pSPRnl can be recovered fromEscherichia coli ESPRL1 FERM BP 776 containing the plasmid by the method of Birnboim Nucleic Acids Res. 7, 1513 1979 1. A DNA coding for a prolactin polypeptide derivative is obtained by treating the DNA coding for prolactin ofOncorhynchus keta with an enzyme. Plasmid pSPRL1 is used as a source of the DNA coding for prolactin of Oncorhvnchus keta. As the vector DNA, any vector can be used so long as the DNA incorporated therein can be expressed in a microorganism. Preferably, a vector DNA wherein a DNA can be inserted downstream from a suitable promoter such as tryptophan trp promoter, lactose lac promoter or PL promoter and the length between Shine Dalgarno sequence referred to as SD sequence hereinafter and initiation codon ATG is adjusted, for example, to 6 18 base pairs is employed. Preferred examples of the vector DNA are pGEfll, pTrS20 Japanese Patent Appliction No. 23319 86 and pKYP26. pGEL1 is a plasmid as illustrated in Fig. 3 and Escherichia coli containing the plasmid was deposited with the Fermentation Research Institute, Agency of Industrial Science and Technology hereinafter referred to as FRI as Escherichia coli IGEL1 under From BP 629 on October 6, 1984. Plasmid pTrS20 is obtained according to the method described in Reference Example 1. A microorganism containing plasi pKYP26 was deposited with the FRI as Escherichia coli IkYP 26 FERM BP 3 on August 8, 1985. Plasmid pKYP26 can be obtained from scherichia coli IKYP26 FERM BP 863 containing the plasmid 5 the method of Birnboim. Recombination of the DNA coding for the polypeptide and the vector DNA can be carried out by a conventional recombinant DNA techniques wherein both DNAs are digested with restriction enzymes and relegated with T4 DNA lipase. In the case of pSPRL and pGELL given as an example two step construction is carried out as illustrated in Fig. 3.That is, Hae11 HindIII digestion fragment coding for the vicinity of the N terminal of mature prolactin peptide ofOncorhynchus keta and EindITI BanIII digestion fragment containing remaining cDNA and the vector part are separately prepared from pSPRL1.

The plasmid has a construction wherein a region coding for mature prolactin of Oncorhvnchus keta is ligated downstream from the tryptophan promoter. In the case of prolactin polypeptide derivative, a recombinant plasmid is obtained by the following method. Plasmid pSP.RLl is subjected to cleavage wit KpnI, digestion wit Bal31 and cleavage with BamHI to obtain a DNA fragment containing a DNA codig for prolactin polypeptide. Separately, pKYP26 is cleaved with BamHI and PstI to obtain a DNA fragment of about 1,700 bp containing lpp terminator region. Plasmid pTrS20 is subjected to cleavage with SacI, formation of a flush end with DNA polymerase I and cleavage with PstI to obtain a DNA fragment of about 1,000 bp containing trp promoter. The thus obtained DNAs are combined and a recombinant plasmid is prepared using T4 DNA ligase.Escherichia coli HBl0l is transformed with the recombinant plasmic.

The structure of the thus obtained plasmid was confirmed by cleavage with EcoRI, BanIII, HindlIl, SacI andNruI and agarose gel electrophoresis. The plasmid was named pTrS20 Fig. 5 . It was confirmed by the method of Sanger using M13 phage that the nucleotide sequence around the BanIII and HindIII sites of pTrS20 was as follows.EMI31.1 tb SEP Banili SEP HindIII SEP SacI SEP NruI tb SD tb seauence SEP CCATA SEP Met SEP l SEP CGA tb AAGG SEP GTAT SEP e SEP to SEP AGCTT SEP ATG tb
