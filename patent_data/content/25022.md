# Detector device for overcurrents and the loss of one or two phases.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a device that detects overcur rents and the loss of one or two phases occurring suddenly in the supply line 2 of electrically operated means M. In both cases the aforementioned detection is followed by the said means being disconnected from the electricity mains. The phase loss is detected when, in one or two phases of the line 2, the current Ia, Ib, Ic therein is below, for a predeter mined period of time, an established value. The overcurrent detection takes place when a line current exceeds, for a predetermined period of time, a threshold value Is. In one form of embodiment, the device trips immediately in another it operates with a time lag that is a function of the ratio K between the line overcurrent and the threshold value Is, and it again becomes non operative when the overcurrent ceases, as a function of the said ratio K.
