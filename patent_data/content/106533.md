# MAGNETIC HEAD ASSEMBLY HAVING IMPROVED READ WRITE CHARACTERISTICS FOR A FLOPPY DISC

## Abstract
A magnetic head assembly having a read and write magnetic transducing assembly 390 with a gap 406 for recording a track of data having a first width on a moving magnetic media 160 and an erase magnetic transducing assembly 392 located adjacent said read and write magne tic transducing assembly 390 . The erase magnetic trans ducing assembly includes a pair of erase cores 394, 396 each having two core portions 412, 414 which each terminate in end sections positioned with one end section of each core portion adjacent each other to define an erase gap 426 and with the other end sections of each core portion terminating in end edges which are spaced from each other to define an opening therebetween. The pair of erase cores 394, 396 are positioned in spaced, substantially parallel relationship to each other with a predetermined distance therebetween which is less than said first width. The erase gaps 426 are located on each side of the recording gap to erase a portion of the edge of each recorded track of data having a first width to produce a recorded track of data on a said magnetic media having a track width substantially equal to said predetermined distance. An erase coil 424 encloses two spaced parallel aligned other end sections of one core portions 414,416 of each erase core 394,396 with the end edges thereof extending slightly beyond the erase coil 424 . A back bar 420 having a first end 430 and a second end 432 , is positioned across the opening with said first end 430 contiguous each of said end edges of the two spaced parallel aligned other end sections 414, 416 . The second end 432 is contiguous the other two spaced parallel aligned other end sections of the other core portion of each erase core to form a closed low reluctance path.
