# New compounds containing quaternary ammonium and methylenephosphonic acid groups.

## Abstract
Compounds having improved properties of inhibiting the precipitation of metal ions when used in threshold amounts have been made which are derivatives of ammonia or di or polyamines in which the amine hydrogens have been substituted with both methylene phosphonic acid groups or their salts and hydroxypropyl quaternaryammo nium halide groups. Thus, ammonia can have two hyd rogens replaced with methylenephosphonic groups while the third is replaced with a hydroxypropyltrimethylammo nium chloride group and three hydrogens of ethylene diamine can be replaced with methylenephosphonic groups, the fourth being replaced with a hydroxypropyltrimethylam monium chloride group.
