# Winding apparatus with means for automatically exchanging tubes.

## Abstract
A winding apparatus for continuous filaments with axially movable chucks 8, 9 for the bobbin tubes. The chucks are pivotably arranged on a rotatable disc 2 and can be brought into contact first with a central and non displaceable accelerating ring 28 and then with a rotating friction drive drum 30 . The disc 2 has openings 6, 7 through which the pivotable bobbin chucks 8, 9 penetrate.
