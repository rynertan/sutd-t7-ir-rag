# Thermochromic liquid crystal displays.

## Abstract
A thermochromic liquid crystal display comprises a layer of short pitch cholesteric liquid crystal material 5 between two walls 2,3. An absorber 6 covers the back of the rear walls. At least one wall is surface profiled with a fine grating 7 to align the liquid crystal material. Typically the grating pitch is 0.05 to 12 µm. The profile may be fine on one wall e.g. to 12 µm pitch, 0.1 depth and coarse e.g. 125 µm pitch groove width 100 µm, depth 10 µm, on the other wall. The cholesteric pitch is arran ged to give the desired a selective reflection of light whereby the display is observed to change colour with temperature. Using thin flexible walls small displays may be cut from large sheets of embossed polyester plastic material.
