# RECORDING SYSTEM FOR RECORDING DATA ON TAPE IN A DISK RECORDING FORMAT

## Abstract
A system for recording data in a stream on a recording tape in the same format that data is recorded in concentric tracks on a recording disk. The system includes a read write transducer head for reading said tape or recording or eras ing thereon transport apparatus for transporting the tape past the transducer head to cause the head to access a stream on the tape a first sensor for sensing a beginning of stream indicator on the tape a second sensor coupled to the transport means for sensing the length of tape trans ported past the transducer head a first controller coupled to the first sensor for providing an initial beginning of seg ment index pulse in response to the first sensor sensing the beginning of stream indicator and further coupled to the second sensor when in a formatting mode for providing end of segment index pulses followed by additional begin ning of segment index pulses as a function of the length of tape transported past the transducer head following each beginning of segment index pulse and a second controller coupled to the first controller for responding to each begin ning of segment index pulse when in a formatting mode by providing a recording segment signal to the transducer head for formatting a recorded stream of segments on the tape. Each segment includes a first fill field, followed by a predetermined number of sectors including identifying ad dresses and data, followed by a second fill field until an end of segment index pulse is provided by the first con troller. The segment length is equivalent to the length of a concentric track on a recording disk.
