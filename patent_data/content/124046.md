# Operational mode responsive heating arrangement for internal combustion engine induction system.

## Abstract
In an engine system wherein the engine coolant is permit ted to boil and the gaseous coolant used as a vehicle for remov ing heat from the engine, a heating jacket associated with the induction conduit of the engine is supplied with gaseous coo lant via a control valve during cold engine starts and during modes of engine operation wherein it is advantageous from the view point of fuel economy to raise the temperature of the engine and or the incoming fuel charge. The supply is termi nated under other modes of operation to avoid heating the in coming charge and reducing charging efficiency.
