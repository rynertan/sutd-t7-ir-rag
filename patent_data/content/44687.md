# Noise elimination circuit in a magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
In a magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus in which a frequency modulated video signal and a frequency modulated audio signal are frequency multiplexed and the frequency multiplexed signal is recorded on video tracks of a magnetic tape 1 , and the recorded signal is reproduced, a noise produced in the audio signal due to video track switching in the signal reproduction is eliminated by holding the audio signal for a period of noise duration.
