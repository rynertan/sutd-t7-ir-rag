# Prerecorded tapes, data storage and retrieval system for use therewith, and methods of storing and retrieving binary data words.

## Abstract
A system for formatting data on video tape for high accuracy recovery in which binary data is recorded on the video signal track of video tape in a prearranged format of three redundant blocks of data words between successive vertical sync pulses. Each redundant block of data words is preceded by a set of at least three redundant sync words and the last block of data words is followed by a fourth set of redundant sync words. The redundant sync words in each set are separated from each other by a plurality of blank horizontal sync pulse intervals. Circuitry for recovering data in this format is disclosed together with a system for writing data in this format.
