# Postal scale with weight to period transducer.

## Abstract
A scale especially useful in automated mailing includes a directly loaded weight to period transducer which provides an oscillatory output the period of which varies as a function of the weight to be measured. The transducer includes a disc 40,44 of piezoelectrically active material bonded to an inac tive substrate base 42 which dishes at its center in response to the weight to be measured. The transducer frequency out put is processed to provide a digital period signal. A reference oscillator having matched temperature characteristics gener ates a high frequency count calibrated for scaling the trans ducer period to a weight count. The high frequency signal and the period signal are gated to provide an input to a counter which generates a digital weight information signal. The weight information signal may be transmitted to a postage mailing system processor for use in determining the postage requisite for mailing the article.
