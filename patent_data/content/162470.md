# A method for controlling the fuel supply of an internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
There is a method for controlling the fuel supply of an internal combustion engine having a throttle valve in the intake air system. It is detected that an angular position of a crankshaft of the engine coincides with a predetermined crankshaft angular position. Whenever this coincidence is detected, the pressure in the intake air passage downstream of the throttle valve and the engine rotating speed or the value of the inverse number thereof is detected on the basis of the interval between the detections of the crankshaft an gular position. The reference basic fuel supply amount into the engine is determined in accordance with the present de tection value P
