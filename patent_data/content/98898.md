# Device for fixing rods in selected relative positions.

## Abstract
A device for clamping two axially telescoping rods in a selected telescoped position, includes a case 4 supported at the end of the outside one 1 of the two rods 1, 2 and the case 4 encloses an annular bush 3 wrapped around the inside one 2 of the two rods 1, 2 . One side of the bush 3 is open for defining an axial gap. Terminal flanges 3a extend away from the bush 3 at opposite sides of the gap. A shaft extends from the second of the terminal portions, through the first of the terminal portions and then outside the case 4 . A two position cam 6 is journaled to the shaft and is shaped to engage the exterior of the case 4 . As the cam 6 is moved between its two positions, it selectively draws the terminal portion flanges 3a together or permits them to move part for selectively clamping or releasing the bush 3 on the rod 2 . A spring normally biases the terminal portion flanges 3a apart. A nut 12 screw threaded received on the shaft 7 is adjustable along the shaft for defining the initial position of the second terminal portion with respect to the first terminal portion.
