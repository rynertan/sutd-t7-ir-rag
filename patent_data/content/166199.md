# Recording disc and a method for fabricating same.

## Abstract
A recording disc comprises a substrate having a track ing servo groove of spiral or concentric pattern on one surface thereof. The servo groove has a constant depth and a variable width which varies to allow generation of a posi tion indicating signal. An eraseable recording layer is de posited on the surface of the substrate to store information signals. The recording disc is fabricated by a method involv ing modulating the intensity of a laser beam with a per manently stored signal and directing it to the surface of a photoresist layer on a master blank placed on a rotating turntable. The beam penetrates the full thickness of the layer. The optically excited portion of the layer spreads in lateral directions by an amount proportional to the energy. The turntable is moved relative to the laser to expose a portion of the photoresist layer in spiral or concentric pat tern to the directed beam. The exposed portion is then etched to form the tracking servo groove, A replica of the groove is then form on a substrate followed by the deposi tion of a radiation sensitive layer on the substrate.
