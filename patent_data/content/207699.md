## Description
The present invention relates to a light emitting element, and particularly to a light emitting element such as a light emitting diode or a semiconductor laser having a multiquantum well structure in the light emitting region. Conventional semiconductor lasers and light emitting diodes hereinafter referred to as LED s have been realized with a structure consisting of a pn junction of the same material or with a single heterostructure or a double heterostructure in which one side of the pn junction or both sides of the light emitting region active region are constituted by a material having a high energy bandgap. In order to increase the efficiency of radiative recombination in the light emitting region of the semiconductor laser or the LED, there has recently been proposed a multiquantum well structure in which quantum well layers or active layers composed of a material having a lower energy bandgap are sandwiched by barrier layers or confinement layers composed of a material having a higher energy bandgap in the light emitting region, as disclosed in Electronics Letters , Vol. 19, No. 6, March 17, 1983. Objects that may be achievable by preferred embodiments of the invention include the following to provide a light emitting element, particularly a semiconductor laser, a light emitting diode, or the like, having a high light generation efficiency to provide a semiconductor laser or a light emitting diode having a high light generation efficiency and a low threshold current, and to realize a light source that can be adapted to lightwave communications, optical discs and facsimiles. The present invention deals with a semiconductor light emitting device, e.g. a laser or a light emitting diode, having a multiquantum well structure constituted by compound semiconductor layers, wherein the quantum well width which con stitutes the quantum well or the energy difference barrier height between a barrier layer and a quan tum well layer, is so selected that the highest level among the quantum levels in the quantum well is not brought into agreement with the energy level uppermost end of the valence band or lowermost end of the conduction band of the barrier layer. There fore carrier injection into the quantum well may be promoted, and there may be obtained a semiconductor laser having a very small threshold current and a high differential quantum efficiency. No close study has yet been made concerning the effect of the quantum well width upon the light gen eration efficiency in a semiconductor laser device which has multiquantum well structure, except a re port concerning a GRIN SCH semiconductor laser preparatory document for the lecture on applied physics, spring 1985 by Yagi et al. . The present inventors have made experiments and a thorough study, and have found the fact that when a laser active region is constituted in which thin GaAs active layers are respectively sandwitched by GaAlAs confinements re gions in an Al That is, by forming the quantum well having a particular width, there can be obtained a semicon ductor laser device which permits a very small thresh old current to flow and which exhibits a high differ ential quantum efficiency. The inventors have examined threshold currents by varying the width of quantum well over a region of 10 to 200 angstroms as described above, and have found the fact that the threshold current decreases sin gularly at the above mentioned quantum well widths with x values of x 0.1, 0.3 and 0.4 threshold currents of when x 0.2 are not shown, to sim plify the drawing as shown in Fig. 1 When x 0.5 which establishes an indirect transition semiconductor region, the threshold current decreases periodically in the same manner as mentioned above. The threshold current, however, decreases in amounts smaller than those of the direct transition region of up to about x 0.4. Relying upon the above mentioned phenomenon, the present invention deals with a semiconductor laser device having multiquantum well structure which employs a compound semiconductor, wherein the quantum well width which constitutes the quantum well or the energy difference barrier height between a barrier layer and a quantum well layer, is so selected that the highest level among the quantum levels in the quantum well is not brought into agreement with the energy level of the barrier layer, so that the carrier injection into the quantum well is promoted, the threshold current is greatly reduced, and that the differential quantum efficiency increases. The present invention further provides an LED which employs the multiquantum well structure in the light emitting region, the LED having a quantum well width of an optimum light generation efficiency. Fig. 3 shows the dependency of photoluminescence PL intensity I The invention will now be described in detail by way of embodiments. Fig. 2 is a section view which illustrates a semiconductor laser device according to an embodiment of the present invention, wherein Fig. 2 a is a diagram showing the whole device, and Fig. 2 b is a diagram showing an encircled portion thereof on an enlarged scale. As shown in Figs. 2 a and 2 b , on a 100 n GaAs substrate doped with silicon at a concentration of about 2 x 10¹⁸ cm ³ 1 are grown as n GaAs buffer layer 0.5 µm thick, n type im purity concentration of 2 x 10¹⁸ cm ³ 2, an n Al When the GaAs quantum well width is selected to be 50 angstroms or 90 angstroms that is, deviated from optimum values of 32 5, 74 10, 110 10, and 160 10 angstroms , the threshold current density increases to larger than 900 A cm². Further, the semiconductor laser device having the quantum well width of 72 angstroms of this embodiment exhibits a differential quantum efficiency which is increased by about 10 compared with other semiconductor laser devices having quantum well widths of 50 angstroms and 90 angstroms. According to this embodiment as described above, the threshold current can be de creased and the differential quantum efficiency can be increased. If an optimum quantum well width is selected as described above, substantially the same effects can be exhibited even with the laser device of any other stripe structure such as graded index type laser, buried heterostructure laser, and the like lasers. Though the above embodiment has employed mate rials of the AlGaAs GaAs type, the same effects can also be obtained by selecting such a quantum well width that increases the carrier injection into the quantum well layer even when materials of other compound semiconductor types are used such as Al According to the semiconductor laser device having, as an active region, multiquantum well struc ture which employs compound semiconductors of the present invention as described above, the quantum well width which constitutes the quantum well or the energy difference between a barrier layer and a quan tum well layer, is so selected that the highest level among the quantum levels in the quantum well is not brought into agreement with the energy level of the barrier, so that the energy level of electrons and holes formed in the quantum well helps promote the carrier injection into the quantum well regardless of the barrier height. Therefore, there can be fab ricated a quantum well type semiconductor laser which permits a greatly reduced threshold current to flow and which exhibits a quantum efficiency that is in creased by about 10 . Fig. 5 illustrates the structure of an LED according to the present invention, wherein reference numeral 11 denotes an ohmic contact electrode of the n type side, 12 denotes an n type GaAs substrate, and 13 denotes an n type Al The LED produces an optical output of 1.5 mW when the drive current is 50 mA. The output of 1.5 mW is about 1.5 times as great as that of the LED of the same structure but which does not have an optimum well width. According to the present invention, a multi quantum well type LED can be fabricated having a quantum well width which produces the greatest light generation efficiency, the LED being driven on a small current.
