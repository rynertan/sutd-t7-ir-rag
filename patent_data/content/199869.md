## Abstract
A device for rotating a screw into or out of a workpiece, the device being connectible to a power drill and including a screw driving member. There is provided between the power drill and the screw driving member a mechanism for determining the direction of rotation of the screw driving member and a torque adjusting mechanism for controlling the depth a screw is to be driven into a workpiece and including clutch means rotatably associated with the rota tional direction determining mechanism. The rotational direction determining mechanism comprises a planetary gear system, whereof the planet carrier is adapted to be locked to effect rotation of the screw driving member in a screw extraction sense i.e. reverse rotation or to be re leased to effect rotation of the screw driving member in a screw insertion sense i.e. forwards rotation .
