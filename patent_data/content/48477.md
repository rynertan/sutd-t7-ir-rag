# Subscriber line interface circuit utilizing impedance synthesizer and shared voltage source for loop current regulation control.

## Abstract
A subscriber line interface circuit is described wherein current supplied to a telephone subscriber line from a shared voltage source such as a DC DC converter is regulated thereby permitting a regulated line current to be supplied to a plurality of line circuits from a single shared voltage source. In accordance with the present invention, both the dc line feed and the ac transmission requirements of a subscri ber line interface circuit for a telephone exchange are implemented in a single circuit incorporating ac and dc impedance synthesis techniques. A significant reduction in the heretofore required expensive and bulky discrete compo nents of the subscriber line interface circuit is achieved.
