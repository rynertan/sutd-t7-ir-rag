# Device for sequentially distributing electrical power to a plurality of load elements on a rotating member.

## Abstract
A helicopter deicing control system 10 is provided for selectively distributing D.C. electrical power to a plurality of deicing segments 80, 90 on main and tail rotor blades with only two slip ring assemblies 60 and 61, 62 and 63 for each rotor drive shaft. A power distribution controller 20 receives electrical power from the helicopter s onboard, fixed electrical power system and provides an output signal including power and control D.C. electrical signals of opposite polarities. A distributor 70 receives the output signal from controller 20 and increments a rotary switch 74 upon receipt of a D.C. electrical control signal, and distributes power to the main rotor deicing segment 90 connected to the rotary switch 74 contact then engaged upon the receipt of a D.C. electrical power signal so as to sequentially deliver D.C. electrical power to the desired main rotor deicing segment. Controller 20 includes provisions for individually pre selecting the operating time for each deicing segment 80, 90 , testing the operation and providing a continuous visual indi cation of the operational status of deicing control system 10 .
