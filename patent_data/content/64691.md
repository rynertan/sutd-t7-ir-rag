## Description
TEST DEVICE HANDLING SYSTEM Field of the Invention The present invention relates to apparatus and process for handling flexible objects, especially test devices used in the determination of a particular constituent in a sample. More particularly, it is concerned with vacuum apparatus and a process capable of removing one test device at a time from a cartridge or magazine containing multiple test devices. Background of the Invention Increasingly, test devices in the form of reagent strips are being used to provide convenient and rapid analysis of various types of samples, including samples of biological, industrial and automotive fluids, wines, and the like. Diagnostic test devices designed for detecting various clinically significant substances or constituents in biological fluids, such as urine and blood, including lysed or unlysed blood, blood plasma and blood serum, have in many cases supplanted prior wet chemistry techniques which were both cumbersome and time consuming. These diagnostic test devices have thus assisted in the fast and accurate diagnosis and treatment of disease. Conventional test devices generally comprise an.absorbent or porous matrix incorporated with indicator reactants, usually of a colorimetric nature. The sample to be tested is contacted with the matrix, such as by momentary immersion where the sample is liquid, and the indicator response is observed after a period of time. For example, in the detection of occult blood in urine a diagnostic test device can be employed which comprises an absorbent paper impregnated with o tolidine and peroxide. When this test device is wetted with urine containing occult blood, decomposition of the peroxide occurs with the accompanying oxidation of the o tolidine to provide a color response.This test is sensitive and extremely useful in diagnosing urinary tract disorders. For ease in handling, the absorbent or porous matrix, sometimes called a carrier matrix , is advantageously affixed to an insoluble support member such as an organo plastic strip, e.g., polystyrene, by suitable means such as double faced adhesive tape.Optically transparent substrate material known asTRICYTE, polystyrene film made by Dow Chemical Company, is preferred. The support member normally has a thickness of about .190mm, a width of about 5mm and a length which can vary depending on the intended use, the number of reagent areas present, et cetera. Currently, test devices are being made by the Ames Division of MilesLaboratories, Inc. which have lengths of about 85.5mm and about 82.5mm. Obviously, based on these dimensions and the materials involved, such test devices tend to be small, elongated and flexible in nature. While these test devices are easily manageable during manual handling operations, automated handling is another matter. With the need for automated equipment employing test devices for determining constituents in fluids, especially for performing multiple diagnostic tests, it is essential that a mechanical system be devised which is capable of rapidly, accurately and reliably handling one test device at a time. The removal of a single test device from a cartridge or magazine containing multiple test devices to permit the transfer of the single test device to another portion of a system for contact with a sample to be tested is, therefore, a key to automating such testing. In one very special case, i.e., very small test devices which contain a single reagent area, apparatus has been developed for ejecting one test device at a time from a magazine or cartridge containing multiple test devices of a similar nature. Generally, the substrate for such test devices is only slightly larger than the dimensions of the absorbent matrix, which normally measures about 5mm by about 10mm. Typically, the magazine or cartridge is spring loaded and the configuration is such that only one test device at a time can be ejected when pressure is applied to one edge of the bottommost test device. For standard test devices having elongated dimensions as set forth above, however, there is no apparatus available for removing one test device at a time from a cartridge or magazine containing other test devices.The system employed in the special case of very small test devices is not effective for use with standard test devices. Accordingly, for both medical and industrial applications which require automation there is a need for fool proof test device handling apparatus capable of removing a single test device from a cartridge or magazine in order that that single reagent test device can be transferred to another portion of the automated system. Summary of the Invention An object of the present invention is to provide means for removing a single test device at a time from a cartridge or magazine containing multiple test devices. Another object of the present invention is to provide for automated test device handling which is capable of rapidly, accurately and reliably removing a single test device from a cartridge or magazine containing multiple test devices. In accordance with the present invention, test device handling apparatus and a process are disclosed which involves a cartridge or magazine capable of retaining multiple test devices resting on each other, the test devices being retained inside the magazine by detents located on both sides of an opening in the bottom of the cartridge or magazine, and vacuum means for causing the bottommost test device in the cartridge or magazine to flex sufficiently to pass over the detents and be removable from the cartridge or magazine while other test devices remain in the cartridge or magazine. Description of the Drawings Other and further objects, advantages and features of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description thereof, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in.which Fig. 1 shows an embodiment of the invention, with portions thereof being shown in cross section Fig. 2 is a top view of the apparatus in Fig. 1, taken along lines 2 2 Fig. 3 is an enlarged cross sectional drawing of the portion of Fig. 1 illustrated by dotted line anQ Figs. 4, 5 and 6 are alternative embodiments of cartridges or magazines for holding test devices which can be utilized in the present invention, said cartridges or magazines being shown in cross section. Description of Preferred Embodiments In Figs. 1 and 2 a cartridge or magazine 10 for test devices, such as reagent strips, is shown. Magazine 10, as illustrated, is open at the top and has rigid si3 walls 11 and 12 which together with rigid end walls 13 and 14 form an elongated rectangular shaped container having interior dimensions slightly larger than test devices 16 contained therein. The bottom of magazine 10 has an opening 18, the width of which is equal to the width of the interior dimensions of magazine 10 formed by the interior of side walls 11 and 12 and the length of which is slightly smaller than the interior dimensions of side walls 13 and 14.End member 20 and 21, which extend at right angles to side walls 13 and 14 of magazine 10, form detents or ledges at either end of opening 18 for retaining test devices 16 inside magazine 10. Thus, the bottommost test devices 16 inside magazine 10 is retained in magazine 10 solely by the detents or ledges formed by end members 20 and 21 and other test devices 16 are supported by the bottommost test device, resting one upon the other in parallel layered fashion. The positioning of the test devices 16 inside magazine 10 is best illustrated in Fig. 3 which shows a lower corner of magazine 10 in enlarged cross section. This Figure illustrates how the test devices 16 rest one upon the other in parallel fashion inside magazine 10 with the bottommost test device 16 being held inside container 10 by the detents or ledges formed by the end members. The bottommost test device 16 is thus not supported at any other point except at its extreme ends by end members 20 and 21. Other test devices 16 inside magazine 10 rest one upon the other, as illustrated inFigs. 1 and 3, and are so positioned inside magazine 10 that reagent matrix areas 23 and 24, which are attached to a suitable substrate 26, face upward in a direction opposite opening 18. Beneath magazine 10 and aligned with opening 18 is vacuum transport means or pickup head 28 having a housing 30 with an open chamber 32 at its top which is connected by means of conduit 34 to a vacuum source not shown .Vacuum transport means 28 is capable of moving in at least two directions, up and down, and the dimensions of this member are such that upper surface 35 of vacuum transport menas 28 can enter opening 18 of magazine 10 and contact the lower surface of substrate 26 of the bottommost test device 16 inside magazine 10. In operation, magazine 10 normally is retained in a vertical position and loaded with multiple test devices 16 positioned inside magazine 10 in the manner illustrated by Figs. 1, 2 and 3. Test devices 16 are then removed one at a time from magazine 10, as required, by moving vacuum transport means 28 upward through opening 18 such that the top surface 35 of vacuum transport means 28 rests against substrate 26 of the bottommost test devices 16 inside magazine 10. By then applying a vacuum through conduit 34 the bottommost test device 16 can be held by the pressure exerted against chamber 32 of vacuum transport means 28 and said test device will move downward as vacuum transport means 28 moves downward.By pulling downwardly at the center of the bottommost test device 16 vacuum transport means 28 causes the flexible substrate 26 of said test device to flex and slightly distort into a U shaped configuration in which the center of the bottommost test device 16 is lower than the ends of said test device held by the detents formed by end members 20 and 21. As vacuum transport means 28 continues to move downwardly the distortion of the bottommost test device 16 continues until the ends of said test device become released from the detents formed by end members 20 and 21 and test device 16 is thereby removed from magazine 10. Due to the fact that only the bottommost test device is distorted or flexed at any given time the other test devices remain inside magazine 10 as the bottommost test device 16 is withdrawn through opening 18.Once removed from magazine 10 a test device 16 can be transferred by vacuum transport means 28 or any other suitable means to a different location. Following such transfer the same or a different vacuum transport means 28 can be used to remove another test device 16 from magazine 10. It should be understood that the materials used for construction of magazine 10 and vacuum transport means 28 are not critical and may be of any suitable rigid or semi rigid material, such as metal, plastic, etc.Although the side walls of magazine 10 are normally continuous, retainers in the form of rod members may be used in place of continuous walls. As indicated above, the interior dimensions of magazine 10 must be such that multiple test devices 16 can be inserted into the magazine with sufficient tolerance to prevent binding between the test devices and the side walls. The detents or ledges retaining the bottommost test device 16 in magazine 10 need be only the minimum width necessary to provide support such that the weight of the test devices inside magazine 10 will not cause the bottommost or lowest test device 16 to pass through opening 18 until that test device is removed by vacuum transport means 28.Obviously, chamber 32 of vacuum transport means 28 may take many different configurations, such as a rectangular configuration, an eliptical configuration, a circular configuration, etc. In fact, chamber 32 need not be a single chamber, but may consist of multiple chambers.The top surface 35 of vacuum transport means 28 is preferably flat, but may be slightly curved so as to better adapt to the flexed configuration of the bottommost test device 16 as that test device is removed from magazine 10 through opening 18. While the ledges or detents formed by end members 20 and 21 illustrated in Fig. 1 are preferred for retaining the bottommost test device 16 inside magazine 10, other detents for supporting test devices 16 may be used, including the alternatives illustrated in Figs. 4 through 6. In Fig. 4, for example, rod members 37 and 38 are employed to provide suitable support for the bottommost test device not shown placed in magazine 10. Rod members 37 and 38 are located at the bottom of end walls 13 and 14, respectively. In Fig. 5, tapered end members 39 and 40 are illustrated, whereas in Fig. 6 curved end members 42 and 43 are illustrated. These embodiments, together with other alternative embodiments, are within the scope of the present invention.The detents of the magazine 10 may also be pressure actuated in a manner not shown , such that pressure applied to the detents will cause the detents to move slightly thereby facilitating the release of a single flexible member at a time from magazine 10. While normally magazine 10 will be positioned in a vertical or upright position, such that the flexible members contained therein rest one upon the other by means of gravity, the concept of the present invention is applicable to pressure feed systems which by means of spring loading or other suitable pressure are capable of holding multiple flexible members in place against the detents or end members of the cartridge or magazine 10. Thus, if desired, test devices 16 could be held by suitable means, such as a spring member not shown , against end members 20 and 21. For such loading magazine 10 would not need to be positioned in an upright position. From the foregoing, it will be seen that this invention is well adapted to attain all of the ends and objects herein above set forth, together with other advantages which are obvious and which are inherent to the system. The present invention permits a single flexible object, such as a test device, to be removed from a container holding multiple flexible objects. While the invention has been described with particularity to test devices such as reagent strips, it will be understood that the system and handling apparatus maybe used for the handling of other elongated flexible members such as thin metallic or plastic members. The pick up head and magazine of the present invention permit systems to be automated by assuring the retrieval and delivery of one flexible member at a time. Obviously, many other modifications and variations of the invention as hereinbefore set forth may be made without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.
