## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN MICROWAVE COOKERS This invention relates to microwave cookers. It is known to provide a double oven cooker in the same built in framework in which one of the ovens is a microwave oven and the other a conventional oven. It is further known to provide heating elements in a microwave oven in order to provide a so called browning facility when using microwave energy. The browning facility produces more thorough cook of the outer regions of the food. Also the heating elements, which are utilised with the microwave energy to provide the browning facility, can be used alone for conventional cooking, i.e. primarily by convection, within the oven. The known arrangements referred to lack a certain operational flexibility and it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved microwave cooker which offers wider utilisation possibilities than has been the case hitherto. According to the invention there is provided a microwave cooker comprising two adjacent ovens, a mode stirrer disposed in each oven, a source of microwave energy and a wave guide accomodating said source and having respective branches which connect with the ovens so as to guide microwave energy towards the corresponding mode stirrer, characterised in that the wave guide includes deflector means for directing microwave energy exclusively along one or other of the branches and that one of the ovens includes a heating element enabling said one oven to be heated by said element and or microwave energy directed thereto. In one form of the invention the ovens are disposed one above the other and the wave guide is located with the branches thereof respectively opening through the rear walls of the ovens. The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings, in which Figure la is a perspective view of a microwave cooker according to the invention as viewed from the rear thereof Figures ib and ic are side elevations of the microwave cooker shown in Figure la and illustrate different modes of operation, Figures 2a, 2b and 2c respectively illustrate perspective, plan sectional and sectional perspective views of the deflector means used in another embodiment of the invention, Figure 2b being drawn to a larger scale than Figures 2a and 2c, andFigure 3 shows the deflector means used in another embodiment of the invention. Referring to Figures 1 of the drawings, a microwave cooker generally indicated by the reference 1 includes two adjacent ovens 3 and 5 disposed one above the other and each formed with closure doors not shown in respective front walls 7 and 9 thereof. Motor driven mode stirrer devices 11 and 13 of known form are mounted in the top walls of the ovens 3 and 5 and each serves, during microwave operation of the associated oven, to rotate the standing wave pattern of microwaves around the oven cavity to prevent cold spots being established in food being cooked. Wave guide conduit means, generally indicated by the reference 15, are provided at the rear of the ovens and include a horizontally disposed supply conduit 17 leading to vertically extending branches 19 and 21 which at their ends remote from the supply conduit 17 open respectively into the ovens 3 and 5.AdJacent the corresponding ovens, the branches 19 and 21 include side wall deflector elements 23 and 25 which when microwave energy passes through the corresponding branch each serve to reflect that energy on to the associated mode stirrer device 11 or 13. Disposed in the supply conduit 17 is a source 27 such as a magnetron of microwave energy which directs a stream of microwaves towards a deflector means, in this example a flap 29. The flap is pivotally mounted at pivot 31 for rotation about a horizontal pivotal axis. The flap is rotated by an appropriate drive means so that it can occupy either of the positions shown in Figures Ib and ic and illustrated by the broken lines in Figure la. In the position shown in Figure ib and flap 29 totally seals the branch 19 from the flow therethrough of microwave energy whilst in the position shown inFigure 1c the deflector totally seals the branch 21 from the flow of microwave energy therethrough.As will be observed, the alternative positions of the flap 29 are disposed at to the axis of the supply conduit 17 whilst the deflector elements 23 and 25 are respectively disposed at 45 to the axes of the branches 19 and 21. Thus, in the position shown inFigure 1b microwave energy emitted in a horizontal beam from the source 27 is deflected by the flap 29 and deflector element 25 to provide a horizontal beam of microwave energy directed towards the mode stirrer 13. Likewise, in the condition of operation depicted in Figure Ic , the flap 29 and deflector element 23 deliver the beam from the source 27 as a horizontal beam directed towards stirrer 11. The oven 5 is provided with heating elements not shown to allow that the oven to be used either without microwave energy as a conventional oven or with microwave energy to provide microwave cooking with a browning facility. Suitable interlock circuitry is provided to ensure, on the one hand, that microwave energy from the source is not transmitted unless the flap 29 is in one or other of the positions illustrated in the drawings of Figure 1 and on the other hand to ensure that microwave energy is not transmitted when the flap 29 is in one of its alternative positions unless the door of the oven to which the microwave energy would be deflected is closed. In another embodiment of the present invention, the two branches 19 and 21, and the supply conduit 17 are linked by a common housing having a generally rectangular construction shown at 30 in the perspective and plan sectional views of Figure 2a and 2b respectively. The housing has a cylindrical boe 31 which accomodates ss cylindrical deflector block 34, moulted for rotation about a vertical axis X of the housing. Drive means not shown in the drawings are also provided for effecting rotation of the block 34. The branches are connected to the housing at opposite side faces 35, 36 thereof and communicate with the bore 31 via coaxially extending ducts 35 and 36 .The supply conduit 17, on the other hand, is connected to a remaining side face 37 of the block and communicates with the bore via a further duct 37 , orthogonally inclined to ducts 35 and 36 . In this example, the ducts 35 , 36 and 37 lie in a common plane and the block 34 has a generally arcuate passageway 38 for selectively connecting the supply conduit exclusively to one or other of the branches. In one orientation of the block shown in Figure 2b, for example microwave energy is directed from the supply conduit along the branch 19. By rotating the block 34 through an angle of 900, however, the supply conduit may be coupled exclusively to the other branch 21. The arrangement of the housing and the deflector block is also illustrated in the perspective sectional view of Figure 2c. In a yet further embodiment of the invention, illustrated in the plan sectional view of Figure 3, each branch 19, 21 is provided with a slidable shutter 19a and 21a which is guided within respective slots 19b and 21b. Each shutter may be seiect ve1, located so as to close of the associated branch so that energy is directed exclusively to the other branch. The double oven microwave cooker construction described provides great flexibility as regards cooking possibilities.Thus, for example, it is possible to employ one or both ovens solely for microwave cooking. Similiarly, oven 5 can be employed purely for conventional cooking by utilising the heating elements which are provided therein. Furthermore the heating element provided in oven 5 can be used to brown food items cooked therein by microwave, or alternatively oven 5 can be used solely for conventional cooking whilst oven 3 is being used for microwave cooking.
