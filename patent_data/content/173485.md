# Polymerization catalyst, production and use.

## Abstract
Ethylene and alpha olefins are homopolymerized or co polymerized with another olefin monomer in the presence of a catalyst system comprising an organo metal cocatalyst and a titanium containing catalyst component, said titanium con taining catalyst component being obtained by reacting to gether a porous particulate material, an organic magnesium compound, an oxygen containing compound, a halogen, in terhalogen compound or halosilane and titanium tetrachloride.
