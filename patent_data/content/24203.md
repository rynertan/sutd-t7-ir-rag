# Method of making a three dimensional laminate.

## Abstract
A heat sensitive, three dimensional thermoplastic layer is laminated to a thermoplastic substrate by a specific fusion bonding process which produces a laminate having substan tially no thermal distortion. This process employs cooling to protect the three dimensional structure from thermal damage and balancing of the heat flow from the substrate to prevent warpage. In the preferred process a grass like sheet of low density polyethylene is fusion bonded to a rigid high density polyethylene substrate.
