# Priority scheduling apparatus.

## Abstract
Priority scheduling apparatus which allows for aging of the scheduled elements, so that an element of low priority will be assured of eventually receiving service. The elements are enqueued into, and dequeued from, a table divided into ranks. Each element is enqueued at a rank given by I B N P, where B is the rank from which the last dequeue occurred, N is the number of ranks of the table con taining at least one element, and P is the priority level assigned to the element being enqueued. When elements are dequeued from the table they are always dequeued from the highest oc cupied rank. The apparatus includes a control block storing the start ing address of the table, and the values of B and N. The control block also stores a bit map having one bit for each rank in the table which is set to one when that rank is occupied by one or more elements and reset to zero when the rank is empty. The bit map is scanned to determine the highest occupied rank, and so determine the level from which a dequeue must take place. This value is stored to furnish the value of B for subse quent enqueuing operations.
