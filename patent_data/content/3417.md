# Double glazed panel structure and a method and apparatus for filling the same.

## Abstract
The invention relates to apparatus for filling a double glazed panel structure with granular material for the purposes of insulation, shading or privacy. Known forms of apparatus are only suitable for small structures, and are impractical for large structures or large numbers of structures. The apparatus of the invention is suitable for each large structure, and includes a header 16 secured above the panel structure 18 . A container 4 stores the granular material 30 , and ducts 12, 14, 20 lead from the container to an inlet and an outlet of the header. A low pressure blower 6 blows gas round the circuit constituted by the container, the header and the ducts. The header is provided with outlet apertures which leads to the interspace of the panel structure. The blown gas conveys the granular material from the container to the header in a fluidised state. In the header, at least some of the granular material drops through the outlet apertures into the interspace. The panel structure may be evacuated by allowing the granular material to drain into a flow of conveying gas circulating in an evacuation duct 24 running along the base of the panel structure. The invention also relates to a method of filling a panel structure, and to the combination of filling and evacuating apparatus and panel structure.
