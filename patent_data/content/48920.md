# Easy opening container.

## Abstract
A closure for a container comprising a panel 16 extending over the open end of the container and made of thin sheet metal such that it expands into convex shape when pressurized. Contents are place into the container, the panel having a score therein defining a tear out portion which includes the crest of the convexity and the tear panel being ruptured along the score line by a lever tap 25 which is secured to the panel outside the tear out portion on the slope of the convexity so that the handle portion of the tab is held firmly against the peripheral edge of the panel where it is buttressed against the top edge of the container so as to prevent accidental impacts against the handle to cause it to open the container, the handle portion of the bat being spring loaded against a radial portion of the container below the closure at one side thereof.
