# Ram extruders.

## Abstract
The disclosure relates to a ram extruder 10 including an extruder barrel 11 having an extrusion die 14 at one end and a hydraulic ram 20 at the other end having a piston 22 which is advanced along the barrel by the ram to displace material in the barrel through the extrusion die. To facilitate loading of the barrel a loading port 24 is provided in the side of the barrel ad jacent said other end of the barrel through which the barrel may be charged after retraction of the piston following an extrusion operation and a port closure device 25, 26, 27, 28 is provided to close the port after extrusion and evacuate air from the barrel prior to advancing the piston 22 past the port to minimise the air contained in the barrel prior to the extrusion operation.
