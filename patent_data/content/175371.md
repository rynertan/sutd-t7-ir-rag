# Method for silver staining proteins and nucleic acids.

## Abstract
A method is disclosed for the optical detection of proteins and nucleic acids in a matrix, such as plyacrylamide elec trophoresis gels. The method comprises fixing the proteins and nucleic acids in the matrix using aromatic sulfonic acids having tertiary amines capable of forming condination complexes with silver ion.
