# EGG ALBUMEN PRODUCT HAVING DECREASED THERMOGELATION TEMPERATURE AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION THEREOF

## Abstract
The thermogelation temperature of egg albumen can be decreased by cooling an alkaline solution of egg albumen heated to a temperature within the range of from 60 C. and the gelation temperature of the egg albumen, the solution having a pH within the range of from 8 and 10 and an egg albumen content in said solution of less than 20 , to a temp erature sufficient to arrest further modification of the protein. The product is a thermogelable egg albumen having a low ered thermogelation temperature.
