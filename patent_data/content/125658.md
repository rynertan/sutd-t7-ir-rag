# Corrosion resistant surface treated steel strip and process for making.

## Abstract
A steel strip having an Fe P alloy with a phosphorus content of 0.0003 to 15 by weight electrodeposited as an uppermost layer on at least one surface of the strip is pro vided as well as a process for making. The Fe P alloy may be electrodeposited onto a cold rolled steel strip either directly or via an underlying layer of zinc or zinc alloy previously electrodeposited onto the strip. The uppermost Fe P plating layer on the strip may be chemically treated with a phos phate to form a phosphate film which provides improved corrosion resistance without paint coating thereon.
