## Description
THERAPEUTIC GRANULES TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention is related to therapeutic granules which have an enteric coating. The use of therapeutic agents such as aspirin is widespread as a means for alleviating pain of various types. One problem associated with aspirin for many people is irritation of the stomach. As a result prior art developments have provided enteric coatings which allow the aspirin particles to pass through the stomach and into the intestines. The more alkaline environment of the intestines dissolves disrupts the enteric coating allowing the aspirin to be released. Insuring satisfactory coatings and release of the active has been a problem continually faced by workers in the field. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION As noted above enteric coatings for analgesics have been disclosed in the prior art. Specific disclosures concerning enteric coatings are contained in many different patents. U.S. Patent 3,524,910, August 18, 1970 to Holliday et al discloses analgesic compositions wherein the analgesic e.g. aspirin is coated with ethyl cellulose in a weight amount relative to the amount of analgesic of from 1 22 to 1 50. U.S. Patent 3,656,997, April 18, 1972 toCordes discloses analgesic containing gelatin capsules having a first coating of an enteric material. U.S. Patent 3,691,090,September 12, 1972 to Kitajima et al discloses a method of encapsulating aspirin cores with an enteric polymer. U.S. Patent 3,906,086, September 16, 1975 to Guy et al discloses particles having an aspirin core and an enteric phthalate coating. U.S.Patent 4,308,251, December 29, 1981, to Dunn et al discloses aspirin tablets containing aspirin, an enteric material and an erosion promoting agent such as corn starch. Additional references disclosing coatings on analgesics include U.S. Patent 2,953,497, September 20, 1960 to Press which discloses analgesic granules having a celllose acetate phthalate coating. U.S. Patent 3,166,476, January 19, 1965 toLowey discloses aspirin particles which have a first coating of a material such as gelatin and a second enteric coating. BritishPatent 1,129,811, October 9, 1968 to Aspro Nicholas Ltd. discloses aspirin particles which have a coating of a polysalicylide and possibly a second, unspecified, coating. While the prior art discloses a variety of enteric coated therapeutic approaches, areas for improvement still exist. It has now been discovered that using a polyvinylpyrrolidone polymer allows for more efficient coating of therapeutic cores with a therapeutic agent. Surprisingly the rate of dissolution of such granules which also have an enteric coating is improved. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide therapeutic granules which have a coating of the therapeutic cores with a therapeutic agent which can be applied more efficiently. It is a further object of the present invention to provide therapeutic granules which have in addition to therapeutic coating an enteric coating. It is still a further object of the present invention to provide therapeutic granules which have an improved dissolution rate. It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a method for treating pain, fever, and inflammation. These and other objects will become readily apparent from the detailed description which follows. All percentages and ratios herein are by weight unless otherwise specified. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention pertains to enteric coated therapeutic granules comprising a a non steroidal, therapeutic active core b a first coating adhered to said core of a non steroidal, therapeutic active and a polyvinylpyrrolidone polymer and c a second coating adhered to said first coating of an enteric material wherein said enteric coated granules are from about 0.5mm to about 1.5mm, preferably from about 0.7mm to about 1.2mm, in diameter, the weight ratio of said core to said first coating is from about 1 0.3 to about 1 1, the amount of polyvinylpyrrolidone polymer is from about 1 to about 20 of the entire first coating, and said enteric coating is from about 2 to about 10 by weight of the entire enteric coated granules. The present invention also encompasses a method for alleviating pain, fever, and inflammation. The essential as well as optional components of the invention claimed herein are set forth in the paragraphs which follow. In the present application the following terms have the meanings given. Pharmaceutically acceptable or pharmacological ly acceptable , as used herein, means that the ingredients used in the compositions are suitable for use in contact with the tissue of humans, without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit risk ratio. The term comprising , as used herein, means that various other compatible components, including both active and inert ingredients, can be conjointly employed in the compositions of this invention. The term comprising thus encompasses and includes the more restrictive terms consisting of and consisting essentially of . By compatible herein is meant that the components of the present invention are capable of being commingled without interacting in a manner which would substantially decrease the efficacy of the therapeutic under ordinary use conditions.Non steroidal Therapeutic Active Core The core of the granules described and claimed herein is a non steroidal, therapeutic active. The therapeutic actives used in the present invention preferably have analgesic, antipyretic and anti inflammatory properties. Aspirin is an example of such a material and is the preferred material. However, there are numerous other materials which can be used. These include calcium carbaspirin, chloline salicylate, salicylic acid, naproxen, ibuprofen, fenoprofen, zomepirac and mixtures thereof. The core of the present granules generally contains about 50 to about 100 , preferably from about 85 to about 95 of the therapeutic active. Optional components which may be used in the cores include diluents, binders, disintegrents, glidents, buffering adjuvants and direct acting adjuvants. Numerous pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible materials can be found in various pharmacological references. Two such references are PharmaceuticalDosage Forms Tablets, Vol. 1, Ed. H. A. Lieberman and L.Lachman, Marcel Dekker, Inc., 1980 and Proposed Monograph for OTC Internal Analgesic, Antipyretic and Anti rheumaticDrugs , Federal Register, July 8, 1977. Both are incorporated herein by reference. Exemplary materials of the above types include dicalcium phosphate and lactose as diluents gelatin and polyvinylpyrrolidone as binders starch, sodium starch glycolate, cellulosics and cross linked polyvinylpyrrolidone as disintegrents stearates as lubricants fumed silica as glydents glycine and other amino acids, bicarbonate salts, carbonate salts, magnesium and aluminum hydroxides, aluminum glycinate, citrate salts and borate salts as buffering adjuvants and caffeine, ascorbic acid and other vitamins, antihistamines and other cough, cold, allergy bronchodilator and antiasthamatic drugs as direct acting adjuvents. These optional components individually may be present at a level of about 0 to about 50 , preferably from about 5 to about 15 of the core.Active Coating The active coat which is adhered to the core of the granules can be any of the actives mentioned previously as suitable for core use.
