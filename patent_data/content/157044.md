# Method and composition for the prevention or inhibition of corrosion.

## Abstract
A method and composition for preventing corrosion is disclosed. The method involves forming a coating of from about 2 to 15 mils thick on a surface, with a composition comprising an over based alkaline earth organic sulfonate salt, a drying oil, a copper or rare earth metal drier, a zinc metal drier, a naphthenic or straight chain paraffinic oil, and petrolatum, and curing the coating. Preferably, the com position will include a copper metal drier, a zinc metal drier, and a rare earth metal drier. The method and composition are particularly useful for metal surfaces which contact sea water.
