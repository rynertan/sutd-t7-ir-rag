# High voltage welding.

## Abstract
An electrode 75 disposed within an insulating sleeve 86 is placed adjacent a work piece 9 to provide a selected gap between the electrode and the work piece. The atmos phere between the electrode and the work piece is first ionized and then a welding arc discharges between the electrode and the work piece. The orientation of the elec trode can be adjusted by rotation of the electrode assembly 36 , the amount of the gap by rotation of member 78 , vertical placement of the electrode head 36 by eccentric means 40 and spacing between the terminus of the forward movement of arm 32 and the work piece station by adjusting the position of stop 54 . Spacing of the electrode from the work piece enables the welding of similar and dissimilar metals such as fine wires of gold, silver, brass and others used in such applications as jewelry, medical, and electronic to provide the required strength, but without marring the surface of the work piece.
