# A process for manufacturing sealing gaskets.

## Abstract
A thread of a fluid material for gasket manufacture is deposited onto a non planar, non adhesive support sheet 12 from a nozzle 22 that is displaced above the support along a path coresponding to the outline of the gasket, with subsequent curing of the fluid material. The support sheet is prepared by pressing sheet material into a tridimensional shape whereby its surface contains the non planar outline of the gasket to be manufactured the shaped support is positioned with respect to a nozzle carried by a manipulator 20 capable of being controlled to move the nozzle with respect to the support along three independent spatial coordinates and the nozzle is fed with said fluid material while being displaced along said non planar outline. Prefer ably, the support sheet is kept flattened by vacuum against an underlying, matching surface.
