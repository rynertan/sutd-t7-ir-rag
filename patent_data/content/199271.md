# IMPROVED MAGNETIC RECORDING MEMBER

## Abstract
Disclosed is a method of making an improved magnetic recording member comprising the steps of providing an aluminium base alloy member, anodizing the member to provide thereon an oxide coating having pores therein, and treating the coating to enlarge the pore size, the treating being controlled to maintain the individuality of the pores. A magnetically receptive material is deposited in the enlarged pores to provide a magnetic recording member having an increased dipole signal.
