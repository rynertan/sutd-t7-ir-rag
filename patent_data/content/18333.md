# IMMOBILIZED MICROBIAL ENZYME CELL SYSTEMS, PROCESS FOR THEIR PRODUCTION AND THEIR USE IN PREPARING ALPHA KETO ACIDS FROM THE CORRESPONDING AMINO ACIDS

## Abstract
According to the invention, α keto acids are prepared from the corresponding amino acids by using a biocatalyst of a microbial origin, which has been immobilized in a polymeric matrix. The immobilized biocatalyst is effective and specific for the synthesis of α keto acids from D amino acids. The product can easily be separated from the particu late catalyst. In the synthesis reaction, hydrogen, peroxide is formed, which is decomposed by a catalyst which also is immobilized in the polymeric matrix. The invention can be used in continuous or discontinuous processes for the preparation of α keto acids from the corresponding D,L or D amino acids.
