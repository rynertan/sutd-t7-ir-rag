# Novel thioesters and process for the preparation of the same.

## Abstract
Novel thioesters effective as acylating agents for amines or hydrazines, especially effective as active esters in synth esis of cephalosporin compounds are disclosed. The novel thioester of the present invention can be prepared by reacting a thiol or a derivative thereof with an acetic acid derivative or a reactive derivative thereof. By reacting the thioester of the present invention with a 7 aminocephalosporin derivative or a salt thereof, cephalos porin derivatives or pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof which are excellent antibiotic substances having a high antimicrobial activity can be obtained in high yield very safely.
