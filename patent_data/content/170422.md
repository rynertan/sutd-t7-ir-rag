# Calender or roll assembly.

## Abstract
In order that a calender may successfully produce a substantially uniform thickness web for a wider range of materials and thicknesses than hitherto, the axis of a first roll, e.g. upper roll 10, is adjustable in a plane A which is parallel to yet offset from a plane B in which a second roll, e.g. lower roll 12, is adjustable. Also, the axis of the central roll 11 of the stack is transversely adjustable between the plane A and the plane B. In this way the central roll 11 can deflect sufficiently to compensate for deflection of the outer rolls 10, 12.
