## Abstract
A system and apparatus for helically scanning a mag netic tape 2 having slant tracks 3 wherein the slant tracks 3 are divided into a plurality of segments. A helical scan drum 15 has at least first a second rotary head pairs 11A, 11B 12A, 12B 13A, 13B . The first head pair 11A, 11B scans at least one of the segments of a first track 3 while the second head pair 12A, 12B simultaneously scans at least one of the segments of a second slant track 3 of the magnetic tape 2 . This system is particularly useful for uti lizing a tape 2 for portable audio use wherein the same tape 2 is also useful for video applications.
