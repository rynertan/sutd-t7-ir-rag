## Description
The field of the invention is variable speed drives for a.c. motors, and particularly, alternating current sources which provide polyphase, variable frequency, and variable amplitude currents to motor stator windings. Prior alternating current sources employ solid state switches to produce pulse waveforms that approximate sinusoidal waveforms suitable for application to the motor s stator windings. These are generally divided into two classes those which employ current source inverters and those which employ voltage source inverters. A current source inverter receives a controlled d.c. link current and switches it between the motor stator windings in such a manner as to approximate the application of polyphase sinusoidal currents of the proper frequency and amplitude. Such an inverter is disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,400,655. A voltage source inverter on the other hand, receives a d.c. voltage and chops it into a series of voltage pulses which are applied to the motor stator windings. The widths of the pulses are modulated such that the resulting currents produced in the motor stator windings have a sinusoidal shape of the desired frequency and amplitude. Such an inverter is shown, for example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,469,997. Both the current source and the voltage source inverters have their respective advantages and disadvantages which are well known in the art. As a result, both technologies are employed in commercially available motor drive products, with the choice being determined primarily by performance and price consideration. The present invention solves a problem which is inherent in prior voltage source inverters that employ current regulators. It has long been recognized that at high motor speeds such voltage source inverters do not accurately control sinusoidal motor currents. This has been attributed by some to a loss in gain in voltage source inverters at high speeds, while others relate the problem to the back e.m.f. of the motor. Numerous schemes for solving this problem have been proposed, some of which involve compensation circuitry that is either very complex or that requires detailed knowledge about the particular motor being driven. The inability of such voltage source inverters to accurately produce current waveforms of commanded amplitude and phase is particularly troublesome when such inverters are used in a motor drive that relies on controlling the magnetic flux vector. Such vector control strategies require that the amplitude and phase of the sinusoidal current waveform applied to each stator winding be precisely conrolled at all times. Only then will the total magnetic flux have the proper magnitude and direction to produce the desired motor torque and speed. The present invention relates to a current regulator for variable frequency a.c. power supplies which employ voltage source inverters, and is intended to improve the current regulating capability of such inverters, particularly, at high frequencies. According to the present invention the current regulator includes means for producing an error signal by subtracting an a.c. current feedback signal from an a.c. current command signal and means for producing a composite control signal for a voltage source inverter by adding a signal component proportional to the error signal to a signal component proportional to the integral of the error signal and to a cross coupled component which increases in amplitude as a function of frequency. The cross coupled component is produced by a multiplier which connects to receive a signal component from another phase of the current regulator and to receive a signal proportional to the frequency of the a.c. current command signal. The current regulator of the present invention eliminates errors which are introduced into the current regulator by the conventional proportional plus integral PI compensation circuit that is uniformly employed. It has been discovered that such conventional PI compensation circuits are not accurate when regulating a.c. currents. This inaccuracy increases as a function of the a.c. frequency of the currents being regulated, and this accounts for the difficulties which are encountered when current regulated voltage source inverters are employed to drive electric motors. Unlike prior curcuits, the present invention provides accurate current regulation under steady state conditions at any operating frequency and, hence, accurately regulates the a.c. current produced by a voltage source inverter. An advantage offered by the invention is to provide current regulation for a voltage source inverter which is economical to build and operate. The improved current regulator includes only a few passive components and integrated circuits in addition to those normally employed in a conventional PI current regulator. Furthermore, the present invention is adapted to improve the operation of polyphase motor drive systems which employ vector control strategies to control motor speed, torque or magnetic flux. The present invention may be employed to control the magnitude of n separate a.c. phase currents in response to two orthogonal a.c. current command signals. The magnitude and phase of the resulting motor currents accurately reflect the commanded currents at all operating frequencies. One way of carrying out the invention is described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings which illustrate a preferred embodiment of the invention. In the drawings Referring particularly to FIG. 1, a load 1 is supplied with two phase a.c. power by a voltage source inverter 2. The load 1 may be any one of a number of devices such as a synchronous motor, incuction motor, electrostatic precipitator, induction heating unit or corona treater. The voltage source inverter 2 is a well known circuit which produces pulse width modulated voltage pulses on the lines 3 and 4 in response to control signals on lines 5 and 6. As shown in FIG. 5, these voltage pulses have a constant amplitude V , but their widths are modulated such that the currents, i The output currents i Referring particularly to FIG. 2, a current regulated voltage source inverter system may also be employed to drive a three phase load 20. A voltage source inverter 21 similar to that used in the two phase system may be employed, however, it is driven by three sinusoidal control signals on lines 22 24 and it produces three output currents i The same regulator 7 may be employed in this three phase system, but phase conversions must be made. More specifically, the two phase current regulator control signals which are output on lines 5 and 6 must be converted to the equivalent three phase signals on lines 22 24. This conversion is performed by a 2 phase to 3 phase converter circuit 25 of well known construction. For example, a circuit such as that described in Control and Simulation of a Current Fed Linear Inductor Machine by B. K. Bose and Thomas Lipo published in It should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the current regulator of the present invention may be employed in a wide variety of applications to control a.c. loads having any number of phases. Also, the current command signals i and i, as well as the speed signal Ï‰, may be produced by any one of a number of well known control circuits. The specific construction of the control circuit will depend on the nature of the load and on the particular control strategy which is being implemented. A number of different control circuits for a.c. motors are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,506,321 and 4,266,176. The current regulator of the present invention provides a combination of proportional control action, integral control action, and cross coupled speed compensation action. The q phase and the d phase are handled in the same manner, and the corresponding functional blocks and circuit elements in each phase of the current regulator have been given the same reference number. Referring particularly to FIG. 3, the sinusoidal current feedback signal i This composite control signal also includes a cross coupled component which increases in magnitude at higher frequencies Ï‰ . It is produced by a multiplier block 55 Under steady state conditions the error signals e Referring particularly to FIG. 3 and 4, the preferred embodiment of the invention is constructed using passive components and standard commercially available integrated circuits. The summing point 50 The integral block 53 The inverting input to the operational amplifier 102 The multiplier 55 An oscillator is formed by these cross connections. More specifically, a loop is formed by the multiplier 55 While the preferred embodiment of the invention employs two phases q and d which are in quadrature with each other, current regulators having other numbers of phases may also be constructed. It is only necessary that the cross coupled signals have the proper phase and amlitude relationship. Referring to FIG. 3, for example, the q phase composite control signal on the line 5 lags the d phase composite control signal on line 6 by ninety degrees.
