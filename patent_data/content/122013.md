## Description
POLYMERIC ADDITIVES FOR WATER This invention relates to polymeric additives for water. Most industrial waters contain alkaline earth metal cations, such as those of calcium, barium and magnesium, and several anions such as bicarbonate, carbonate, sulfate, oxalate, phosphate, silicate and fluoride.When combinations of these anions and cations are present in concentrations that exceed the solubility of their reaction products, precipitates form until these concentrations are no longer exceeded. For example, when the concentrations of calcium ion and carbonate ion exceed the solubility of calcium carbonate, a solid phase of calcium carbonate will form. Such concentrations are exceeded for various reasons, such as partial evaporation of the aqueous phase, changes in pH, pressure and or temperature, and the introduction of additional ions that form insoluble compounds with the ions already present in the solution. As these reaction products are precipitated on the surfaces of the watercarrying system, they form scale or deposits, accumulation of which prevents effective heat transfer, interferes with fluid flow, facilitates corrosive processes, and harbors bacteria. Scale is an expensive problem in many industrial water systems and causes delays and shutdowns for cleaning and removal. Scale forming compounds can be prevented from precipitating by inactivating their cations with chelating or sequestering agents, so that the solubility of their reaction products is not exceeded. Generally, this requires as much chelating or sequestering agent as cation, since chelation is a stoichiometric reaction, and these amounts are not always desirable or economical. Almost fifty years ago, it was discovered that certain inorganic polyphosphates would prevent such precipitation when added in amounts far less than the concentrations needed for sequestering or chelating. By polyphosphates is meant phosphates having a molar ratio of metal oxide to P205 in the range 1 1 to 2 1. When a precipitation inhibitor is present in a potentially scaleforming system at a markedly lower concentration than that required for sequestering stoichiometric the scale forming cation, it is said to be present in threshold amounts. See for example, Hatch and Rice, Industrial Engineering Chemistry , Vol. 31, pages 51 to 53 3an. 1939 Reitemeier and Buehrer, 1,3ournal of Physical Chemistry , Vol. 44, No. 5, pages 535 to 536 May 1940 and U.S. Patents Nos. US A 2,358,222 and USA 2,539,305. Generally, sequestering takes place when the weight of the threshold active compound is greater than that of the scale forming cation components. Threshold inhibition generally takes place at a weight ratio of threshold active compound to scale forming cation components of less than 0.5 1.0. Certain water soluble polymers, including groups derived from acrylamide and acrylic acid,have been used to condition wate containing scale forming compounds, for example, see U.S. Patents US A 2,783,200 3,514,476 2,980,610 3,285,886 3,463,730 and 3,518,204. U.S. Patent US A 3,928,196 discloses the use of a copolymer of 2acrylamido 2 methylpropylsulfonic acid and acrylic acid in inhibiting scale. The present invention is based on the discovery that an admixture of a water soluble polymer comprising a carboxylic acid and a sulfonic acid, or their salts, including the copolymer of U S. Patent 3,928,196, in combination with a water soluble polycarboxylate, phosphonate, phosphate, polyphosphate, metal salt and or sulfonate, has a greater effect than would be expected from the sum of their separate effects, i.e. is synergistic. The present invention provides an admixture comprising a a water soluble polymer, preferably having a weight average molecular weight of less than 25,000, as determined by low angle laser light scattering and comprising at least one unsaturated monocarboxylic acid and at least one unsaturated sulfonic acid or salt of such an acid, the sulfonic acid s being 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropyl sulfonic acid, 2 methacrylamido 2 methylpropyl sulfonic acid, styrene sulfonic acid, vinyl sulfonic acid, sulfoalkyl acrylate, sulfoalkyl methacrylate, allyl sulfonic acid, methallyl sulfonic acid, 3 methacrylamido 2 hydroxy propyl sulfonic acid, and or sulfonic acid acrylate, and the weight ratio of carboxylic to sulfonic acid being in the range 1 20 to 20 1, and b at least one water soluble polycarboxylate, phosphonate, organic phosphate, organic polyphosphate, metal salt and or sulfonate. Also in accordance with the present invention, a method of inhibiting the corrosion of metal in an aqueous system comprises adding to the system at least 0.1 mg l of such an admixture. Also in accordance with the invention, a method of inhibiting the precipitation of scale forming salts in an aqueous system comprises adding to the system at least 0.1 mgll of such an admixture in which the unsaturated monocarboxylic acid is one or more of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, c halo acrylic acid, maleic acid or anhydride, itaconic acid or anhydride, vinyl acetic acid, ally1 acetic acid, fumaric acid and or carboxyethyl acrylate, and or a salt of any such acid. The invention also provides a method of inhibiting the formation of insoluble alluvial, metal oxide and metal hydroxide deposits in an aqueous system, comprising adding to the system at least 0.1 mg l of a water soluble polymer having a weight average molecular weight of less than 25,0Q0, as determined by low angle laser light scattering, comprising at least one unsaturated carboxylic acid or salt and at least one unsaturated sulfonic acid or salt in a weight ratio of 1 20 to 20 1, together with a phosphonate. The phrase 11inhibiting the precipitation includes threshold inhibition, dispersion, solubilization, and particle size reduction. The phrase scale forming salts includes any of the scale forming salts, including, but not limited to, calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, calcium phosphate, calcium phosphonate including calcium hydroxyethylidene diphosphonic acid , calcium oxalate, calcium fluoride, barium sulfate and magnesium salts. The phrase aqueous system includes any system containing water including, but not limited to, water in cooling systems, boilers, desalination plants, gas scrubbers, blast furnaces, sewage sludge thermal conditioning equipment, reverse osmosis apparatus, sugar evaporators, paper processing, and mining circuits. The carboxylic acid sulfonic acid polymer was also found to be effective in inhibiting insoluble alluvial deposition, metal oxide and metal hydroxide deposition, especially in combination with a phosphonate. Alluvial deposits include silts clays and particulate material extracted from the air, such as dust. Deposits of any metal oxide or metal hydroxide, e.g. iron oxide, chromous oxide, or zinc hydroxide, may be inhibited. Any unsaturated carboxylic acid or its salt may be used to prepare the polymer a . Examples are given above. The preferred carboxylic acids are acrylic acid and methacrylic acid. Any unsaturated sulfonic acid or its salt may be used in producing the polymer a . Examples are given above. The preferred sulfonic acid is 2acrylamido 2 methylpropylsulfonic acid. Polymer a may be prepared from more than two monomers.Monomers other than carboxylic and sulfonic acids or their salts may be present in the polymer. Mixtures of the polymers may be used. The weight ratio of carboxylic acid to sulfonic acid is 1 20 to 20 1, preferably 1 10 to 10 1, and particularly 4 1 to 1 4. Any water soluble polycarboxylate may be used as component b .Examples include polymers derived from homo andtor copolymers including terpolymers, tetra , etc. of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, vinyl acetic acid, allyl acetic acid, fumaric acid, phosphinocarboxylic acid, maleic acid or anhydride, itaconic acid, a halo acrylic acid and ss carboxyethyl acrylate.

Additional phosphonates are identified in U.S. Patent 3,837,803, which is hereby incorporated by reference. The preferred phosphonates are 2 phosphono l , 2, 4 tricarboxybutane, amino tri methylene phosphonic acid and hydroxyetbylidene diphosphonic acid. Any water soluble phosphate may be used as component b . Examples include orthophosphate condensed phosphates, such as sodium hexametaphosphate phosphate esters organophosphate esters, such as the lower alkyl mono , di and trialkyl phosphates. The alkyl group is selected from C1 to C4 and may be branched or unbranched. The alkyl group may be substituted with hydroxy, amino, halide, sulfate or sulfonate, alone or in combination and molecularly dehydrated phosphates. Any water soluble metal salt may be used as component b . Examples include water soluble salts of zinc, molybdenum, chromate and sodium silicate and mixtures thereof. The combination of zinc and chromate were found especially effective. The polymer stabilizes the zinc ion and prevents its precipitation at high pH. Any water soluble sulfonate containing polymer may be used as component b . Examples include homo and or copolymers of 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropylsul fonic acid, 2 methacrylamido 2 methylpropylsùlfonic acid, styrene sulfonic acid, vinyl sulfonic acid, sulfo alkyl acrylate or methacrylate, allyl or methallyl sulfonic acid, sulfonic acid acrylate, 3 methacrylamido 2 hydroxy propyl sulfonic acid, their salts and mixtures thereof. It is possible that the carboxylic acid, from which the polycarboxylate used as component b is prepared, is the same carboxylic acid used to prepare the polymer of component a . However, the carboxylic acid used to prepare component b is not polymerized with the same sulfonic acid as a . The same is true with regards to the sulfonate. The weight ratio of component a to component b is preferably 1 50 to 50 1, more preferably 1 10 to 10 1. It is preferred that component a be a copolymer. The carboxylic acid sulfonic acid polymer was found, in addition, to enhance the effectiveness of the water soluble polycarboxylates, phosphonates, polyphosphates, phosphates, metal salts and sul fonates. Calcium phosphate scale is a particular problem at a pH of 7 to 9. The admixtures of the instant invention were surprisingly found to be effective at a pH 7 to 9 and at temperatures ranging from 0 to 80 C. The admixtures of the instant invention are, of course, effective over a broad pH range e.g. less than 7 and to some extent, greater than 9 . The admixture is used at a minimum dosage of 0.1 mg l in inhibiting scale and corrosion, preferably in a dosage of 1 to 100 mg l, most preferably 1 to 15 mg l. It is preferred that component a have a weight average molecular weight of less than 25,000, preferably less than 15,000, most preferably less than 10,000, as determined by low angle laser light scattering. The admixture was found to be synergistic in that the admixture inhibited scale and corrosion to a greater extent than expected.

AA AS copolymer of acrylic acid and allyl sulfonic acid.Examples 1 through 65 Synergism between copolymers of carboxylic acids and sulfonic acids and other building blocks were screened for threshold inhibition of calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate and calcium phosphate.Stagnant flask tests were used with solutions stored for 24 hours at constant temperature. The standard test conditions used were as follows Calcium Calcium Calcium Carbonate Sulfate PhosphateCalcium, mg l 200 2000 200Bicarbonate, mg l 600Sulfate, mg l 4800Phosphate, mg l 4 pH 8.0 8.2 7.0 8.5 Temperature, C 65 65 60 Four flasks were used for each test one for a control no inhibitor , one with the copolymer alone, one with the other inhibitor alone, and the last with both inhibitors.For all inhibitors, a level of inhibitor was picked which by itself would give 0 to 50 percent inhibition as determined by the following equation 5T 5c Percent Inhibition x 100 where Si 5c SI level of test species initially Sc level of test species at end of control test and 5T level of test species at end of inhibitor test. Calcium was used as the test species in the calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate tests, and phosphate was the test species in the calcium phosphate test. Synergism was determined by comparing the percent inhibition obtained using both inhibitors, each at the same level as used alone, with the sum of the inhibition obtained using the inhibitors alone. The results are summarized inTables I, II and III.Examples 66 through 85 Synergism data on the inhibition of iron oxide deposition by a combination of the copolymer and other building blocks was determined by zeta potential measurements. The test solution consisted of 500 mg i iron oxide foe203 and O.O1M sodium nitrate for ionic strength at pH 7.1 to 7.2.Caustic was used to adjust the pH. The test solutions were treated with 1.0 mg l of the copolymer and the various building blocks, alone or with a combination of 0.5 mg l of the copolymer of and 0.5 mg l of the other building block. The pH of the test solution was readjusted to 7.1 to 7.2, if necessary. The change in zeta potential of the control without inhibitor with the inhibited solutions was determined. Synergism was noted when that change was greater in the solutions treated by the combination of building blocks than with the building blocks alone. The results are summarized in Table IV.Examples 86 through 104 The synergistic effects of the AA AMPS copolymer and other building blocks for corrosion inhibition were determined in eight liter test cells using synthetic four cycle Pittsburgh water at pH 7.5.The tests were run for 7 days at a constant temperature of 50 C. Two steel test coupons 1 inch x 2 inches were suspended on glass rods in each test cell. The test solution was constantly agitated by a submersible pump and air was constantly bubbled through the solution to keep it saturated. The various test solutions were treated with theAA AMPS copolymer and the other building blocks, alone or with a combination of the copolymer and another building block. Synergism was determined by comparing the corrosion rates obtained on the test coupons from the cells containing the individual inhibitors with those from the cell containing the combination of inhibitors. The results are summarized in Table V.Example 105 The effect of the AA AMPS copolymer in inhibiting the precipitation of calcium HEDP hydroxyethylidene diphosphonic acid, a common scale inhibitor precipitation was tested using synthetic four cycle Pittsburgh water at pH 8.5. The tests were run for the number of days indicated at a constant temperature of 50 C. Thirty mg l of HEDP was added. Fifty three percent of the HEDP remained in solution in the absence of the copolymer. The turbidity was also measured and found to be 9 NTU.Ninety percent remained in solution when 15 mg l, active, of a 60 40 AA AMPS copolymer was added and the turbidity was 1.5 NTU. The effect of the 60 40 AA AMPS copolymer in preventing calcium HEDP precipitation in industrial water was tested at pH 8.5 at a constant temperature of 50 C. The results are summarized in Table VI. Example 106 Forty grams of zinc ion were added to 8 liters of Pittsburgh tap water which had been concentrated 4 times. Ten experiments were run, five without additive and five with 10 mg l of 60 40 AA AMPS.The temperature of the test solutions was maintained at 50 C. The pH of the five solutins without additive was 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5 and 9.0, respectively. The pH of the five additive containing solutions was likewise 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5 and 9.0, respectively. Samples were taken after one and three days from each of the solutions. The samples were filtered and the zinc ion concentration determined by atomic adsorption spectrometry. The results are summarized in TableVII. Both solutions at pH 9 contained 0.25 mg l AMP to prevent any CaCO3 precipitation and interference at the high pH with the zinc data.Example 107 3.1 grams of CrO3 in 500 ml of distilled water was reduced to Cr 3 with 25 ml of NaHSO3. The pH was adjusted to 11 and the solution was stirred for 45 minutes. 20 ml of the mixture was added to 180 ml of Pittsburgh tap water which had been concentrated 4 times. The solution was split in two samples. 15 mg l of active of 60 40 AA AMPS was added to one of the samples. The two samples were shaken. In the sample without the additive, the precipitate settled after 5 minutes, while the sample containing the additive retained a blue turbidity and precipitate took much longer to settle. The effect was quantified using a Brinkmann colorimeter at 450 nm. The sample with no additive had a 69.1 percent change in transmittance after 7 minutes, while the sample with additive had only a 3.7 percent change in transmittance.Example 108 The change in percent transmittance of iron oxide containing BOF water and various dispersants was determined using the fiber optics probe from aBrinkmann PC l000 colorimeter. The percent dispersant effectiveness was calculated from the following A transmittance with dispersant 100 1 A transmittance without dispersantThe iron oxide containing BOF water was an industrial steel water sample characterized as follows Total Dissolved Ion mg l mg l C03 24HCO3 968 C1 110SiO2 1.5 SOz 200Orthophosphate 40.05 Polyphospha te 0.1Organic Phosphate 0.1Fluoride 32Iron 855 0.05Calcium 560 19Magnesium 152 34Suspended Solids 3500 3.5E The percent dispersion effectiveness of various concentrations of additive to disperse iron oxide inBOF scrubber water at a pH of 8.8 is summarized inTable VIII.Example 109 Polyphosphate Stabilization The ability of 60 40 AA AMPS to stabilize polyphosphate hexametaphosphate was determined by measuring the reversion of polyphosphate to orthophosphate. 250 mg l HCO3 was added to 8 liters of water characterized as follows Ion mg l Ca 400 Mg 48 SOW 788 Cl 708 HCO 3 250 which had been concentrated 4 times. The pH was 8.5 and the temperature was 50 C. After 7 days, using 10 mg l hexametaphosphate 9.0 mg l PO4 , there was 0.433 mug 1 total PO4 still in solution.
