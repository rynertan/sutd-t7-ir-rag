# Process for manufacture of soft absorbent tissue paper and paper made thereby.

## Abstract
Tissue paper webs useful in the manufacture of soft, absorbent products such as paper towels, and processes for making the webs. The process comprises the steps of forming an aqueous papermaking furnish from paper pulp, at least one specified quaternary ammonium compound and at least one specified nonionic surfactant. The quaternary ammonium compounds are trimethylalkyl, trimethylal kylene, methylpolyoxyethylene alkyl and methylpolyox yethylene alkylene quaternary ammonium compounds. The nonionic surfactants are ethylene oxide adducts of fatty alcohols and fatty acids. The second and third steps in the basic process are the deposition of the papermaking furnish onto a foraminous surface such as a Fordrinier wire and removal of the water from the deposited furnish. An alternate process involves the use of the furnish containing the quaternary ammonium compounds and the nonionic surfactants in a papermaking process which will produce a pattern densified fibrous web having a relatively high bulk field of relatively low fiber density in a patterned array of spaced zones of relatively high fiber density.
