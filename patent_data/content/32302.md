# Organ stop control apparatus.

## Abstract
Stop control apparatus for an organ includes a latching circuit for each stop and an elongate support panel 12 on which modular groups of touch sensitive switches 50, 52, etc. are disposed in pairs 50,52 with an indicating lamp 34 disposed between the switches of each pair, wherein the switches of the pair cause the latching circuit to actuate and de actuate a given stop while the lamp indicates whether the stop is actuated. The touch sensitive switches are usually overlaid with a flexible front surface layer 16 through which the switches are operable by touch of the layer and through which the indicating lamps are visible only when energised. The lamps extend through holes 18 in the support panel and corresponding holes 58 or 53 in the switch membranes 14 , the arrangement being such that either two stops or one stop are controlled in a given column, and the control panel is universal for organs with different stop combinations. The surface layer has printed thereon a plurality of colour contrasting outlines 60 , each positioned to circumscribe a different pair of switches and associated indicating lamp to facilitate stop selection, the surface layer otherwise having a dead front appearance.
