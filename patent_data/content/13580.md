# A method for cooling a gas stream and a steam generating heat exchanger using said method.

## Abstract
A steam generating heat exchanger of modular design for cooling a high pressure, hot combustible gas laden with molten ash particles comprising a first convective cooler 18 having a vertically orientated U shaped gas pass housing a superheater and an evaporator, a radiant cooler 6 disposed upstream of the first convective cooler and a second convec tive cooler 40 housing an economizer disposed downstream of the first convective cooler. In line tube bundles form the superheat, evaporator, and the economizer thereby minimizing ash deposition upon the heat transfer surface. The gas velocity within the radiant cooler is maintained low enough to permit molten ash particles entrained in the gas to coalesce and precipitate out of the gas stream, while the gas velocity within the convective coolers is maintained high enough to discourage ash deposition upon the heat transfer surface.
