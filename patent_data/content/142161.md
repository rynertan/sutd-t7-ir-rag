# Apparatus for processing EKG signals.

## Abstract
An apparatus for processing EKG signals having pace pulses therein is disclosed in which a pulse is substituted for the pace pulse and the after voltage following a pace pulse is prevented from reaching the output. The substitute pulse is derived from the pace pulse so that its amplitude is propor tional to a parameter of the pace pulse, for example to the amplitude, the width or the product of the amplitude and the width of the pace pulse.
