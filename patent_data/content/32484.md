## Description
BACKGROUND OF TdF 1NV5NT10N The present invention relates to a multiple use scissors unit,particularly for electricians. As it is known,several types of scissors are presently available comprising a pair of blades, of any suitable snapes,in cross wise relationsnip one to anotner and pivoted at an intermediate position thereof. More specifically,considering tne electrician scissors,these latter practically differ from the conventional scissors only due to the provision of an electrically insulating layer material,as coated on tne nandle ends. Furtnermore these scissors may nave opposite seats acting for peeling off the wire sheath. While these scissors are universally used, tney have been found susceptible to improvements,mainly with respect to their flexibility of operation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly tne main object of tne present invention is to provide a multiple use scissors unit wnich,in addition to tue conventional cutting properties, is effective to carry out otter operations of great utility for tne electricians and,obviously,well accepted to other users. Anotner object of tie present invention is to provide a scissors unit waici,while affording greatly improved characteristics, is of simple construction like the conventional scissors. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a scissors unit which is particularly advantageous from an economic point of view. Tke aforesaid and otner objects,whici will become more apparent hereinafter,are achieved by a multiple use scissors unit,particularly for electricians,comprising a first and second blades, in cross wise relationship and pivoted at an intermediate portion tnereof,handle ring members being provided at one end of said blades,cbaracterized in that at the free end of at least one said blade a flattened lug is provided in the shape of a screwdriver end or point. BRIEF DESCRIPTIION OF THE DRAWING Further characteristics and avantages will become more apparent from the following detailed description of a multiple use scissors unittparticularly for electricians,being illustrated by way of an indicative but not limitative example in the accompanying drawing tae sole figure whereof shows the scissors unit according to the invention. DESCRlPTlON OF TIRE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring now to tne number references of tne drawing,the multiple use scissors unit,particularly for electricians,generally indicated at l,comprises a first blade 2 and a second blade 3. The blades 2 and 3,as it is conventional, are in cross wise relationsnip at an intermediate portion thereof,beinqpivotea tnrougn a tnreaded pin 5 which couples the blade 2 and 3 one to another. At one end thereof the blades 2 and 3 are provided with handle ring members,indicated at 4, which may nave any suitable shapes. Advantageously,for tne specific use in the electrical field,the handle portions are covered or coated by an electrically insulating plastics material layer effective to provide a good electrical insu latin. Tne main characteristic of the invention is that,at the end of the first blade 2,there is provided a flattened lug 6 of screwdriver end or point shape. More specifically, the flattened lug 6. is formed on the extension of said blade 2,in such a way as to provide the user with the possibility of gripping the scissors as a conventional screwdriver, by using the flattened lug 6 for screwing on or off. It is conceptually also possible,if it is desired,to provide,on both blades,two flattenedlugs 6,of different size,in order to obtain two screwdrivers of different size,depending on the specific provided use. It should also be noted that,at an intermediate portion of the blades 2 and 3,opposite seats or housing recesses are provided, indicated at 7, effective to conventionally act as wire sheath peeling off members. From the above description it will be self evident the way for using the scissors unit according to the invention. Actually, the thereinabove illustrated scissors can be used as a conventional scissors pair, for carrying out the cutting operations and tae wire sneatn peeling off operations. Tn difference,with respect to the conventional scissors,is that,at the free end of a blade a screwdriver point is formedfthereby providing tne user with tee possibility of immediately using an useful tool,sueh as a screwdriver. For using the scissors as a screwdriver, tney have preferably to be in the closed condition thereof and tne user will grip the scissors as it would be gripped tne body of a screwdriver the working end whereof is formed by the flattened lug 6. From the above description it should be noted that the invention fully achieves its objects. More spec i fically it is to be pointed out that the multiple use scissors unit,according.to tne invention,affords the possibility of having at disposal, immediately,an effectively practical screwdriver which is of great utility for an electrician who has frequently to screw on or off clamp member in order to couple electric wires or cables. In practicing tne invention the used materials,tbough they are compatible with the intended use,as well as the specific size and sLapes,can be any,according to the needs.
