# Process for preparing squaraine compounds.

## Abstract
This invention is generally directed to an improved process for the preparation of squaraine compositions which comprises the reaction of squaric acid with an aromatic aniline in the presence of an aliphatic amine, wherein there results a product of reduced dark decay properties and increased charge acceptance values as compared to squaraine compositions prepared from the squaric acid process in the absence of an aliphatic amine.
