# I2L logic circuit.

## Abstract
An I²L logic circuit provided with a logic section 126 which includes at least one I²L unit circuit 120 formed of a transistor for injector 122 and a driving transistor 124 . The I²L logic circuit is further provided with a supply circuit for supplying the I²L unit circuit with an injector current corresponding to a control signal. The supply circuit is formed of a first circuit 132 for steadily supplying the I²L unit circuit 120 with a predetermined injector current, and a second circuit 136 for supplying the I²L unit circuit 120 with another injector current in accordance with the control signal, the first and second circuits 132, 136 being connected in parallel with each other.
