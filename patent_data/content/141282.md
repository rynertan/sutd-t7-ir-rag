# Method of and system for real time differential pulse detection.

## Abstract
An electrochemical detection cell 70 which includes a first membrane 21 , an electrode carrier 22 having refer ence electrode 34 and counter electrode 35 thereon, a membrane support 25 , an electrode carrier 27 having a sensing electrode 33 thereon, and a permselective mem brane 28 . Whatman filter papers 23,24,26 are positioned between the sensing electrode 33 and both the counter electrode 35 and reference electrode 34 . The cell 70 allows air or gas ambient to address the membranes 21,28 and effects application of an electrolyte to the space between the electrodes by, for example, a wick 47 which extends between an electrolyte containing reservoir 13 and the Whatman filter papers 23,24,26 . A system for detecting a gaseous agent uses the aforementioned detecting cell 70 coupled with circuitry capable of applying a fixed D.C. voltage bias to the reference electrode 34 and superimpos ing a train of D.C. voltage pulses on the fixed bias. Further circuitry 68, 98 111 is coupled to and responsive to signals from the sensing electrode 33 . This circuitry 68, 98 111 determines the difference between the sensing electrode 33 signal at the end of each pulse minus that just before each pulse. The difference is proportional to the concentration of the test gas in the atmosphere adjacent to the sensor 33 , and is a more specific and sensitive indication of the test gas concentration than prior art sensors.
