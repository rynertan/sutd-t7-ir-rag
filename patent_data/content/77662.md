# Preparation of nitroarylacetic acid esters and derivatives thereof.

## Abstract
Nitroarylacetic acid esters may be prepared by reacting a nitroaromatic compound with an alpha substituted mono carboxylic acid ester, e.g. an alphas, alpha disubstituted acetic acid ester, in a substantially anhydrous aprotic solvent and in the presence of a base so that the ester undergoes a nucleophilic substitution on an unsubstituted ring carbon of the nitroaromatic compound during which an alpha substituent functions as a leaving group. The nitroarylacetic acid esters formed by the process can be readily converted into derivatives, such as pharmaceuticals.

## Description
PRE2ARATICN OF NITROARYLACETIC ACID ESTERS ANDDERIVATIVES THEREOF This invention relates to processes for preparing nitroarylacetic acid esters and derivatives thereof. There are known techniques of preparing profen type pharmaceuticals and other materials having a relatively complex aryl group attached to the alpha carbon of a substituted or unsubstituted acetic acid. For example, U. S. patents 3,755,427 Adams et al. , 3,959,364 Armitage et al. and 4,278,516 Zaiko et al. disclose processes for converting various starting materials into flurbiprofen, i.e., 2 2 fluoro 4 biphenylyl propionic acid, and similar compounds having anti inflnmmstory, analgesic, and anti pyretic properties Carney et al., A PotentNon Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Agent 2 13 Chloro 4 3 pyrrolinyl phenyl propionic Acid, Experientia, Vol. 29, page 938 1972 teach, inter alia, tbe preparation of their anti inflammatory agent also known as pirprofen via an ethyl 2 3 chloro 4nitrobenzene propionate intermediate U. S. Patent 4,239,901 Rainer shows that pyrazol l ylphenyl and pyrazolin l ylphenylacetic acids having anti inflammatory properties can be synthesized from various intermediates, including polychloronitrobenzeneacetic acid esters ad it is known that indoprofen, i.e., 2 4 1,3 dihydro 1 oxo 2H isoindol 2 yl phenyl propionic acid, and indobufen, i.e., 2 4 1,3 dihydrol oxo 2H isoindol 2 yl phenyl butyric acid, can be prepared from the appropriate 2 4 nitrobenzene alphaalkylacetic acids. Nitroarylacetic acids and their esters, as well as the amino derivatives thereof, have been found to be particularly useful intermediates for the synthesis of these pharmaceuticals. However, in the past, a disadvantage of employing them as pharmaceutical intermediates has been the difficulty of preparing them by conventional techniques. Even the preferred procedures for preparing them have proven to be difficult, tedious, and time consuming, as evidenced byExample 23 of U. S. Patent 3,868,391 Carney et al. II and Example 16 of Rainer, both of which show the use of days of refluxing to accomplish only a portion of their syntheses. It would obviously be a wel come contribution to the art to provide a method of synthesizing nitrobenzeneacetic acid esters and analogs and derivatives thereof in a simple and straightforward manner. Thts invention aims to provide processes for preparing nitroarylacetic acid esters in moderateto good yield with high selectivity in a simple and straightforward manner. In addition, novel processes for preparing derivatives of the esters are provided. The invention provides a process comprising reacting a nitroaromatic compound with an alphasubstituted monocarboxylic acid, e.gt an alpha, alpha disubstituted acetic acid ester, in a substantially anhydrous aprotic solvent and in the presence of a base so that the ester undergoes a nucleophilic substitution on an unsubstituted ring carbon of the nitroaromatic compound during which an alpha substituent functions as a leaving group, thereby forming a nitroarylacetic acid ester, and, when appropriate, b converting the nitroarylacetic acid ester to a desired derivative thereof. Nitroaromatic compounds utilizable in the practice of the invention include a variety of such compounds the chief requirements for their utility being that 1 they bear at least one nitro substituent on an aromatic ring, 2 they contain at least one replaceable hydrogen on an aromatic ring to which a nitro group is attached, and 3 they are devoid of substituents which would interfere with the desired nucleophilic substitution reaction, e. g., substituents bearing an acidic proton, such as NH2, OH, SH, NHR, etc. Thus, the utilizable nitroaromatic compounds include compounds having one or more simple or fused aromatic rings containing five or six members and either bearing no substituents other than nitro substituents, or also bearing any of a variety of inert substituents, i.e., substituents that do not interfere with the desired nucleophilic substitution reaction, such as halo, alkyl, alkoxy, alkylmercapto, trifluoromethyl, dialkylamino, dialkanoylamino, cyano, alkyl carbamoyl, alkylsulfonyl, dialkylsulfamoyl, alkoxyalkyl, haloalkyl, cycloalkyl, halocycloalkyl, etc. any alkyl chains in the substituents generally being lower alkyl chains. Lower alkyl is used in this specification in its usual sense to refer to an alkyl group containing up to about 6 carbons. When the nitroaromatic compound contains more than one ring, any such inert substituent may be on the same ring as the ring bearing a nitro substituent and or on a ring which is directly or indirectly attached to the ring bearing a nitro substituent. When the aromatic ring bearing the required nitro substituent is a six membered ring, there will be at least one replaceable hydrogen in a position para or ortho to the carbon bearing the nitro substituent and it is preferred that there be a replaceable hydrogen in the para position. Nitroaromatic compounds having a five membered ring should have a replaceable hydrogen on a carbon adjacent to, or separated by two ring atoms from, the carbon bearing the nitro substituent. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, the nitroaromatic compound is a compound which is devoid of halogen on the aromatic ring bearing the required nitro group. Illustrative of such compounds are heterocyclic compounds which preferably contain five or six membered rings having aromatic character, such as nitropyridine N oxide, 5 nitroisoquinoline, 5 and 6 nitroquinolines, 2 nitrothiophene, etc. fused ring aromatic compounds, such as the 1 and 2 nitronapthalenes, etc. aromatic compounds containing a plurality of simple rings, such as the 2 , 3 , and 4 nitrobiphenyls, the 2 , 3 , and 4 benzylnitrobenzenes, 2 nitrodiphenyl ether, etc. and aromatic compounds containing a single simple ring, such as nitrobenzene, 2 methylnitrobenzene, the 2,3 , 2,5 , and 3,5 dimethylnitrobenzenes, the 2,4 and 2,6 diethylnitrobenzenes, 3,4 dibutylnitrobenzene, the 1,2 and 1,3 dinitrobenzenes, 2,6 dinitrotoluene, the 1,2,3 and 1,2,4 trinitrobenzenes, 2 nitro N,N diethylaniline, 4 nitro N ethylacetanilide, 2 nitrobenzylcyanide, 2 nitrophenyl acetate, etc. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, the nitroaromatic compound is a compound which bears at least one halo substituent on the aromatic ring bearing the required nitro group.Exemplary of such compounds are the 2 , 3 , and 4 chloronitrobenzenes the 2,3 , 2,4 , 2,5 2,6 , 3,4 , and 3,5 dichloronitrobenzenes the various trichloronitrobenzenes the corresponding fluoro, bromo and iodo compounds the various dimethyl , diethyl , and dibutylnitrobenzenes, nitrobiphenyls, benzylnitrobenzenes, nitronaphthalenes, di and trinitrobenzenes, nitro N,N diethylanilines, nitrodiphenyl esters, nitroN ethylacetanilides, nitrobenzylcyanides, nitrophenyl acetates, nitropyridine N oxides, nitroquinolines, nitroisoquinolines, nitrothiophenes, and the like bearing one or more ar chloro, fluoro, bromo, or iodo substituents and containing at least one replaceable hydrogen in an appropriate position. Since there is a tendency for iodo substituents to be removed under the conditions of the substitution reaction of the invention, the preferred halonitroaromatic compounds are those in which the halo substituents are fluoro, chloro, or bromo, most preferably fluoro or chloro. In some cases, polynitroaromatic reactants may undergo substitution reactions whereby one of the nitro groups is replaced by the ester reactant. Therefore, the possibility of this competitive reaction should be kept in mind when selecting a polynitroaromatic for use in the process. In each of the aforementioned embodiments of the invention, the preferred nitroaromatic compounds are nitrobenzenes having a replaceable hydrogen in the position para to the nitro group, since the nucleophilic substitution reaction of the invention tends to be highly selective on the para position, and the use of such compounds therefore leads to the production of nitrobenzeneacetic acid esters which are ideally suited for the synthesis of anti inflammatory agents of the type described in the aforementioned references. Even more preferred in the case of the halonitrobenzenes are such nitrobenzenes having a halo substituent in a position ortho to the nitro group.Halonitrobenzenes which are especially preferred are 2 chloronitrobenzene and 2 fluoronitrobenzene, which are readily converted with high selectivity into such products as chloro 4 3 pyrrolinyl phenyl propionic acid, 2 2fluoro 4 biphenylyl propionic acid and related anti inflammatory agents. A non halogenated nitroaromatic compound that is particularly preferred is nitrobenzene, which is readily converted with high selectivity into pharmaceutically active agents such as 2 4 1, 3 dihydro l oxo 2H isoindol 2 yl phenyli propionic acid, 2 4 l,3 dihydro l oxo 2H isoindol 2 yl phenyl butyric acid, and analogs thereof. The alpha,alpha disubstituted acetic acid esters that can be used in the practice of the invention also include a variety of such compounds, which in general may be represented by the formula EMI8.1 wherein L is a leaving group R is halo preferably chloro or more preferably a hydrocarbyl e.g., alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, aryl, aralkyl, etc. or hydrocarbyloxy bydrocarbyl e. g., alkoxyalkyl, aryloxyalkyl, alkoxyaryl, alkoxy cycloalkyl, etc. group which most preferably contains up to about 1 carbons and R is a hydrocarbyl group which preferably contains up to about 10 carbons and most preferably is an alkyl group. Exemplary leaving groups, L, include halo, aryloxy, haloaryloxy, alkylthio, cycloalkylthio, arylthio, aralkylthio, haloalkylthio, halocycloalkylthio, haloarylthio, haloaralkylthio, or less preferably alkoxy, cycloalkoxy, aralkoxy, baloalkoxy, halocycloalkoxy, haloaralkoxy, and the like, as well as other suitable leaving groups which have been described in the literature, e.g., in Golinski et al., Vicarious Nucleophilic Substitution of Hydrogen in Aromatic NitroCompounds, Tetrahedron Letters, Vol. 37, pp. 3495 8 1978 and in Makosza et al., Vicarious Substitution of Hydrogen in Aromatic Nitro Compounds withAcetonitrile Derivatives , Journal of OrganicChemistry, Vol. 45, pp. 1534 5 1980 . When the leaving group is an organic group, it is generally preferred that the group which does not remain in the product contain not more than about 10 carbons, although organic leaving groups having an even higher carbon content are satisfactory in the practice of the invention. Preferably, the leaving group is halo, i.e., chloro, bromo, fluoro, or iodo and it is more preferably chloro or bromo, most preferably chloro. A few examples of utilizable alpha,alphadisubstituted acetic acid esters are alpha chloropropionates such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, t butyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl, and benzyl 2 chloropropionates the corresponding alpha bromopropionates and other alpha substituted monocarboxylic acid esters such as methyl 2 methylmercaptopropionate ethyl 2 butylmercapto propionate, methyl 2 phenoxybutyrate, phenyl 2 methylmercapto propionate, butyl 2 cyclohexylmercaptovalerate, methyl 2 4 fluorophenoxy propionate, and the like. The alpha haloalpha hydrocarbylacetic acid esters, i.e., esters of alpha halomonocarboxylic acids containing at least three carbons, are especially preferred, although similar esters in which the alpha halo substituent is replaced by one of the other leaving groups mentioned above are also highly desirable. In another highly desirable emobodiment of the invention, the alpha,alpha disubstituted acetic acid ester is an alpha,alpha dihaloacetic acid ester, most preferably an alpha,alpha dichloroacetic acid ester, which leads to the formation of a product having a reactive halo substituent in the alpha position, e.g., a product corresponding to the formula EMI10.1 wherein X is halo, preferably chloro R is a hydrocarbyl group, preferably containing up to about 10 carbons and n is an integer of 1 to 3. Such products enable facile synthesis of a variety of end products.Most preferably the nitro group is in the position para to the ester substituent, although it may be located in an ortho position. Illustrative aprotic solvents which may be employed in the process of the invention include ethers such as diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, l ethoxyhexane, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4 dioxane, 1,3 dioxolane, diglyme, 1,2 diethoxyethane, anisole, etc. tertiary amines such as pyridine, N ethylpiperidine, triethyl amine, tributyl amine, N,N diphenyl N methyl amine, N,Ndimethylaniline, etc. and other aprotic solvents.However, the preferred aprotic solvents are dipolar aprotic solvents such as dimethyl sulfoxide, N,Ndimethylformamide, N,N dimethylacetamide, dimethyl sulfone, tetramethylene sulfone, N methylpyrrolidone, and the like. Bases useful in the practice of the invention include all bases strong enough to activate the ester reactant, e.g., alkaline earth metal compounds such as calcium oxide, calcium hydride, calcium hydroxide, barium oxide, barium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, zinc hydroxide, etc. However, the base is preferably an alkali metal compound, e.g., an organoalkali metal compound, alkali metal hydride, alkali metal hydroxide, alkali metal oxide, alkali metal amide, or alkali metal alcoholate, such as butyllithium, phenyllithium, ethylsodium, amylsodium, butylpotassium, benzylpotassium, sodium dimsylate i.e., the sodium salt of diethylsulfoxide , sodium hydride, potassium hydride, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium oxide, potassium oxide, sodium amide, potassium amide, lithium diisopropylamide, sodium methoxide, potassium t butoxide, the sodium salt of the monomethylether of ethylene glycol, sodium phenoxide, and the like. Ordinarily the use of sodium hydride or potassium hydride will be found most convenient and economical. Use of an alkali metal compound as the base permits the alternatives of using the alkali metal compound alone or in conjunction with a phase transfer catalyst, such as a quaternary ammonium salt, ethylene glycol, or a suitable crown ether. When a phase transfer catalyst is employed 1 the alkali metal compound may be any of the alkali metal compounds generically or specifically indicated above, although the type of alkali metal compound being used determines the type of crown ether that is preferably utilized lithium bases generally calling for the use of a 12crown 4 ether, sodium bases generally calling for the use of a 15 crown 5 ether, and potassium bases generally calling for the use of an 18 crown 6 ether, and 2 the reaction medium may be any of the aprotic solvents mentioned above, or it may be an inert liquid hydrocarbon such as benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, heptane, isooctane, or the like. When an alkali metal hydride, especially a highly pure alkali metal hydride, is employed as the base, it is desirable to include a small amount of a transfer agent such as water, alcohol, or the like in the system. It is believed that the transfer agent activates the hydride by reacting therewith to form a small amount of the alkali metal hydroxide or alcoholate. The nitroarylacetic acid ester synthesis of the invention is conducted in a substantially anhydrous reaction system, and accordingly, except when a small amount of water which is itself consumed by reaction with the alkali metal hydride , is employed as a transfer agent, the components of the reaction system should be brought together and maintained under a dry inert atmosphere. Thus, while it is possible to conduct the process in the presence of air, it is desirable to maintain the reaction system under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen or the like. Since the reaction itself is normally an exothermic reaction, with its initiation readily ascertainable by noting the exotherm produced, the reactants are ordinarily brought together at ambient temperatures, although the temperature may be raised or lowered to suit the needs of the occasion if desired. The nitroaromatic compound and alpha, alpha disubstituted acetic acid ester may be used in amounts such as to provide a stoichiometric excess of either of the reactants or the stoichiometric amount of each. However, when a stoichiometric excess of the nitroaromatic compound is employed, the quantity of product obtainable will be limited by the quantity of ester used, so it is desirable to utilize a stoichiometric excess of the ester. The amount of base employed is preferably such as to provide at least two molar equivalents of base per mol of nitroaromatic compound, since the use of smaller amounts although permitting the reaction to occur makes the base the limiting reagent. The mode of addition of the ingredients of the reaction system is not particularly critical. Accordingly, it is convenient to add the nitroaromatic compound to a mixture of the other materials, add the base to a mixture of the other materials, add the reactants to a mixture of the base and aprotic solvent, introduce all four ingredients simultaneously into the reaction zone, or the like. Since the reaction ordinarily proceeds very rapidly, long reaction times are not required. The reaction will usually be completed within a matter of minutes or a few hours at ambient temperatures. When derivatives of the nitroarylacetic acid esters are desired, they may be prepared by employing conventional techniques to convert to the desired derivatives the nitroarylacetic acid esters made in accordance with the present invention. Thus, for example A an alkyl 2 4 nitrobenzene propionate or an alkyl 2 3 chloro 4 nitrobenzene propionate synthesized by the process of this invention may be hydrogenated to an alkyl 2 4 aminobenzene propionate, which in turn may be reacted with phthalic anhydride to form an alkyl 2 4 phthalimidophenyl propionate, which may be reduced and hydrolyzed to 2 4 1,3 dihydro 1 oxo 2H isoindol 2 yl phenyllpropionic acid, B an alkyl 2 3 chloro 4 nitrobenzene propionate synthesized by the process of this invention may be hydrolyzed to 2 3 chloro 4 nitrobenzene propionic acid, which in turn may be reduced to 2 4 aminobenzene propionic acid, reacted with phthalic anhydride to form 2 4 phtnalimidophenyl propionic acid and reduced to 2 4 1,3 dihydro 1 oxo 2H isoindol 2 yl phenyl propionic acid, and C an alkyl 2 3 fluoro 4 nitrobenzene propionate synthesized by the process of this invention may be selectively hydrogenated to an alkyl 2 4 amino3 fluorobenzene propionate, which in turn may be subjected to a Gomberg Bachmann reaction to replace the amino group with a phenyl group and form an alkyl 2 2 fluoro 4 biphenylyl propionate, which may be hydrolyzed to 2 2 fluoro 4 biphenylyl propionic acid. The particular conventional techniques used to convert the nitroarylacetic acid esters into their various derivatives are not critical. It may sometimes be desirable to use certain particular techniques for the preparation of the derivatives, e.g., the techniques taught in the aforementioned Carney et al. andCarney et al. II references. However, the overall processes for preparing the derivatives are simplified and made more efficient and economical by the present simplification of the synthesis of the nitroarylacetic acid esters, regardless of the particular techniques used to convert them into their various derivatives. The invention includes pharmaceutical or veterinary formulations comprising those of said derivatives which have therapeutic activity, in each case said derivatives being famxated for pharmaceutical or veterinary use, respectively. As indicated, the present invention is particularly advantageous in providing a readier and more economical route to the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other chemical products that can be prepared from nitroarylacetic acid esters. Such products include, not only those mentioned above, but a variety of products, such as products disclosed in U. S.Patents 3,641,040, 3,657,230, 3,767,805, 3,868,391, 3,936,467, 3,993,763, 3,997,669, 4,010,274, 4,118,504, 4,126,691, 4,163,788, and 4,239,901. The following Examples are given to illustrate the invention and are not intended as a limitation thereof.Synthesis of Nitroarylacetic Acid Esters Example 1 A flame dried flask was charged with 3.0 ml 26 mmols of 2 chloronitrobenzene, 2.9 ml 26 mmols of methyl 2 chloropropionate, and 25 ml of N,N dimethylformamide that had previously been dried over 3 Angstrom molecular sieves. The flask was supported in a water bath, and 1.5 g 31 mmols of sodium hydride were incrementally added over a period of 20 minutes as a 50 slurry in hydrocarbon oil. Upon the addition of the first incremental portion of the sodium hydride, the reaction mixture became red and thereafter turned deep purple as more of the base was added. After all of the sodium hydride had been charged to the flask, the mixture was stirred at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere for 18 hours.The reaction mixture was then poured into 1N HC1 and extracted with portions of diethyl ether to form ether layers which were combined, extracted with water, dried over MgSO4, and stripped to give a black oil. An aliquot of the oil was analyzed by means of a gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer GC MS and found to contain a product having the empirical formula C101110C1NO4. Another aliquot was subjected to preparative thin layer chromatography, and NMR analysis of the isolated product was consistent with the compound methyl 2 3 chloro 4 nitrobenzene propionate. Example 2 A flame dried flask was purged with nitrogen to provide an inert atmosphere and charged with 5.1 g 110 mmols of a 50 dispersion of sodium hydride in hydrocarbon oil. The sodium hydride was washed with 15 ml of petroleum ether b.p. 35 60 C. , after which the flask was charged with 15 ml of N,N dimethylformamide that had been dried over 3 Angstrom molecular sieves. Then a reaction mixture was formed by the dropwise addition, over 20 minutes, of a solution of 6 ml 51 mmols of 2 chloronitrobenzene and 6 ml 53 mmols of methyl 2 chloropropionate in 10 ml of N,Ndimethylformamide. The mixture turned purple and became hot during the dropwise addition. After completion of this addition, the reaction mixture was stirred for an additional 15 minutes, poured into 200 ml of 1N HC1, and extracted with three 150 ml portions of diethyl ether. The ether layers were combined, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated to give a black oil which was chrcatograpbed on a 200 g silica gel column eluted with 30 methylene chloride 70 petroleum ether. The appropriate fractions were combined and concentrated to afford 8.2 g of material which contained 94 by GC area percent , i.e., 7.7 g, of methyl 2 3 chloro 4 nitrobenzene propionate a yield of 62 . Example 3 Example 2 was repeated except that the 2 chloronitrobenzene 2 chloropropionate N,N dimethyl formamide solution was added over a period of 30 minutes during which the temperature of the reaction mixture was maintained at 25 30 C. by intermittent cooling with an ice water bath, and stirring of the reaction mixture was continued for 30 minutes after completion of this dropwise addition. The reaction mixture was then poured into 150 ml of 1N HC1 and extracted with four 150 ml portions of diethyl ether.The ether layers were combined, dried over MgS04, and concentrated to give an oil which was adsorbed on 15 g of silica gel 230 400 mesh . This was loaded on a column of 200 g of silica which was eluted with 30 dichloromethane 70 petroleum ether under nitrogen pressure to give 0.65 g of unreacted 2 chloronitrobenzene and 8.4 g of methyl 2 3 chloro 4 nitrobenzene propionate a yield of about 68 . Example 4 Into a flame dried flask under a blanket of nitrogen were placed 300 mg of a 50 dispersion of sodium hydride in hydrocarbon oil 6.3 mmols and 5 ml of N,N dimethylformamide. The flask was then charged with a solution of 0.56 ml 4.8 mmols of 2 chloronitrobenzene and 0.65 ml 5.0 mmols of ethyl 2 bromopropionate in 2 ml of N,N dimethylformamide, which was added dropwise over a period of 5 minutes. Upon the addition of the first drop of this solution, the mixture became orange red in color and about 5 minutes after the dropwise addition had been completed, the mixture turned deep purple, and a pronounced exotherm was noted. Then a second portion of sodium hydride 4.2 mmols was added, and another exotherm was observed. A small portion of the reaction mixture was then partitioned between 1N HC1 and diethyl ether.Analysis of the ether layer by GC MS indicated that ethyl 2 3 chloro 4 nitrobenzene propionate had been formed. Example 5 A flame dried flask was purged with nitrogen to provide an inert atmosphere and charged with 75 mg 1.9 mmols of a 60 dispersion of sodium hydride in mineral oil. This was washed with three 2 ml portions of petroleum ether b.p. 35 600C. and slurried in 1.0 ml of N,N dimethylformamide.A solution of 103 mg 0.65 mmol of 2 chloronitrobenzene and 126 mg 0.65 mmoi of ethyl 2 phenoxypropionate in 1.0 ml of N,N dimethylformamide was added dropwise to the sodium hydride slurry, and the resulting purple mixture was stirred for 45 minutes, after which it was poured into 20 ml of 1N HC1. The aqueous mixture was extracted with three 20 ml portions of diethyl ether, and the ether layers were combined, dried over MgS04, concentrated, and placed on a 2 mm silica gel thin layer chromatographic TLC plate. Elution of the plate with 50 petroleum ether 50 dichloromethane afforded 4.6 mg of 2 chloronitrobenzene, 15 mg of ethyl 2 phenoxypropionate, and 53 mg of ethyl 2 3 chloro 4 nitrobenzene propionate.
