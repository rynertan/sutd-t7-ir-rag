## Description
The present invention relates to a solid state image sensor and more particularly to a solid state image sensor of the type in which an electrical signal obtained by photoelectric conversion is directly converted into a digital signal, so that light information obtained from all picture elements is derived as digital signal. It is well known that degradation of S N ratio can be reduced largely by transmitting and processing various signals in the form of digital signal. From this point of view, even in the case of an image sensor, attempts have been made to convert a video signal into a digital signal in a stage as early as possible so that various processings of digital signals are carried out in the succeeding stages. In a prior art image sensor such as disclosed in US A 4086486 , however, even in a case that a signal obtained by photoelectric conversion is converted into a digital signal in an earlier stage, various analog information obtained from picture elements of a solid stage image sensor element is once derived from the elements as time sequential analog information, and then the analog information is converted into a digital signal through an analog to digital A D converter. That is, as shown in Fig. 1A, an analog signal derived from an image pickup tube 2A is applied through a buffer amplifier 4A to an A D converter 6A to obtain a digital signal. Alternatively, as shown in Fig. 1B, a signal derived from a solid state image sensor element 2B is applied through a buffer amplifier 4B to an A D converter 6B to obtain a digital signal. Video signals are processed in various manners, so that the processing as shown in Fig. 1A or 1B in which the video signal is processed after the signal is converted into the digital signal has a merit, but with the processing as shown in Fig. 1A or 1B, the processing of an analog signal in an image pickup element prior to the A D conversion is carried out in a conventional manner and the problems there are left unsolved. As a result, there is a disadvantage that a high quality image cannot be picked up, since an S N ratio cannot be improved to a satisfactory degree due to superposition of various noise. In view of the above, one of the aims of the present invention is to provide a solid state image sensor in which an electrical signal obtained by photoelectric conversion at each picture element is directly derived in the form of a digital signal and then the digital signal is directly served for processing. In order to acheive the above aim, the present invention provides a solid state image sensor comprising Here, the solid state image sensor may comprise means for correcting the count value in accordance with a peak value or a time duration of the pulse signal, when photons are incident upon the plurality of solid state photo sensors simultaneously or within a short period of time. Pulse signal correction means may be disposed between the plurality of solid state photo sensors and the counting and holding means and for correcting the pulse signal from the plurality of solid state photo sensors to a signal having a pulse width which is suitable for the counting by the counting and holding means. Each of the plurality of solid state photo sensors may include an avalanche photodiode or a micro channel plate. The plurality of solid state photo sensors may be arranged in the form of two dimension so that two dimensional video information is obtained from the plurality of solid state photo sensors. A digital signal derived from the scanning means may be applied to a digital signal processing stage for changing a signal level of the digital signal so that a video output with a required dynamic range is obtained from the digital signal processing stage. At least said plurality of photo sensors and said plurality of counting and holding circuits may be integrally formed as an integrated circuit. Specific embodiments of the present invention are now described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which In a solid state image sensor in accordance with the present invention, the number of incoming photons is measured in a digital form so that a digital signal is derived from each picture element. Therefore, first the number of incoming photons will be discussed. It is reported that the number of photons contained in one lumen per second is 0.4 x 10¹⁶ sec at the wavelength λ of 550 nm and is 1.3 x 10¹⁶ sec in the case of white light. It follows, therefore, that when the size of a picture element is about 10 x 10µm², the number of photons impinging against this picture element in an area having a plane illumination of one lux becomes in the case of white light. It becomes, therefore, possible to obtain a digital signal representative of an amount of light incident to the picture element by counting the number of photons. The number of photons given by equation 2 is Next, a frequency of photons striking a photosensor will be discussed. In the case of equation 1 , the number of photons per second is 1.3 x 10¹⁶ sec. If it is assumed that all the photons reach the photosensor at the same frequency, the frequency becomes 1.3 MHz. However, the striking frequency is in general considered to be at random, so that, at one time point, the frequency becomes 13 MHz in the case of the reception of photons at the density of 10 times higher and 130 MHz in the case of the reception of photons at the density of 100 times higher. Fig. 2 illustrates a probability Pn of the number Fig. 2 is obtained by redrafting Fig. 1 in Possibility of Optical Devices , Takeshi KAMIYA, Approach to Optical Computers , IV 4, p. 90 , March 1983 , Communication Laboratories Symposium, the University of Tohoku. As is clear from this graph, it is sufficient that a frequency response performance for distinguishing photons incident at a certain time point has a margin of about 10 times at the most that is, 13 MHz . It is further considered that an incoming light has a noise component and that the incoming photons at a high density at one time point may be considered to correspond to such a noise component. It follows, therefore, that noise can be reduced to a minimum when all of the high density photons are not counted. Therefore, in view of the above, it is sufficient that the frequency response is ten times as high as an average frequency 1.3 MHz and it is not needed to count photons at a frequency higher than the above described frequency. When it is required to count all of incident photons, a circuit for counting all incident photons can be provided in order to attain this counting, as will be described later. Fig. 3A is a schematic diagram showing a first embodiment of the present invention in which a line sensor is formed and arranged on a single wafer by a conventional IC production process. Fig. 3B shows photoelectric conversion means and counting and holding means in each picture element of the line sensor. In Figs. 3A and 3B, reference numerals 8A 8N designate photosensors each for generating a pulse signal corresponding to the number of incident photons and 10A 10N denote 16 23 bit pulse counters for counting the pulse signals derived from the photo sensors 8A 8N, respectively. 12A 12B are high speed photoelectron multiplying devices for instance, avalanche photodiodes arranged in one row over a light receiving surface 9 against which photons impinge. Alternatively, a micro channel plate MCP may be disposed on the light receiving surface 9 so that the photons multiplied by the MCP are received by the photodiodes 12A 12N. In the latter case, a photo sensitivity can be remarkably increased. Reference numeral 14 designates a horizontal scanning circuit for sequentially reading out the digital contents in the 16 23 bit counters 10A 10N when the counters are enabled. It is preferable to use a conventional address switching method in order to read out the contents by enabling the counters 10A 10N. Thus, the first embodiment provides a one dimensional solid state image sensor a so called line sensor . Each of the counters 10A 10N can be constructed by connecting in cascade a plurality of flip flops 11 each constituting one bit stage of the counter. Reference numeral 3 represents a power supply terminal 5, a reset terminal and 13, a buffer amplifier. Next, the mode of operation of the first embodiment with the above described arrangement will be described. First, within one frame time 1 30 second , the photodiodes 12A 12N generate the pulse signals which correspond in number to the incident photons. These pulse signals are applied to the counters 10A 10N and upon completion of counting incident photons, the horizontal scanning circuit 14 sequentially reads out the contents in the counters 10A 10N. Upon completion of reading out the pulse signals, the reset input is applied to the resent terminal 5 so that the counters 10A 10N are reset to zero. Thereafter, the same operations are repeated so that an illumination on the light receiving surface 9 is directly converted into a digital signals for each picture element and the digital signals are delivered to a succeeding stage. Fig. 5 shows schematically a second embodiment of the present invention. The line sensors with the arrangement described above with reference to Fig. 3A are integrally formed on a wafer as thin semiconductor devices 15 having a thickness of about 10 µm. A plurality of the semiconductor devices 15 are stacked on a substrate 17 and adhered to each other with adhesive such as electrically insulating organic adhesive to provide a sensor for pick up a two dimensional object. Reference numeral 16 denotes a vertical scanning circuit 16 which sequentially designates the horizontal scanning circuits 14 on the respective semiconductor devices 15. As described above, the photodiodes 8A are arranged in the form of a matrix array on the two dimensional light receiving surface 9 and the semiconductor devices 15 are stacked while electrically isolated from each other, so that a two dimensional scanning can be carried out in a usual manner. In the second embodiment, the counters 10A for counting the number of incident photons are arranged in a three dimensional manner, so that not only the horizontal and vertical scanning circuits 14 and 16 but also other necessary signal processing circuits can be disposed adjacent to the counters 10A, for instance, in the space on the righthand side in Fig. 5. This arrangement is very advantageous when the signal processing circuits must be provided for respective picture elements. Fig. 6 is a block diagram showing a third embodiment of the present invention which is very useful especially when the number of pulses corresponding to the number of photons incident to the respective photosensors cannot be obtained because a large number of photons are incident at one time. Here, reference numeral 18 denotes an avalanche photodiode 20, a wide band amplifier and 22, a differentiating circuit. Reference numeral 24 denotes a level detector which detects a level component in excess of a predetermined level of the output signal from the amplifier 20 and transmits the level component to an A D converter 26. Reference numeral 28 denotes a pulse counter for counting pulses S So far, the third embodiment has been described with respect to one picture element. Therefore, the photodiodes 18 can be arranged in one row as shown in Fig. 3A or in a two dimension fashion as shown in Fig. 5 so that various photosensors can be provided. Fig. 7 illustrates signal waveforms used to explain the mode of operation of the third embodiment shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 7 shows the output signal derived from the wide band amplifier 20 the output signal S As is apparent from Fig. 7, the number of incident photon is one at instants t1 t4 and the output pulses S So far, the third embodiment has been described in conjunction with the photons incident to one picture element, but it is to be understood that in response to the photons incident to other picture elements not shown similar operations are carried out. Fig. 8 is a block diagram showing a fourth embodiment of the present invention. In Fig. 8, reference numeral 30 represents a light receiving unit including an avalanche photodiode 32 and a wide band amplifier 20. Reference numeral 34 denotes a time to pulse number converter for converting a time interval during which the output signal derived from the amplifier 20 is in excess of a predetermined level Eo into the number of pulses corresponding to the number of incident photons corresponding to the time interval. Reference numeral 36 denotes an N bit pulse counter for counting the output pulses from the converter 34. Next, the mode of operation of the fourth embodiment shown in Fig. 8 will be described in detail with further reference to Figs. 9 and 10. Fig. 9 shows a detailed circuit corresponding to the fourth embodiment shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 10 illustrates signal waveforms used to explain the mode of operation of the fourth embodiment shown in Fig. 8. In response to the photons incident to the light receiving unit 30, a photo multiplied output is derived from the avalanche diode 32. The light receiving unit 30 is so designed and constructed as to satisfy the following conditions The time to pulse number converter 34 can be arranged as shown in Fig. 9 and can comprise a self excited circuit such as a monostable multivibrator 34 1 which generates a pulse at a time interval to slightly longer than the above described time interval t As described above, when the photons strike the light receiving unit 30 separately in a scattered manner, each photon is counted, and when a large number of photons are incident simultaneously, the number of incident photons is converted into an analog value that is, an interval of time, so that the number of pulses corresponding to the time interval is counted. As a result, the number of photons can be always counted correctly. It is preferable to set the above described time interval t It has been reported that the limit of a contrast ratio of an image displayed by a cathode ray tube CRT is 20 1 and can be attained satisfactorily by a video signal with 8 bits in terms of a binary number that is, with tones of 2⁸. Therefore, various characteristics can be obtained in accordance with various manners how an output of 2²³ tones obtained from the digital solid state image sensor in accordance with the present invention corresponds to a video signal. Fig. 11 shows an example of a circuit for obtaining a video signal with a desired tone from the digital signal output of solid state image sensor. In Fig. 11, 23 bit outputs from the digital solid state image sensor are applied through a terminal 101 having 23 ports to respective vertical lines 103 of a switch matrix 102. Respective horizontal lines 104 of the switch matrix 102 are connected to corresponding ones of 8 ports of an output terminal 105 from which a video signal is obtained. In the switch matrix 102, switches 106 are disposed at respective intersections between the vertical and horizontal lines 103 and 104 and a desired switch 106 is closed in accordance with various characteristics to be described below to determine correspondence between tones of a digital signal output of solid state image sensor and tones of a video signal. For the sake of explanation, suffixes representative of intersections between the vertical and horizontal lines 103 and 104 are affixed to the switches 106. Next, examples of the signal level conversion will be described. Like the cases described above, corresponding bits can be varied in response to an amount of incident light without changing the compression ratio. The examples as shown in Figs. 15 and 16 can express an image with a wider range of light amount than the range obtained by the examples shown in Figs. 13 and 14. Next, as to a method of signal conversion, the following methods may be considered. In one method, as shown in Fig. 17, 10 11 bits of a 23 bit output from a digital solid state image sensor 110 are directly converted into an 8 bit video signal by a converter 111. In another method, as shown in Fig. 18, 10 11 bits of the 23 bit outputs from the digital solid state image sensor 110 are applied to a switch matrix 112 which is substantially similar in construction to that described above in item 2 and a 10 11 bit video signal is derived from the switch matrix 112 and then compressed into an 8 bit video signal by a modulator 113 The above described example in item 2 will be described in more detail with specified values. In general, one lumen lm of white light contains about 10¹⁶ photons per second. One lux is defined to be equal to the illumination of a surface of 1 square meter in area against which these photons impinge. When it is assumed that one picture element of a photosensor has an area of 10 x 10 µm², about 10⁶ photons per second arrive at the area of 100 µm² at one lux. Then within 1 30 second, about 3.3 x 10⁴ photons arrive at the picture element and in order to count them, a 16 bit counter is required. When the 16 th bit of a counted value is made to correspond to the level of 100 tone of a video signal, the video signal with 100 tone can be obtained at surface illumination of 1 lux See Fig. 13 . When an amount of incident light is decreased, the 100 level of the video signal is made to correspond to the 15 th bit of the digital signal output of solid state image sensor, so that the sensitivity can be increased twice as high. On the other hand, when an amount of light is too large, the 100 level of the video signal is made to correspond to the 17 th bit of the digital signal output of solid state image sensor, so that the sensitivity can be reduce to one half 1 2 . In this manner, a sensitivity to incident light can be varied depending upon which bit of the digital signal output of solid state image sensor being made to correspond to the 100 level of the video signal. As is apparent from the above, the present invention can attain the following advantageous effects Specific data such as an amount of incident light, the number of incident photons, the number of bits in a counter and so on are shown in Table 1. The above data are obtained on the assumption that one lumen of white light contains about 10¹⁶ photons. The light receiving surface of each picture element is 10 x 10 µm². As is apparent from Table 1, the light sensitivity can be varied over a wide range simply by changing the order of bits used, so that an image of an object can be picked up under lighting conditions from sun light to moon light, without deterioration of images due to the image sensor.
