# CARDIAC PACEMAKER

## Abstract
A cardiac pacemaker of the type responsive to heart activ ity to affect the operation of the pacemaker e.g. a demand pacemaker includes a circuit for sensing heart activity which is substantially equally responsive to electrical heart activity signals of either polarity. A differential input differential output preamplifier 20 is connected to sensing terminals 36, 37 and supplies two equal and opposite signals to an absolute value circuit 21 which produces a single polarity output rep resentative of signals of either polarity at terminals 36,37. Circuit 21 may comprise two emitter followers with common base and emitter connections. In an alternative embodiment an input signal is passed through an inverting amplifier to produce an equal and oppo site signal and the two signals are again applied to an absolute value circuit. A reversion circuit 22 detects heart activity to produce a sense output, e.g. to digital pacemaker circuitry. The reduced polarity disparity enables the reversion circuit sen sitivity to be easily controlled.
