# LAUNCHABLE PYROTECHNIC CHARGE WITH ELECTRIC FUSE

## Abstract
An electric fired pyrotechnic grenade, e.g. for the generation of a smoke screen, comprising propellant and disperser charges ignitable by an electric squib. In the inoperative state the squib terminals are short circuited whereby any unintentional firing by stray currents is pre vented. Preferably a Faraday Cage is provided to shield off the squib against radio frequency interference. It is further preferred to pack the disperser charge within an axial, perforated tube.
