# Differential drive mechanism.

## Abstract
A differential drive mechanism 10 includes a driving member 12 and a driven member 16 . A planetary gearset 64 drivingly connects the driving member 12 and driven member 16 to drive the driven member 16 at a speed lower than that of the driven member 12 when the electromagnetic actuator 46 is energized. When the electro magnetic actuator 46 is not energized, a clutching member 22 engages the driven member 16 to cause the latter to be driven at the same speed as that of the driving member 12 .
