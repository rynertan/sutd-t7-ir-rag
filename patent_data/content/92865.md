# Method and device for making seals in tubular web provided with side gussets.

## Abstract
A method of making seals in tubular web provided with side gussets in which method, after making the seals, sensors for the inner gusset edges are withdrawn outwardly over a certain distance, to position of the sealing devices remaining unchanged, and after transport of the tubular the sensors are moved inwardly again and the new position of the inner gusset edges is observed. Subsequently, when a difference is observed as compared with the previous time, the position of the sealing devices is brought into corres pondence with this observation before making the next seal. A device for making seals in tubular web provided with side gussets, comprising guide members 14, 15 and gusset sealing devices 2, 3 4, 5 which are movable independently of one another in lateral direction, and in that individual means 10 13, 18 21 are provided to bring the position of the gusset sealing devices in correspondence with the position of the guide members in case the latter, after making a seal and displacing the material one or more unit bag lengths, observe a difference as compared with the previous time.
