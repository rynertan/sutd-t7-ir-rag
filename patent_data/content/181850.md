# Composite fluid separation membranes.

## Abstract
Membranes which have a non porous intermediate layer 8 between a separating layer 2 and a porous support 4 are taught wherein the in situ formed non porous intermedi ate layer 8 positioned between a porous support 4 and an in situ formed separating layer 2 , results in composite fluid separation membranes having improved permeability for the separation of fluids. The highly permeable intermediate layer 8 provides spacing between the separating layer 2 and the porous support 4 which creates a funnel effect 12, 14 for the fluid from the separating layer 2 to the pores 6 of the porous substrate 4 .

## Description
COMPOSITE FLUID SEPARATION MEMBRANES This invention relates to composite fluid separation membranes which have a non porous intermediate layer between the separating layer and the porous support. PRIOR ART Klass, et al, U.S. Patent No. 3,616,607,Stancell, et al., U.S. Patent No. 3,657,113 andYasuda, U.S. Patent No. 3,775,308 exemplify gas separation membranes having superimposed membranes on a porous support. A technique has also been developed of casting very thin polymer films on water, then to be picked up on porous supports. Since the films are very hard to handle, multiple applications have to be made and the technique is very hard to scale up. Such composite membranes for gas separations have not been without other problems. For instance,Browall in U.S. Patent No. 3,980,456 discloses the fabrication of composite membrane films for separation of oxygen from air comprising a support of microporous polycarbonate sheet and a separately formed, i.e., preformed, superimposed ultrathin separation membrane.A preformed organopolysiloxane polycarbonate copolymer sealing material in layer form is laid over the ultrathin membrane to cover any holes in the ultrathin layer. U.S. Patent 4,230,463 discloses a multi component membrane having a porous substrate which supports a thin separating layer. In summary, it appears that composite membranes for gas separation which have a superimposed membrane to provide the selective separation have achieved only slight or modest improvement in membrane performance, and there appears to be no successful, large scale commercial application of these gas separation membranes. Moreover, the superimposed membrane, although possibly ultrathin may have significantly reduced selectivity compared to the material of the superimposed membrane due to small imperfections. BACKGROUND AND DEFINITION OF TERMS The separation factor with respect to a given pair of gases for a given membrane can be determined employing numerous techniques which provide sufficient information for calculation of permeability constants or permeabilities for each of the pair of gases. Several of the many techniques available for determining permeability constants, permeabilities, and separating factors is disclosed by Hwang, et al,Techniques of Chemistry, Volume VII, Membranes inSeparations, John Wiley Sons, 1975 herein incorporated by reference at Chapter 12, pages 296 to 322. An intrinsic separation factor as referred to herein is the separation factor for a material which has no pores for fluid flow across the material, and is the highest achievable separation factor for the material. Such a material may be referred to as being continuous or non porous. The intrinsic separation factor of a material can be approximated by measuring the separation factor of a relatively thick compact membrane of the material. However, several difficulties may exist in the determination of an intrinsic separation factor including imperfections introduced in the preparation of the compact membrane such as the presence of pores, the presence of fine particles in the compact membrane, undefined molecular order due to variations in membrane preparation, and the like.Consequently, the determined intrinsic separation factor can, because of pores or other defects in the membrane, be lower than the intrinsic separation factor. Accordingly, the determined intrinsic separation factor as employed herein refers to the measured separation factor of a dry, relatively thick compact membrane of the material. A useful characteristic with respect to gas or fluid separations composite membranes is the effective pore size of the porous support, especially where the permeability of the material of the porous support is poor. If the separating layer is applied directly onto the surface of a porous support the effective area of the separating layer, with respect to a given pore in the substrate, is the same as the cross sectional area of the pore. In this invention, a layer of material having a high permeability is interposed between the porous support and the separating layer. This interposed layer causes gas to pass through the layer along a funnel shaped path, with the pore in the substrate corresponding to the neck of the funnel and the effective area of the separating layer corresponding to the open upper end of the funnel.Since the surface area of a cylindrical fiber is a function of the square of the fiber radius, the effective cross sectional area of the pore is a function of the square of the thickness of the highly permeable interposed layer. This effectively magnifies the effective size of the pore and is referred to herein as the funnel effect . BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION The composite fluid separation membrane in accordance with this invention with respect to at least one gas provides a permeability which is improved through the use of a non porous intermediate layer comprised of a polymer material which is extremely permeable to gases, and of low selectivity.Interposing such a thin intermediate layer of such a polymer between the porous support and the thin, dense selective layer has a number of beneficial effects such as allowing the thin separating layer to withstand reasonable differential pressure. For such a thin separating layer to withstand differential pressures without the intermediate layer, the separating layer s thickness must be at least equal to the pore diameter of the porous support. The intermediate layer is non porous, thus, in effect creates an essentially non porous support combination for the separating layer. While this membrane may be used for separating fluids which are liquids or gases, its preferred use is in separating one gas from a mixture of gases. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Generally, organic polymers or organic polymers mixed with inorganics are used to prepare the separating layer of this invention Typical polymers suitable for the separation membrane according to the invention can be substituted or unsubstituted crosslinked or uncross linked polymers and may be selected from polysulfones, poly styrenes , including styrenecontaining copolymers such as acrylonitrilestyrene copolymers, styrene butadiene copolymers and styrenevinyl benzylhalide copolymers polycarbonates cellulosic polymers, such as cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose propionate, ethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose, nitrocellulose, etc. polyamides and polyimides, including aryl polyamides and aryl polyimides polyethers poly arylene oxides such as poly phenylene oxide , substituted poly phenylene oxides and poly xylene oxide poly esteramide diisocyanate polyurethanes polyesters including polyarylates , such as poly ethylene terephthalate , poly alkyl methacrylates , poly acrylates , poly phenylene terephthalate , etc. polysulfides, polymers from monomers having alpha olefinic unsaturation other than mentioned above such as poly ethylene , poly propylene , poly butene l , poly 4 methyl pentene l , polyvinyls, e.g., poly vinyl chloride , poly vinyl fluoride , poly vinylidene chloride , poly vinylidene fluoride , poly vinyl alcohol , poly vinyl esters such as poly vinyl acetate and poly vinyl propionate , poly vinyl pyridines , poly vinyl pyrrolidones , poly vinyl ethers , poly vinyl ketones , poly vinyl aldehydes such as poly vinyl formal and poly vinyl butyral , poly vinyl amides , poly vinyl amines , poly vinyl urethanes , poly vinyl ureas , poly vinyl phosphates and poly vinyl sulfates poly vinyl silanes polyalkyls poly benzobenzimidazole polyhydrazides polyoxadiazoles, polytriazoles, poly benzimidazole polycarbodiimides etc., and interpolymers, including block interpolymers containing repeating units from the above such as interpolymers of acrylonitrile vinyl bromide sodium salt of para sulfophenylmethallyl ethers and grafts and blends containing any of the foregoing.

The solution containing the polymeric material which forms the separating layer must be of a nature which will sufficiently wet the intermediate non porous layer in order to provide suitable contact with the in situ formed separating layer to the intermediate layer. Suitable solvents for the solution containing the polymeric material which forms the separating layer include its solvents which have sufficient solubility to form coating solutions of the polymeric materials of the separating layer. These solvents can be selected from normally liquid alkanes, alcohols, ketones, some substituted alkane, alcohols, ketones and the like and mixtures thereof. Optionally, the composite membrane consisting of a porous substrate, intermediate layer and separating layer, can be insitu coated with one or more additional layers of a highly permeable, nonselective polymer to further improve selectivity. The additional layer can be of a material identical to or different from that of the intermediate layer. The selectivity and permeability relationships of the additional coating to those of the separating layer are the same as those of the intermediate layer. The thickness of the composite membrane will be within the range of 200 x 10 10 to 15,000 x 10 10 meters. For a better understanding of the invention of the improved composite gas separation membrane, reference is made to Figures 3, 4 and 6 which are in accordance with the invention and comparative Figures of 1, 2 and 5 which are in accordance with the prior art. Prior art Figure 1 illustrates a typical composite separation membrane wherein a separating layer 2 is in contact with a porous support 4 having continuous pores 6. Figure 2 is an expanded view of a segment of Figure 1 more clearly illustrating the relationship of a thin separating layer coating in contact with the porous support 4. The composite gas separation membrane in accordance with the invention is illustrated by Figure 2 wherein the intermediate non porous layer 8 is shown in position between the separating layer 2 and porous support 4.In addition defects 10 of the dense separating layer 2 are also indicated said defects extending through the coating of the separating layer. The defects are effectively sealed by the intermediate layer. Figure 4 is an enlarged segment of the improved composite gas separation membrane of Figure 2 wherein the effective pore size 12 is illustrated relative to the actual pore opening of pore 6. The spacing allowed by the intermediate layer 8 allows the gas being separated by separating layer 2 to funnel or more freely transmit to the pore 6 for flow through the membrane thus, the effective pore size dimension 12 which is substantially larger than the actual pore size 14. RegardingFigure 2 of the prior art representation, the gas would substantially be transmitted through actual pore size opening and not have the benefit of the funneling effect. Figure 5 is a further expanded view of a segment of Figure 2 more clearly illustrating the relationship of a thin separating layer coating in contact with the porous support 4 and gas flow route 15 and 19 in order to reach pore 6. The gas molecule must travel the distance of route 19 through the highly selective, but low permeable material of the separating layer. When comparing the gas flow routes 15 and 19 of Figure 5 to routes 15 and 20 of Figure 6, the funnel effect or enlarged effective pore size can be realized. Assuming, for example, in comparingFigures 5 and 6 a permeability rate for coating 2 of 2 and a rate of 10 for intermediate layer 8, an intermediate layer thickness 18 of 1 and a length for route 19 of 3.The P 2 for the separating element of the separating layer 2 in Figure 5 would be 2 3 0.67 as compared to the P Q for the separating element of the separating layer 2 in Figure 6 of 10 3.16 3.16.These figures are for comparative use however, such figures could be based on true comparative units. Preferred polymers for the intermediate layer are silicones, polyfluorophosphazenes, poly vinyl silanes , and polysilylacetylenes. Preferred examples of porous substrates are porous polypropylene, porous glass, porous polysulfone and the like. Preferred examples of separating polymers are cellulose acetate, polysulfone, polyethersulfone, polyimides and polyphenylene oxide and its derivatives. The important factors in applying the in situ formed intermediate non porous layer and the in situ formed separating layer involve good wetting technique, hence low interfacial surface tension of, for example, the porous support by the intermediate polymer solution and of the intermediate non porous layer by the separating layer polymer solution. A separation factor a b , a, for a membrane for a given pair of gases a and b is defined as the ratio of the permeability constant Pa of the membrane for gas a to the permeability constant Pb of the membrane for gas b. A separation factor, alpha, is also equal to the ratio of the reduced permeability, P 2 pea of a membrane of thickness l for gas a of a gas mixture to the reduced permeability of the same membrane to gas b, Pb B , wherein the permeability for a given gas is the volume of gas at standard temperature and pressure STP , which passes through a membrane per square centimeter of surface area, per second, for a partial pressure drop of 1 centimeter of mercury across the membrane per unit of thickness, and is expressed as P cm3 cm cm2 sec cmHg. EXAMPLES The following table illustrates twenty examples, fifteen of which are in accordance with the invention. Examples 2, 4, 12, 16 and 18 are for purposes of comparison and are not in accordance with the invention. The membranes of examples 2, 4, 12, 16 and 18 do not include an intermediate non porous layer while the remaining thirteen examples illustrate various intermediate non porous layers and the functionality of same as gas separators for C02 methane and oxygen nitrogen. In addition, various separating layers of polymeric materials are used in combination with the various intermediate layers. As can be seen from the examples, Examples 2, 4, 12 and 18 have separation factors for carbon dioxide methane of about 1 indicating that little or no selectivity was achieved due to imperfections in the dense separating layer. Example 16 has a separation factor for carbon dioxide methane of 8 indicating that the separating layer of polyphenylene oxide has fewer defects than the separating layers of examples 2, 4, 12 and 18, however, permeability is quite low. The intermediate layer combination of Examples 17 and 19, both achieved substantial increases in permeability and separation factors over the results of comparativeExamples 16 and 18. The same separating layer, that is a separating layer produced in the same manner as in Example 2, was utilized in Example 1 in combination with the intermediate non porous layer illustrating for the same separating layer and substrate, a separation factor for carbon dioxide methane of 19. The polyethersulfone separating layer of Example 3 in combination with the intermediate layer provides a separation factor for carbon dioxide methane of 15 to 16 while the same separating layer on the same porous substrate without the intermediate layer has a separation factor of 1, i.e., no separation. Example 14 illustrates an additional aspect of the inventive composite membrane wherein an additional top coating over the separating layer is applied with the resulting composite membrane having very desirable C02 methane separation factor of 40 and a P for CO2 of 46. Example 15 illustrates the use of a composite membrane according to the invention wherein composite membrane has a separation factor for oxygen nitrogen of 3.5 and a P Q for oxygen of 30. The composite membranes of Examples 1, 3, 5 through 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19 and 20 were prepared in the following manner. A porous support membrane in the form of a porous polypropylene in sheet form was impregnated with toluene to completely fill the pores. Before the toluene evaporated the impregnated membrane was covered with a 2 by weight solution of poly trimethylsilyl propyne in cyclohexane. Excess solution was drained from the membrane and all solvents were allowed to evaporate. The membrane thus coated with the poly trimethylsilyl propyne was dried at room temperature to about 400 C. in a vacuum oven. The membrane was then coated with a separating layer in essentially the same manner. The membrane was then coated with a 0.5 to 2 solution of separating polymer in a solvent which is a non solvent for both the porous support and the intermediate layer such as dichloroethane. Excess solution was drained and the solvent evaporated to yield the finished composite membrane. Performance testing of the membranes as illustrated in the table, examples 1 through 20 was conducted in a standard test cell wherein the membrane is clamped into position with one side of the membrane at vacuum 5 25 Pascals 30 200 pEg and the other side under pressure of the test gas mixture of approximately 66,600 to 200,000 Pascals 50 150 centimeters mercury. The feed composition for the standard test cell is comprised of air for Example 20 and an approximate ratio of 25 75 by volume of CO2 and CH4 forExamples 1 19. After an equilibrium period the permeability was determined by following the pressure rise on the low pressure side of the membrane as a function of time. Selectivity was calculated by determining the composition of the permeated gas and comparing same to the feed gas composition.In Example 10, PES is polyether sulfone.
