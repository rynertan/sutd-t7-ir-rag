# Multi channel magnetic transducer head and method of manufacturing same.

## Abstract
A multi channel magnetic transducer head comprises a magnetic substrate 1 , and a plurality of thin film type magnetic transducer head elements arranged on the magne tic substrate, each magnetic transducer head element includ ing a coil conductor 3 disposed on the magnetic substrate and a thin film magnetic core 4 to constitute a magnetic circuit in co operation with the substrate, wherein a non magnetic gap spacer layer 7 of a predetermined thickness and a width corresponding to the track width is formed below the front edge of the thin film magnetic core on the magnetic core. A non magnetic layer 2,5 of a thickness larger than that of the gap spacer layer 7 forms a track spacing portion. The thin film magnetic core has width covering at least the gap spacer layer 7 whereby good magnetic recording can be performed.
