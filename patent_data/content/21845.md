# An electrostatic image forming process and an apparatus therefor.

## Abstract
The invention relates to the field of color electrophotography. In order to form electrostatically an image of an original having black and color portions a method and apparatus involve applying to a first photoconductive surface 12 an electrostatic charge corresponding to black areas and developing them with toner. Then, to form an electrostatic charge corresponding to color areas on the first surface for separate development, the first surface 12 is charged in areas corresponding to black and color areas, and a second photoconductive surface 13 is charged in areas corresponding only to black areas. The two surfaces 12, 13 are brought adjacent one another, and the part of the charge on the first surface 12 corresponding to black areas is eliminated either due to the second surface 13 charge being of opposite polarity, or by the second surface 13 charge being on a screen which is used to control charged particle flow onto the first surface 13 .
