# HIGH EFFICIENCY ALTERNATING ENDOTHERMIC ENGINE WITH A NEW THERMODYNAMIC CYCLE

## Abstract
Alternating endothermic engine with a new ther modynamic cycle in which the combustion chamber volume is kept constant for the period required for complete combustion of the operating fluid. In this way, higher maximum pressure is achieved for a pre established and calculable period so as to obtain a more elevated tangential component and thus a higher engine torque for the same heat absorption and fuel consumption as in current engines. At the same time dangerous emissions are sharply reduced, while internal cooling is effected with reduced heat loss and energy savings.
