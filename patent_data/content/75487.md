# MARINE STRUCTURE

## Abstract
An internally stabilized earth wall is disclosed along with facing elements 24, 30 suitable for construction of that wall in a wet marine environment. The wall elements include footer panels 30 and wall panels 24 , each of which is provided with a pivotally attached planar array of reinforcing members 44 . The reinforcing members are hingedly mounted so as to be lowered in a vertical plane to a substantially horizontal posture on top of a lift of particulate material. According to the method, the footer panels 30 are suspended and properly positioned by a stationary crane while crushed stone 40 is dumped into position beneath the footer so as to support it. With the footer in position, the wall is erected by guiding each wall panel 24 of a course into position on top of the associated footer panel 30 and backfilling the wall panel by depositing a layer of particulate material subsequently lowering at least one array of rein forcing members 44 and repeating those steps until tne last layer of reinforcing members has been positioned on top of a lift of particulate material. When the top of the wall has attained the appropriate elevation above the water sur face, a cap member 76 is integrally cast in place.
