# Molding composition and method for producing a molded article.

## Abstract
A molded article simulating the appearance of natural plantation crepe rubber and a method for producing this article. Styrene butadiene linear or radial block copolymer having a polymerized styrene content of the range of about 20 to about 50 weight percent of the total block copolymer and resinous polymer of vinylsubstituted aromatic com pound in the range of about 10 to about 60 parts resinous polymer per 100 parts block copolymer are blended with a sufficient amount of polarizing agent to achieve rapid heat ing through response to microwave treatment. The compo sition is melted, molded against a surface mirroring the ap pearance of plantation crepe rubber, and removed from the mold as an article simulating plantation crepe rubber. In an embodiment of the invention with chemical blowing agent incorporated into the molding composition, an amount of the molding composition is introduced with the mold that upon activation of the blowing agent during the molding operation produces a molded article having a nor mally dense skin with a microporous interior.
