# METHOD FOR PRODUCING L SORBOSE

## Abstract
In a method for producing L sorbose by microbial oxidation of D sorbitol, a competent microorganism is cultivated in a medium in which the concentration of dissolved oxygen is controlled in the range of about 1 to about 4 ppm throughout the growth phase of said microor ganism. Thus, L sorbose can be produced in much greater yield, compared with known methods.
