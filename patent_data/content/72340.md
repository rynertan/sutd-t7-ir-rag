# Separation of two liquids.

## Abstract
A device for separating two liquids one of which is heavier than the other. The device comprises a main chamber 120 in which there is a float 128 . The float is such that it sinks in the lighter of the liquids and floats in the heavier. A control chamber 140 having a fixed wall part 142 and a movable wall part 144 is provided. The movable wall part is subjected to the pressure existing in the main chamber which pressure urges the movable wall part in the direction which reduces the volume of the control chamber. A restricted inlet 146 places the control chamber and main chamber in communication. There is an outlet 158 from the control chamber which is normally closed by a valve 168 . The valve is opened, mechanically or electrically, when the float rises upon heavier liquid accumulating in the main chamber. A valve seat 160 surrounds an outlet 156 from the main chamber. Said movable wall part engages said seat to close the main outlet until movement of the movable wall part occurs upon said valve 168 being opened. The valve operating member 170 and the float are each provided with engagement surfaces 172, 174, 176, 178 . Upon the float rising due to the accumula tion of the heavier liquid in the chamber, the surface on the rotating float engages the surface on the valve operating member so that a chattering action is exterted on the valve operating member.
