# Automatic identification of cuff size in automated blood pressure monitors.

## Abstract
Automated blood pressure monitors utilizing a pressurized cuff are adapted automatically to work with a variety of cuff sizes, including neonatal. An acoustical pressure pulse is gen erated at the monitor, propagated to and through the cuff, and back to a pressure transducer in the monitor. The total time of propagation is indicative of the cuff size being utilized.
