# Clamp arrangements.

## Abstract
An assembly comprising a board 1 and a mechanism 17 for clamping a marginal portion of the board adjacent an edge between two opposed substantially flat parallel walls 7a . The mechanism 17 is mounted on a major surface of the board 1 and includes a spring strip 21 extending longitudinally along the mechanism, and having corruga tions transverse to its length. An elongate cam 27 extends along the length of the strip 21 , overlying the strip, and being supported for rotation about its longitudinal axis. Rotation of the cam 27 causes expansion of the mechanism 17 in a direction normal to the surface, limitation of the expansion by the walls 7a leading to compression of the corrugations in the strip 21 .
