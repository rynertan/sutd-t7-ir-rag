## Description
Brief Summary of the InventionTechnical Field This invention is directed in general to pressure sensitive and heat activated adhesive coating compositions and, in particular, to photocopolymerizable compositions comprising a poly active hydrogen organic compound, a photoinitiator and, as a reactive diluent, a substituted cycloaliphatic monoepoxide.Background Art Governmental regulations have placed ever increasing restrictions on the amounts and types of organic volatiles permitted to escape into the atmosphere from coatings compositions. Considerable efforts have been expended to develop coatings compositions having a minimal amount of volatile organic components and this has led to development of radiation curable coatings, powder coatings, water borne coatings and high solids coatings In these recent developments the amounts of organic solvents present are minimal and consequently there is little or no atmospheric pollution. In the field of radiation curable coatings, it is well known that coating compositions containing cycloaliphatic epoxides and hydroxyl containing materials can be radiation cured by the use of onium salts such as FC 508 available from the 3M Company and UVE 1014 available from General Electric Company. The onium salts form shelf stable formulations with cycloaliphatic epoxides and hydroxyl containing materials in an environment free of ultraviolet light radiation.When such onium salts are irradiated with ultraviolet light, a cationic catalyst composition is formed that cures the formulation into a coating film with little or no organic volatiles escaping into the atmosphere. However, the cycloaliphatic epoxides used in the radiation curable coatings have a relatively high viscosity of about 300 to 500 centipoise or more. In addition, hydroxyl containing materials such as organic polyols are oftentimes blended withy the cycloaliphatic epoxide to improve certain coating properties such as flexibility and toughness of the coating. When the organic polyols are of sufficient molecular weight to improve flexibility of the cured coatings, the viscosity of the blended formulations is oftentimes increased even further.The high viscosity of the blended formulations precludes the application thereof to a suitable substrate by conventional techniques such as roll coating, spray and other methods of application.Solvents in general can be used to reduce the viscosity of the curable blended formulations.However, the solvents must be volatilized at some point in the curing process and such volatilization will negate the atmospheric pollution control benefits of radiation curable coatings which are considered to be essentially 100 percent solids coating systems. Thus, radiation curable coatings such as the ones hereinafter described which exhibit desirably low viscosity and produce good satisfactory cured coating films, are of great importance. It has been found as a result of the present invention that certain substituted cycloaliphatic monoepoxides can be used as reactive diluents in photocopolymerizable coating compositions based on hydroxyl containing organic materials to produce curable coating formulations having desirable low viscosity. Such curable coating formulations require little or no organic solvent to improve flowability during application thereof by conventional methods to a suitable surface or substrate. The cured coating films prepared from these low viscosity photocopolymerizable coating formulations also exhibit highly desirable adhesive film properties as described more fully hereinbelow.Disclosure of the Invention The present invention is directed to photocopolymerizable compositions comprising a poly active hydrogen organic compound, a photoinitiator and, as a reactive diluent, a substituted cycloaliphatic monoepoxide. The invention is also directed to blend compositions comprising a poly active hydrogen organic compound and a vinyl cycloaliphatic monoepoxide. The above compositions can optionally contain a surfactant, filler, additives and an organic solvent where necessary. The photocopolymerizable compositions have desirably low viscosity and can be applied in a conventional manner such as roll coating, spray and the like and, after exposure to any source of radiation emitting actinic radiation at a wavelength within the ultraviolet and visible spectral regions, can be cured to pressure sensitive and heat activated adhesive coating films.The cured adhesive coating films have general utility in most adhesive applications. The photocopolymerizable compositions can also be used in a variety of applications in the field of graphic arts including printing Inks and the like. The invention is further directed to process for preparing a cured film coating comprising i mixing until homogeneous a photocopolymerizable composition comprising a poly active hydrogen organic compound, a substituted cycloaliphatic monoepoxide and a photoinitiator 2 apprying the homogeneous photocopolymerizable composition as a film coating on a suitable surface or substrate and 3 exposing the film coating to actinic irradiation at a wavelength within the ultra violet and visible spectral regions or electron beam irradiation for a period of time sufficient to cure the film coating.The cured film coating prepared by the above described process is also a part of this invention.The cured adhesive film coating is yet another part of this invention.

Preferred photoinitiators alone or in admixture include triarylsulfonium complex salts as described in U.S.Patent 4,231,951, aromatic sulfonium or iodonium salts of halogen containing complex ions as described in U.S. Patent 4,256,828 aromatic onium salts cf Group VIa elements as described in U.S.Patents 4,058,401 and 4,138,255 aromatic onium salts of Group Va elements as described in U.S.Patent 4,069,055. Such salts are commercially available as FC 508 and FC 509 available fromMinnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company , and asUVE 1014 available from General Electric Company .Other preferred photoinitiators for use in the coating compositions of this invention are described more fully in copending U.S. Patent ApplicationSerial No. D 13814 , filed on an even date herewith. The photoinitiators are used in conventional amounts such as from about 0.1 to 30 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the combination of vinyl cycloaliphatic monoepoxide and the poly active hydrogen organic compound. The adhesive coating compositions may preferably include additives in conventional quantities such as oils, particularly silicone oil, surfactants such as silicone alkylene oxide copolymers, e.g., L 5410 commercially available fromUnion Carbide Corporation, silicone oil containing aliphatic epoxide groups, fluorocarbon surfactants such as FC 171 commercially available from the 3MCompany and FC 430 also commercially available from the 3M Company low molecular weight alcohols such as RJ 100 commercially available from MonsantoChemical Company cellosolves, such as butylCELLOSOLVE commercially available from Union CarbideCorporation carbitols, such as butyl CARBITOL diethyleneglycol low molecular weight hydroxyl containing vinyl polymers such as UCARSolution Vinyl VYES commercially available fromUnion Carbide Corporation glycidyl ether monomers of the formula EMI23.1 wherein R11 is alkyl or aryl and n is an integer of 1 to 6. Examples are glycidyl ethers of polyhydric phenols obtained by reacting a polyhydric phenol with an excess of chlorohydrin such as epichlorohydrin. Further examples of this type are described in, for example, U.S. Patent 3,018,262 alpha olefin epoxides epoxy novolaks, and the like. If desired, one may also include in the adhesive coating compositions various conventional non basic fillers e.g., silica, talc, glass beads or bubbles, clays, powdered metal such as aluminum, zinc oxide, etc. up to about 50 by volume or more, viscosity modifiers, rubbers, tackifying agents, pigments, and so forth. The particular additives or fillers selected are of no consequence to the basic invention. The photocopolymerizable coating compositions of this invention may optionally include an epoxide containing two or more epoxy groups. The use of epoxides containing two or more epoxy groups in photocopolymerizable compositions based on epoxy and hydroxyl containing organic materials is more fully described in copending U.S.Patent Application Serial No. D 13813 , filed on an even date herewith. In preparing the coating compositions, the ingredients are mixed by conventional procedures used in the production of inks, paints and coating compositions. These procedures are so well known to those illed in the art that they do not require further discussion here. However, it should be noted that when the photoinitiator is incorporated into the coating compositions, it is necessary that the curable coating formulation be mixed or blended under wsafe light such as a yellow light source to obviate or minimize photocopolymerization. The coating composit ions can also contain an organic solvent as an optional component. Any of the conventional solvents used in the coatings industry can be used at a concentration preferably below 30 weight percent of the total weight of the coating composition.Suitable solvents are acetone, methylene chloride and any solvent that does not react appreciably with the substituted cycloaliphatic monoepoxide, the epoxide containing two or more epoxy groups and the photoinitiator.While larger amounts of solvent could conceivably be used, the use of larger amounts would negate the benefits of radiation curable coating which are considered to be essentially 100 percent solids coating systems. The solvents are generally added in the small amounts indicated to improve flowability during application of the coating composition to the substrate. The curable coating compositions of this invention are applied to a suitable surface or substrate by conventional means such as roll coating or spray. Curing or photocopolymerization of the coating compositions occurs on exposure of the compositions to any source of radiation emitting actinic radiation at a wavelength within the ultraviolet and visible spectral regions. Suitable sources of radiation include mercury, xenon, carbon arc and tungsten filament lamps, sunlight, etc.Exposures may be from less than about 1 second to 10 minutes or more depending upon the amounts of particular polymerizable materials and photoinitiators being utilized and depending upon the radiation source and distance from the source and the thickness of the coating to be cured. The compositions may also be polymerized by exposure to electron beam irradiation. Generally speaking the dosage necessary is from less than 1 megarad to 100 megarad or more. Generally speaking the rate of polymerization increases with increasing amounts of photoinitiator at a given light exposure or irradiation. The rate of polymerization also increases with increasing light intensity or electron dosage. The curing or photocopolymerization of the coating compositions is a triggered reaction. Once the degradation of the photoinitiator to a cat ionic catalyst has begun by exposure to a radiation source, the curing or photocopolymerization reaction proceeds and will continue after the radiation source is removed. The use of thermal energy during or after exposure to a radiation source, i.e., post cure thermally, will generally accelerate the curing reaction, and even a moderate increase in temperature may greatly accelerate cure rate. The coating compositions were evaluated according to the following procedures Solvent Resistance Double Acetone Rubs a measure of the resistance of the cured film to attack by acetone in which a film coating surface was rubbed with an acetone soaked cheesecloth back and forth with hand pressure. A rub back and forth with hand pressure over the film coating surface with the acetone soaked cheesecloth was designated as one double acetone rub . The effect that a certain number of double acetone rubs had on the film coating surface was reported by a number in parenthesis following the number of double acetone rubs. The rating system for evaluating acetone resistance for a given number of double acetone rubs was as follows Number in Parenthesis After Number of Rubs 1 No change in coating appearance. 2 Scratched surface. 3 Dulled, marred, some coating removed. Breaks in coating appearance. 5 About one half of the coating removed. Pencil Hardness pencil leads of increasing hardness values were forced against the film coating surface in a precisely defined manner as described in ASTM D 3363 74 until one pencil lead marred the surface of the film coating. The surface hardness was considered as the hardest pencil grade which just failed to mar the film coating surface.The pencil leads in order of softest to hardest were reported as follows 6B, 5B, 4B, 3B, 2B, B, HB, F,H, 2H, 3H, 4H, 5H, 6E, 7H, 8H, and 9H. Crosshatch Adhesion a lattice pattern with ten cuts in each direction was made in the coating film to the substrate and pressure sensitive adhesive tape was applied over the lattice pattern and then removed. The adhesion was evaluated by comparison with descriptions and illustrations as more fully detailed in ASTM D 3359 78. Forward Impact Resistance Gardner Impact a measure of the ability of a cured film coating to resist rupture from a falling weight. A GardnerImpact Tester Model IG 1l20 using an eight pound dart was used to test film coatings cast and cured on steel panels. The dart was raised to a given height in inches and dropped onto the coated side of the coated steel panel. The inches times pounds, designated inch pounds, absorbed by the film without rupturing was recorded as the films forward impact resistance. Reverse Impact Resistance Gardner Impact a measure of the ability of a cured film coating to resist rupture from a falling weight. A GardnerImpact Tester Model IG 1120 using an eight pound dart was used to test film coatings cast and cured on steel panels. The dart was raised to a given height in inches and dropped onto the uncoated side of the coated steel panel. The inches times pounds, designated inch pounds, absorbed by the film without rupturing was recorded as the films reverse impact resistance.Peel Adhesion a measure of the force required to remove a pressure sensitive tape from a panel or its own backing at a specified angle and speed. The tape is applied to a standard test panel, or a test panel covered with the tape under test, using definite pressure to make the contact. The force is expressed in ounces converted to pounds per inch width of tape PLI . This method designated asPSTC 1 is described more fully in Test Methods forPressure Sensitive Tapes, Seventh Edition, p. 22,Developed by the Specifications and TechnicalCommittee of the Pressure Sensitive Tape Council,Glenview, Illinois 1976 .Shear Adhesion a measure of the force required to pull the pressure sensitive tape from a standard flat surface in a direction parallel to the surface to which it has been affixed with a definite pressure. It can be measured in terms of the time required to pull a standard area of tape from a test panel under a standard load, or in terms of a distance the tape has been displaced in a given time on a test panel under a standard load. This method designated as PSTC 7 is described more fully in TestMethods for Pressure Sensitive Tapes, SeventhEdition, p. 30, Developed by the Specifications andTechnical Committee of the Pressure Sensitive TapeCouncil, Glenview, Illinois 1976 .

The blended formulations of Examples 1 through 13 were then applied to Bonderite 37 R treated steel panels using a Number 20 wire wound rod and cured with one pass under a 100 watt per inch, medium pressure, mercury lamp ultraviolet light source at 30 feet per minute. The cured coating on the Bonderite 37 R treated steel panels of Examples 14 through 18 was prepared from the blended formulations of Examples 1 through 5 respectively. The cured coating on the Bonderite 37 R treated steel panels of Examples 25 and 26 was prepared from the blended formulations ofExamples 12 and 13 respectively. The thickness of the coatings varied from about 0.8 mils to about 0.9 mils.

The cured coatings on the Bonderite 37 R treated steel panels of Examples 14 through 26 had a slight tack when warm immediately after ultraviolet light irradiation. When cooled to room temperature, the cured coatings on the Bonderite 37 R treated steel panels of Examples 14, 16, 18, 19, 21 and 23 were tack free and were therefore, suitable for use as coatings and or heat activated adhesives.When cooled to room temperature, the cured coatings on the Bonderite 37 R treated steel panels of Examples 15, 17, 20, 22, 24, 25 and 26 maintained a tack and were therefore suitable for use as pressure sensitive adhesives. Additional cured coatings on Bonderite 37 R treated steel panels were prepared as described above from the blend formulations ofExamples 12 and 13 and tested for adhesive strength. About an inch of the coated panels were contacted over their width and pressed together with thumb and forefinger pressure. The contacted panels exhibited excellent lap shear and peel strength as determined by separation of the contacted panels by hand force. In one instance, the coated Bonderite 37 R treated steel panel actually bent before the contacted bond failed in peel adhesion. The blended formulation of Example 13 was also applied to a polypropylene film commercially available from Hercules, Inc. as Pellicules FilmType T 502 using a Number 20 wire wound rod and cured with one pass under a 100 watt per inch, medium pressure, mercury lamp ultraviolet light source at 30 feet per minute. The thickness of the coating was about 0.9 mils. The blend formulation wet the surface of the polypropylene film very well and cured into a smooth adhesive coating. The resulting coating exhibited excellent adhesive characteristics as determined by pressure contact of the coated polypropylene film with a surface and separation thereof by hand force.
