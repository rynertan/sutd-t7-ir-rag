# Reaction cuvette.

## Abstract
A cup like container 3 useful as a reaction cuvette for receiving a liquid dispensing probe 17, 19 has at least one interior surface of hydrophilic material which has inwardly extending projections 31 . The cuvettes may be mounted in, or formed integrally with, a reaction tray 1 and preferably include a pair of transparent parallel opposed side walls 23, 23 to define an optical passage through the cuvette for optical analysis of its contents. The cuvette and trays are particularly useful in automatic analysis systems.
