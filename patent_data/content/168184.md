# Inertia lock type synchronous clutch mechanism.

## Abstract
An interia lock type synchronous clutch mechanism wherein a shifting sleeve 4 is splined to a clutch hub 2 and has circumferentially spaced cam portions 6 on each axial side for engaging axially convex portions 7a of an elastic ring 7 on each side which convex portions fit within circumferentially spaced notches 8 formed in the rim 2a of the clutch hub. The convex portions of the elastic ring engage a blocking ring 5 to cause frictional engagement with the selected gear and synchronize the rotation of that gear and the clutch hub for smooth engagement between the shifting sleeve and that gear.
