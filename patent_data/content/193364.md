## Abstract
This invention provides a woven tubular gasket having a continuous integral attachment means which is contained within the woven tubular members and which has protru sions which extend through or are extendable through the walls of the woven tubular member or members and are adapted to engage openings in an appropriate surface or substrate on which the gasket is to be attached. The method of this invention provides for continuously forming the combination of the attachment means and the woven tubular member. The attachment means is fed continuously into the interior of the woven tubular member as it is formed to thereby incorporate the attachment means into the interior of the woven tubular member.
