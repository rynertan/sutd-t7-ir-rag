# Process to copolymerize vinyl chloride and chlorotrifluoroethylene.

## Abstract
A process for the suspension copolymerization of vinyl chloride and chlorotrifluoroethylene to form a copolymer hav ing a constant weight ratio of vinyl chloride and chlorotri fluoroethylene independent of conversion, which consists in polymerization with an initial charge containing excess vinyl chloride and adding additional vinyl chloride prior to reaching the conversion where the copolymer composition changes.
