# POLYPEPTIDES, PROCESS FOR THEIR MICROBIAL PRODUCTION, INTERMEDIATES THEREFOR AND COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM

## Abstract
Microbially produced mature human fibroplast inter feron and means used in its production, i.e. recombinant DNA molecules coding for the amino acid sequences of fibroplast interferon, vectors capable of expressing fibro blast interferon in microbial host organisms and host organisms transformed with these vectors.
