# DEVICE FOR MEASURING IONIC ACTIVITY

## Abstract
A device is disclosed for measuring ionic activity of ions contained in solutions. The device comprises a lower support ing frame, at least one pair of ion selective electrodes, an upper supporting frame made of a thermoplastic material having at least one pair of apertures for spotting reference and sample solutions, and at least one porous bridge for effecting an elec trical conduction between both solutions. Both ends of the porous bridge are fixed on the upper supporting frame by softening or melting of the the thermoplastic material such that the porous bridge is extended over the pair of the apertures.
