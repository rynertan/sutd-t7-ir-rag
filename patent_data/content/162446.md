# Hollow fiber filter module.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a hollow fiber filter module having a novel structure in which a large number of hollow fibers 3 for filtration use are disposed in a rectilinear fashion, two exit planes 9,10 are defined by the opposite open ends of the hollow fibers 3 , a filtrate collection chamber 4 is formed over one 10 of the exit planes 9,10 , and one or more filtrate conduits 6 are provided in order to conduct the filtrate col lected in the filtrate collection chamber 4 to the other exit plane 9 . This hollow fiber filter module permits the efficient uti lization of a hollow fiber filter membrane and, therefore, can reduce the space occupied by the module. Moreover, a plu rality of such hollow fiber filter modules can be connected in series and used in the form of a hollow fiber filter module assembly having a length of several meters.
