# Magnetic key operated lock structure and key therefor.

## Abstract
The lockset includes a housing, a slidable core 18 in said housing. The core 18 is adapted to be translated from a locking position to an unlocking position by a magnetically coded key and a locking plate alongside said core. The locking plate is provided with apertures for receiving locking pins 86 therein from said core 18 . A locking pin carrier 82 carried by the core 18 slidably supports a code changing locking pin 86 therein. A tool operable from outside said housing permits to move said carrier 82 and said code changing pin 86 relative to said core 18 for changing the code of said lock structure. Usefull especially for hotel guest room doors, in order to change the magnetic code of the lockset, for example on arrival of a new guest.
