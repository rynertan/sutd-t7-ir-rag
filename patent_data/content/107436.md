# Polypeptides useful in vaccination against enteroviruses.

## Abstract
A synthetic polypeptide, suitable for use in vaccination against or diagnosis of a disease caused by an enterovirus, is an octapeptide coded for by codons 93 100 in the RNA sequence doded for the structural capsid protein VPI for poliovirus type 3 Sabin strain or by equivalent codons of another enterovirus or is an antigenic equivalent of such an octapeptide, the numbers of the codons being counted from the 5 terminus of the nucleotide sequence for the VPI capsid protein.
