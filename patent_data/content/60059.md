## Description
METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE ACTIVITY OF CHOLINESTERASE AND DIAGNOSTIC SOLUTION FOR USE THEREIN This invention relates to a method for determining the activity of cholinesterase and to a diagnostic solution for use therein. Two kinds of cholinesterase are known, these being generally referred to as true cholinesterase and pseudocholinesterase. True cholinesterase can be found in human red blood cells and nerve tissues. Pseudo cholinesterase can be found in human sera and pancreas. Cholinesterase can decompose acylcholine i.e. acetylcholine to choline and acid acetic acid . When a person is subject to hepatic diseases or anaemia, the amount of cholinesterase in the blood decreases, and when a person is subject to nephrosis, diabetes mellitus or diseases of the nervous system, the amount of cholinesterase increases. A diagnosis of the diseases mentioned above can be made by measuring the level of cholinesterase in the blood. Therefore, the accurate determination of the activity of cholinesterase contained in a serum sample is significant from both the physiclogical and clinical viewpoints.The conventional methods for cholinesterase determination include 1 the Takahashi and Shibata method in which acetyl choline is used as a substrate and variation of the pH resulting from its decomposition is measured, and 2 a method in which benzoylcholine is used as a substrate, choline liberated from the benzoylcholine is oxidised with cholinoxidase to liberate hydrogen peroxide H202 , the hydrogen peroxide is subjected to reaction with phenol and 4 aminoantipyrine in the presence of peroxidase to produce a quinonimine dye, and the concentration of the quinonimine dye produced is colorimetrically measured. However, such conventional methods have disadvantages.The above method 1 requires complicated steps and the above method 2 does not give very precise results. It is an object of the present invention to provide a simple method for determining the activity of cholinesterase. According to the present invention, there is provided a method of determining the activity of cholinesterase comprising the steps of mixing a liquid containing a cholinesterase with a substrate solution containing hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate in reduced form NADPH and hydroxybenzoyl choline having the following formula EMI2.1 and measuring the decrease in absorbance of light by NADPH as a measure of the activity of cholinesterase in the solution thereby indicating the consumption of NADPH in accordance with the amount of cholinesterase present in said liquid. Hydroxybenzoyl choline having the following formula is used as a synthetic substrate EMI2.2 A cholinesterase containing liquid such as a serum is added to a solution containing hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate in reduced form hereinafter referred to as NADPH and hydroxybenzoyl choline. Hydroxybenzoic acid is produced from hydroxybenzoyl choline by the action of cholinesterase. The hydroxybenzoic acid is converted to dihydroxybenzoic acid by the action of hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase in the presence of NADPH. The consumption of NADPH is measured by measuring the decrease in absorbance of light by NADPH.The cholinesterase activity of the serum is determined from the decrease in absorbance by calculation. In the procedure mentioned above, one may use phydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, in which case p hydroxybenzoyl choline is used as the substrate or one may use m hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, in which case the substrate is m hydroxybenzoyl choline. The following examples illustrate the invention EXAMPLE 1 Preparative The synthetic substrate which is used in the method of the present invention, a hydroxybenzoyl choline, was synthesized as follows A Synthesis of p hydroxybenzoyl choline iodide 0.1 M of ethylene chlorohydrin and 0.1 M of phydroxybenzoic acid were added to 50 mt of chloroform, and to the mixture was added 0.5 m of fluorosulphuric acid. 0After the mixture had been kept at 60 C for 4 days while under reflux, the mixture was heated at a temperature of 850C on a water bath to remove the solvent. After the residue had been dissolved in chloroform and the solution had been washed three times with a 1 aqueous solution of NaHC03 and then three times with distilled water, the layer of chloroform was separated off and then chloroform was evaporated from the chloroform solution to leave a residue of 2 chloroethyl p hydroxybenzoate. 170 g 1 M of anhydrous sodium iodide were then added to 1.2 4 of methyl ethyl ketone and the mixture was heated on a steam bath for one hour. 0.9 M of 2 chloroethyl p hydroxybenzoate was added to the mixture and reaction was allowed to take place for 24 hours. After the precipitate which formed was filtered off the filtrate was washed with a 10 aqueous solution of sodium bisulphite and a 5 aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate, and was then washed with 100 mt of distilled water. The layer of methyl ethyl ketone which formed was separated off and 7 g of anhydrous magnesium sulphate was added to the methyl ethyl ketone layer to achieve drying of it. The solid matter was removed by filtration and the filtrate obtained was heated in an evaporator to remove the solvent and yield 2 iodoethyl p hydroxybenzoate. 0.7 M of the 2 iodoethyl p hydroxybenzoate thus formed was dissolved in 200 mt of acetone, and to the solution were added 270 mt of a 19.5 solution of trimethylamine in acetone. Reaction was then allowed to take place for 24 hours. The precipitate produced was filtered off, and the acetone layer was separated off and put in a vacuum desiccator to remove acetone. 20 g of p hydroxybenzoyl choline iodide were obtained as a residue. B Synthesis of m hydroxybenzoyl choline chloride A mixture of 5 g of m hydroxybenzoic acid, 5 g of choline chloride and 5 mZ of 18N H2SO4 was heated under reflux for 26 hours and then the pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 4.0. The solid matter present was filtered off, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was separated by silica gel chromatography to give m hydroxybenzoyl choline chloride. EXAMPLE 2 To determine the activity of cholinesterase which is contained in a serum,5 21 of the serum were added to 1 mt of a solution pH 7.5 containing 0.1 mM of p hydroxybenzoyl choline iodide, 0.6 U of p hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase, 0.2 mM of NADPH and 20 mM of phosphate buffer. The decrease of the absorbance by the solution was measured at 340 nm of light at a temperature of 300C during the course of the reaction. During the determination, use was made of a reaction rate analyser LKB 2086 made and sold by Clinicon Co., Sweden in which the time lag was 10 seconds and the reaction time was 2 minutes. The activity unit U of cholinesterase was automatically printed out in the analyzer.The calculation of activity was performed according to the following formula U Decrease in absorbance at 340 nm Reaction time 5 min w Reaction time 5 min 1 1 Molecular extinction x Light path length coefficient e cm 1.005 3 0.005 x 103 3 e 6.22 x 10 Molecular extinction coefficient of NADPH The results of the measurements, repeated 30 times, were as follows Activity unit U 180 X 350 nmol me min Coefficient of variation CV 3.8 EXAMPLE 3 The procedure and calculation of Example 1 were repeated to determine activity unit U and Coefficient of variation CV but using 0.1 mbl of m hydroxybenzoyl choline chloride and 3 U of m hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase instead of 0.1 mM of p hydroxybenzoyl choline iodide and 0.6 U of p hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase. Activity unit U 200 X 400 nmol ml min Coefficient of variation CV 3.798
