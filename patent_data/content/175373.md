# Insoluble and infusible substrate with a polyacen type skeletal structure.

## Abstract
An insoluble and infusible substrate with a polyacen type skeletal structure having a hydrogen carbon atomic ratio of from 0.05 to 0.60 and a specific surface area, measured by the BET method, of at least 600mÂ² g, said substrate being a heat treated product of a mixture comprising an aromatic condensation poly mer consisting of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen as a matrix and a fiber member selected from the group consisting of phenol resin fibers, heat treated phenol resin fibers and carbon fibers dis persed therein. The substrate has excellent physical properties such as strength and is useful as an electrode for organic cell.
