# Current spreading circuit.

## Abstract
A current spreading circuit which in a preferred embodi ment is constructed as a power supply circuit having higher power factor and decreased current crest factor. The circuit preferably comprises an input circuit means for receiving an input AC voltage and rectifying this voltage and output circuit means for providing a DC output voltage. Pulse width modulation means intercouple between the input and output circuit means and include means adapted to pass input AC current in pulse width increments with the pulse width varying in inverse proportion to the AC voltage. In this manner, when the instantaneous AC voltage is low, the pulse widths are wider and conversely when the voltage is high, the pulse widths are narrower. In one version of the invention, the pulse width modulation is carried out by means of a programmed variable ratio transformer. In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the current spreading circuit is of a quasi cosecant type while in another preferred embodiment of the invention, input there is a combination of pulse width modulation with a typical filter circuit including an OR circuit at the output to provide the necessary combining.
