BACKGROUND OF THE IN JTION Field of the InventionThe present invention generally relates to a method of treatment of plants. More particularly, the invention relates to an improved method of plant pest control.Background of the Prior ArtPesticides are chemicals designed to combat the attacks of various pests on agricultural and horticultural crops.They fall into three major classes insecticides,fungicides and herbicides or weed killers . There are also rodenticides for control of vertebrate pests , nematicides to kill microscopic eelworms , molluscicides to kill slugs and snails and acaracides to kill mites .Pesticides may also be divided into two main types, namely contact or nonsystemic pesticides and systemic pesticides. Contact or surface pesticides do not appreciably penetrate plant tissues and are consequently not transported or translocated, within the plant vascular system.The earlier insecticides, fungicides and herbicides were of this type their disadvantages are that they are susceptible to the effects of weathering wind, rain and sunlight over long periods and new plant growth will be left unprotected and hence open to attack by insect and fungal pests. The early agricultural fungicides were, therefore, protectant fungicides in other words they are designed to prevent the development of the fungal spores, but once the fungus has become established and infection starts to ramify through the plant tissue such nonsystemic fungicides possess little eradicant action and usually cannot halt the infection.In contrast, many of the more recent pesticides are systemic in character these can effectively penetrate the plant cuticle and move through the plant vascular system.Examples are provided by the phenoxyacetic acid selective herbicides, certain organophosphorus insecticides and the more recently discovered systemic fungicides like benomyl.Systemic fungicides are also sometimes termed plant chemotherapeutants and can not only protect the plant from fungal attack but also cure or inhibit an established infection. They are little affected by weathering and will also confer immunity on all new plant growth.Pests can be divided into various groups. In the plant kingdom, characterized by the ability of the organism to photosynthesize carbohydrates from air and water with the aid of the green pigment chlorophyll, higher plants growing where man does not want them are termed weeds and are important pests. Of the lower plants, algae are not generally of as great importance as pests, although in some circumstances, e.g., in lakes and other slow moving water, excessive algal growth or bloom may cause considerable damage and require treatment with chemicals algicides . Fungi or nonphotosynthetic plants cannot obtain their nutrients from air and water since they do not have chlorophyll consequently they feed directly on decaying plant or animal matter saprophytic fungi or on living plants or animals parasitic fungi . There are thousands of different species of fungi mainly found in soil some, like yeasts, are unicellular while others are composed of a network of branched filaments hyphae . A number of fungi are serious pests attacking both living crop plants and also crops in storage.Several bacteria are causal agents of plant diseases, although they are not nearly as important as the phytopathogenic fungi. Bacteria can be observed under the microscope and can be classified according to their shape thus a spherical bacterium is termed a coccus while a rod shaped one is a bacillus.Viruses, like bacteria and fungi, attack plants and animals and some species cause significant plant dieseases.Viruses form a distinct category of living organism because they are not true cells. Unlike bacteria they are too small 100 300 A in diameter to be observed with an ordinary microscope, but they can be revealed under the electron microscope each virus consists of a single strand of DNA or RNA surrounded by a protective coat of protein.Several higher animals vertebrates are important pests, e.g., mice, rats and rabbits another group of pests is represented by the true insects arthropods which are invertebrates. The latter possess three pairs of legs and the adult body has three parts the arachnids mites and ticks differ from true insects in having no distinct division of the body into three parts also they usually have four pairs of legs. In the lower orders of animals, certain nematodes, parasitic worms often with unsegmented bodies, are important crop pests. If pesticides are to be active they must reach the ultimate site of action within the target organism. Thus even surface fungicides, like Bordeaux mixture, must be able to penetrate the fungal spore similarly contact insecticides have to penetrate the insect cuticle, and contact herbicides the plant cuticle when they impinge on it. The requirements if the pesticides are to be systemic in action are much more stringent because in addition they must have the capacity to be absorbed by the roots or leaves or seeds of plants and be delivered to other parts of the plant. In this way the whole plant, including new growth, is protected from fungal attack, or rendered poisonous to any insect that eats or sucks it. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONI have now discovered an improved method of plant pest control by enhancing the delivery of pesticides to plant pests. The foregoing is accomplished through the use of a compound which,wben combined with a pesticide, enhances the delivery of the pesticide to plant pests. The composition containing the delivery enhancing compound and pesticide may be applied directly to the plant pest by topical application or indirectly by topical application to the plants to be protected. The latter indirect method of application enables the pesticide to reach its ultimate site of action, namely the plant pest, after the plant pest has come in contact with the treated plant.The invention, therefore, relates to an improved method of plant pest control comprising contacting a plant or plant pest with a composition comprising an effective amount of a plant pesticide and an effective, deliveryenhancing amount of a compound having the structural formula EMI5.1 where R1 is H or a lower alkyl group having 1 4 carbon atoms, m is 3 7, n is 0 17, and R is CH3,EMI5.2 orEMI5.3 where R is H or halogen and R has the same meaning as above. The invention also relates to a composition comprising a surfactant suitable for use as a herbkideadjuvant and an effective, pesticide enhancing amount of a compound having the structural formulaEMI5.4 wherein R is H or a lower alkyl group having 1 4 carbon atoms, m is 3 7, n is 0 17 and R is CH3,EMI5.5 orEMI5.6 where R is H or halogen, with the proviso that if m is 3 and R is CH3, then n is 5 17.The invention also relates to a composition comprising an effective amount of a plant pesticide and an effective, pesticide enhancing amount of a compound having the structural formula EMI6.1 wherein R is H or a lower alkyl group having 1 4 carbon atoms, m is 3 7, n is 0 17 and R is CH3,EMI6.2 orEMI6.3 where R is H or halogen, with the proviso that if m is 3 and R is CM3, then n is 5 17.In one preferred embodiment, R is H, m is 5 7, R is CH3 and n is 0 11. The preferred compound is 1 n dodecylazacycloheptan 2 one. DETAILED DESCRITPION OF THE INVENTIONThe 1 substituted azacycloalkan 2 ones used in this invention are made by methods described below and as further described in the Examples. Typical examples of compound included in the foregoing formula are the following 1 n hexylazacyclopetan 2 one 1 n heptylazacyclopentan 2 one 1 n octylazacyclopentan 2 one 1 n nonylazacyclopentan 2 one 1 n decylazacyclopentan 2 one 1 n dodecylazacyclopentan 2 one 1 methylazacycloheptan 2 one 1 n propylazacycloheptan 2 one 1 n butylazacycloheptan 2 one 1 n pentylazacycloheptan 2 one 1 n hexylazacycloheptan 2 one 1 n heptylazacycloheptan 2 one 1 n octylazacycloheptan 2 one 1 n nonylazacycloheptan 2 one 1 n decylazacycloheptan 2 one 1 n dodecylazacycloheptan 2 one 1 n butylazacyclononan 2 one 1 n octylazacyclononan 2 one 1 phenylazacyclopentan 2 one 1 benzylazacyclopentan 2 one 1 2 chlorphenyl azacyclopentan 2 one 1,3 Bis 1 azacyclopentan 2 onyl propan 1,6 Bis 1 azacyclopentan 2 onyl hexan.The compounds covered by the general formula may be prepared by treating an azacycloalkan 2 one with an alkyl or aralkyl halide or mesylate in the presence of a base,e.g., sodium hydride. The reaction is carried out under anhydrous conditions in a hydrocarbon solvent, for example, dry toluene at reflux temperature for about 10 to 72 hours in an inert atmosphere, for example, nitrogen.This method is outlined below EMI7.1 tb SEP 0 SEP 0 tb SEP C SEP R SEP C tb SEP MM SEP aM SEP SEP SEP tb CM2 m SEP N M SEP N, SEP z SEP CE2 m SEP N SEP Na SEP R halide tb CH, SEP SEP or tb SEP R mesylate tb SEP 0 tb SEP I tb SEP R SEP C tb SEP CH2 m SEP N SEP SEP R tb In the above method, substitution of an equimolar ratio of a dibromoalkane in place of an alkyl halide givesBis N azacycloalkan 2 onyl alkane.Alternatively, a lactone of analkanoic acid may be heated with an alkyl, aryl or nZkyl amine with or without solvent for about 20 to 72 hours at about 180 2500C with removal of water to obtain the corresponding 1 substituted azacycloalkan 2 one shown below EMI8.1 Similarly, heating a lactone of an alkanoic acid with a diaminoalkane in a 2.5 to 1 molar ratio gives the Bis Nazacycloalkan 2 onyl alkane.In another method gamma dialkylaminobutyric acid may be treated with phosphorous trihalide and the resulting acid halide which need not be isolated is heated, resulting specifically in the formation of N alkylazacyclopentan 2one. Suitable acid halide forming agents include phosphorous trichloride, phosphorous tribromide, thionyl chloride etc. The acid halide is formed at room temperature and then the reaction temperature is raised to 70 gOOC. One of the alkyl groups on the amino nitrogen of the parent acid is eliminated as alkyl halide. If the alkyl groups on the amino nitrogen are different, the smaller of the two alkyl groups is eliminated preferentially. This method is decribed below.EMI8.2 Typical plant pesticides include conventional pesticides, including, but not limited to, insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, rodenticides, nematicides,molluscicides, acaricides, plant growth regulators, fumigants, antifeeding compounds, chemosterilants, hormones, growth inhibitors, etc. The amount of 1 substituted azacycloheptan 2 one which may be used in the present invention is an amount effective for enhancing the delivery of a pesticide to a plant pest. In the case of indirect application of the active materials to a plant, the enhanced delivery achieved through the use of the 1 substituted azacycloheptan 2 one includes improved substantivity and systemic effects of the pesticide. Generally, an effective amount ranges between about 0.01 to about 99.9 and preferably about 0.1 to 10 percent by weigth of the pesticide composition.Suitable pesticides include botanical insecticides such as, for example, nicotine, derris rotenone and pyrethrum synthetic insecticides including dinitrophenols, such as, for example, DNOC organic thiocyanates such as, for example, lethane and thanite organochlorine insecticides including DDT and related compounds hexachlorocyclohexane insecticides containing the cyclodiene group such as, for example, aldrin and dieldren organophosphorous insecticides including malathion, mevinphos, rogar, dimethoate, nenozan, miral, diazinon, dursbon, bayrusil organocarbonate insecticides including pirimicarb, carbaryl, baygon, propoxur, zectron, carbofuran, aldicarb Temik , methomul Lonnate fungicides including phenylmercury compounds, naban, metham sodium, thiron compounds containing the n trichloromethylthio group, such as, for example, captan, folpet and oifolatan dinitrophenols, including dinocap Karathane chlorobenzynes and related compounds, quinones such as, for example, dodine and roural, sulphonamides benzimidozoles thiophonates oxathiins pyrimadines piperozine, morpholine and azepine derrivatives organophosphorous compounds including wepsyn, kitazin and conen, herbicides including carboxylic acid herbicides, such as, for example, 2,4 D MCPA, 2,3,6 TBA, IAA, picloram and dichlobenil chloroaliphatic acids such as dalapan and TCA, and heterocyclic compounds such as atrozine Gesaprim triazale such as amitrole, pyrazon, bromacil, endothal bipyridinum herbicides including paraquat and diquat benzonitriles diphenyl ethers organophosphorous compounds such as, for example, phosphorothiolates such as bensulide phosphoramidates such as DMPA Zytron phosphonates such as glyphosate plant growth regulators fumigants roclenticides including anticoagulants such as warfarin, pidone and norbormide Raticote sleep in icing narcotic drugs such as chloralose gophacide, si latrane and crimidine nematicides such as dazomet and nellite molluscicides such as metaldehyd, methiocasb and frescon repellants, antifeeding compounds such asZIP chemosterilants, hormones and growth inhibitors.

Surfactants are used with the vehicles in ratios between 1 to 10 parts surfactant to vehicle to 10 to 1 parts surfactant to vehicle and preferably in the range of 1 to 3 parts surfactant to vehicle to 3 to 1 parts surfactant to vehicle.An especially useful composition comprises Triton X 100 and the vehicle 1 n dodecylaza cycloheptan 2 one in a ratio between 1 to 3 and 3 to 1 parts of surfactant to vehicle and preferably 3 parts surfactant to 2 parts vehicle.Other suitable adjuvants, surfactants and herbicides include those set forth in Adiuvants for Herbicides, 1982,Published by the Weed Society of America, 309, West ClarkStreet, Champaign, Illinois, edited by R. Hodgson.The precise amount of the pesticide composition to be delivered to the plant or pest will obviously be an effective amount for the desired result expected therefrom. Most modern pesticides are used in agriculture at a dosage of less than one pound per acre. This, of course, will be ascertained by the ordinary skill of the practitioner. Due to enhanced activity which is achieved, the dosage of agent may often be decreased from that generally applicable. In accordance with the usual prudent formulating practices, a dosage near the lower end of the useful range of the particular agent may be employed initially and the dosage increased as indicated from the observed response.The examples which follow illustrate the vehicles which may be used in carrying out the method of the present invention. Temperatures are given in degrees Centigrade.All reactions involving sodium hydride were carried out in an inert nitrogen atmosphere.

EXAMPLE 24The herbicidal activity of a commercially available pesticide, glyphosate Monsanto Chemical Company Roundup R in combination with varying concentrations of the vehicle 1 n dodecyl azacycloheptan 2 one was tested on two common weeds Hybrid Bermuda grass Cymodon Doctylon and St. Augustine1s grass Stenotaphrum Secundatum . The glyphosat was tested at the midrange of the manufacturer s recommended spray solution concentration of 1.5 and at 1 4 of this concentration or 3 8 . The vehicle was used at four concentrations of 0.1 , 1.096, 2.0 and 5 . The test solutions were made up with the indicated concentrations of glyphosate and vehicle in aqueous compositions containing 18 ethanol and 6 Tween 20 and applied in a fine mist with a delivery of 0.3 g of solution made to each 4.4 sqare inch test site. Thereafter, the test sites were watered for 20 minutes each 48 hours for 17 days. The results of the 17 day study showed that the vehicle effeczively enhanced the herbicidal activity of glyphosate at a concentration of 1.5 substantially reducing kill time compared to 1.5iS glyphosate alone. The studies further demonstrated that the vehicle also potentiated the herbicidal effect of glyphosate at 1 4 of the recommended dilution of 3 8 . The best results were achieved with vehicle concentrations of 1 or higher.
