# Two stage solenoid valve.

## Abstract
Solenoid valves for providing either of two desired fluid flow rates, comprising two coaxial armatures, are known. In the present valve, the lower armature 22 has a sealing ring 18 which seals against an outlet passage rim 50 , and has an internal bore 36, 38, 40 with an upper rim 44 . The upper armature 24 has a sealing member 58 which seals against rim 44 . Figure 1 shows the valve in the closed position. For a low flow rate, the upper armature 24 is raised by energizing coil 74 , to allow fluid flow up grooves 37 in the lower armature and through the bore therein. For a high flow rate, the lower armature 22 is also raised by energizing coil 72 , so sealing off the bore passage but opening the flow path direct from chamber 12 to outlet passage 14 .
