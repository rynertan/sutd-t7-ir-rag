## Description
Composites and Methods for Providing Metal Clad Articles and Articles Produced TherebyFIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to composites for providing metal clad articles of thermosetting resin, methods of making the metal clad articles and metal clad articles so produced.BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Fibre reinforced plastics FRP laminates especially those based on thennnsetting resins such as unsaturated polyesters, vinyl esters, epoxides, phenolics, furans and silicones have found wide use in industry. By correct choice of resin type and reinforcement the laminates can be used in the production of pipes, ducts, tanks, vessels for chemical plant, cladding and decorative panels for building, containers, tanks and pipes for potable liquids and foodstuffs, boats, cars and commercial vehicles, railway coaches, and many other applications. However there are some aggresive environments that attack some or all the resin matrices that are used. This disadvantage has been overcome in some instances by the use of thermoplastics such as rigid polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene or fluorinated ethylene propylene copolymers as facings to the laminate, Even so there are applications where metals such as aluminium or stainless steel perform better than FRP or FRP with a thermoplastic facing but where the lightness and load bearing properties of FRP would be an advantage. Very thin sheets of metals e.g. stainless steel down to about 0.008cm thick are now available and many applications can be foreseen where a material of this type with a FRP backing could be used, namely decorative metal faced building panels, metal faced sectional water tanks, metal lined pipes, ducts and tanks and metal faced components for the transport industry. Unfortunately, little or no adhesion can be obtained between stainless steel and thermosetting resins such as standard unsaturated polyesters and vinyl esters even with careful preparation of the stainless steel surface. It has been stated that some resins such as epoxides or polyurethanes are self bonding on to stainless steel B.F.2,061,834 but these suffer from other disadvantages such as cost epoxides and low stiffness polyurethanes . We have found a way by which excellent adhesion can be obtained between a metal and those thermosetting resins which are not generally considered as being capable of bonding to metal. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the invention there is provided a composite for providing a metal clad article, which composite includes a metal facing, a curable thermosetting resin and, between the metal facing and the resin, a layer of adhesive material capable of adhesion to the metal facing and to the thermosetting resin upon curing of said resin to form an adhesive bonding therewith. On subjecting the composite to a curing operation, a metal clad article in accordance with the invention is provided in which the metal facing is efficiently and easily bound to the thermoset resin by the adhesive. A method aspect of the invention includes the steps of providing, en the metal facing, a layer of adhesive material capable of adhesion to the metal facing, laying up on said layer of adhesive material a curable thermosetting resin, and curing the thermosetting resin, thereby bonding the adhesive material to the resin to provide the said metal clad article . Any forming of the metal to a desired profile is carried out prior to bonding it to the other materials. The method of the invention is particularly applicable to the formation of profiled metal clad laminates of fibre reinforced thermosetting resin. It is valuable that the method of the invention is a lamination onto the metal surface rather than the adhesion of the metal surface to a preformed laminate. Thus the cladding of the metal takes place at the same time as the formation cure of the laminate when the thermosetting resin is brought together with the adhesive material and metal. This enables the adhesive material to bind with the thermosetting resin of the laminate on curing thus providing a surprisingly excellent adhesive bond between metal and laminate. Excellent adhesion may be obtained between the metal and thermosetting resin by treating the metal surface with an adhesive material selected from a wide range of primers adhesives the choice of which is explained in more detail hereinafter, allowing it to dry or cure and applying the thermosetting resn plus reinforcement if required in the uncured state and then curing the thermoset.The thermosetting resins may be applied combined with reinforcement if required in either the wet state by standard processes e.g. hand lay up, spray up, filament winding, resin injection, with or without vacuum assistance, cold press moulding, flexible bag moulding, rotational moulding pultrusion etc and cured at ambient or elevated temperatures or as pre impregnated material or formulated moulding material such as sheet moulding compounds SMC or its high performance derivatives HMC, XMG , bulk moulding compounds DIC , dough moulding compounds DMC , granules etc. pressed into contact with the treated surface and cured by heating under conventional hot press moulding conditions. The metals can be formed into shape before lamination for example by pressing, cutting and welding, bending and stitching etc. When the thermoset resin is reinforced, this is preferably achieved using reinforcing fibres of, for example, glass, silica, carbonJKEVLAR and similar polyaramids, and natural fibres such as jute. The reinforcing fibre may be provided by at least one layer of fibrous material and this is preferably preimpregnated with the thermosetting resin prepreg . Alternatively the fibres may be distributed within the thermosetting resin, as for example is the case with DMC. Available adhesives are classified generally by their chemical nature Adhesives Directory 1981, Wheatland Journals late, Rickmansworth a Natural Products, e.g. starch, bone glue, b Cellulosics, e.g. cellulose acetate, c Elastomerics, e.g. natural rubber, d Synthetic Rubbers, e.g. nitrile, Neoprene styrene butadiene, e Thermoplastics, e.g. cyanoacrylates, hot melts e.g. ethylene vinyl acetate, polyamide polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl butyral, acrylic and copolymers, f Thermosets, e.g. addition polymers such as epoxides, polyesters, vinyl esters, urethane acrylates, urethanes, anaerobic acrylics or condensation polymers e.g. phenol formaldehyde, urea formaldehyde, g Inorganic, e.g. sodium silicate. We find that, in general, adhesives of groups a , b and g do not work. In particular, inorganic adhesives g tend to be too rigid to form good bonds with the thermosetting resins forming the laminate. Preferred adhesive materials are those selected from group f and certain members of groups c , d and e , though we find that aqueous based adhesives within these latter groups in emulsion form tend to be inferior. Such aqueous based adhesives may,however, provide adequate adhesion on hot curing of the thermosetting resin forming the laminate. The adhesive capability of an adhesive material is regarded as good if the resultant metal clad laminate has a lap shear of at least 3, and preferabiy, t 3.5 Megapascals MPa . It is strongly preferred that the lap shear strength be no less that 2.5 MPa. The choice of adhesive material depends upon the nature of the thermosetting resin which is to form the laminate the adhesive material must be compatible with the resin and the metal facing to be provided. It depends also upon the conditions of curing to be employed. Some adhesive materials provide good results only when used with a hot cured laminate and certain of the thermoplastics, natural and synthetic rubbers fall into this category. Such hot curing is generally carried out at a temperature in the range 100 2000C, preferably 140 1600C, more preferably 1500C, and usually under pressure about 1000 2000 psi, preferably 1500 psi . On the other hand, other adhesive materials provide good results when used with a cold curd or a hot cured laminate, these including certain thermosetting resms and synthetic rubbers. Such cold curing is generally carried out at about ambient temperature, but may be followed by a post curing step in which the material is heated to say 30 200C, preferably at least 40 C. For excellent results both on cold and hot curing of the laminate, an adhesive is selected which a provides a good key to the metal surface there are certain adhesives known to be useful for bonding metal to metal and some of these, though not all, are useful in the method of the present invention , b is flexible, tough or resilient, i.e. having low modulus and c is curable by crosslinking with minimum shrinkage before application of the laminating resin system. Examples of adhesives which may give good results though in some cases hot curing of the laminate is required are thermosetting resins which contain polyurethane linkages and optionally additionally include acrylic especially acrylate linkages or terminal groups, acrylic resins especially anaerobic acrylics , epoxy resins, unsaturated polyesters provided that theyftrm sufficiently flexible layers on curing , polymers containing vinyl acetate residues, nitrile rubbers, polyolefine and nitrile hot melt adhesives, cyanoacrylates, neoprene and natural rubbers. Those adhesive materials which provide good results on hot curing of the laminate include polymers hot meltpolyolefins which may contain vinyl acetate residues. Epoxy resins are also preferred for hot curing but will give excellent results on cold curing of certain thermosetting resins which form the laminate, e.g. epoxy thermosetting resins. Some, though few adhesivematerials, e.g. cyanoacrylates, give good results on cold curing of the laminate, but not on hot curing. Adhesives which, in general, give excellent results both on cold and hot curing of the laminate include acrylics especially anaerobic acrylics , certain unsaturated polyesters as later described, thermosetting resins which contain polyurethane linkages and optionally additionally contain acrylic especially acrylate linkages or terminal groups, and nitrile rubbers. In particular, nitrile rubbers provide excellent adhesion when used with a cold cured laminate. This range of adhesives allows for a particularly wide choice of metal, thermosetting resin and curing conditions and this versatility is surprising. For example, although nitrile rubbers are known adhesives they have, in general, been applied only by hot curing in conventional adhesion processes. This contrasts with the excellent results we obtain on cold curing. Excellent results can be achieved on cold curing, especially with the abovementioned range of adhesives.This enables the process to be carried out without having to apply heat, thus saving energy and rendering it easier and more economical to perform. We also find that particularly excellent results may be achieved if the adhesive is allowed or caused to cure completely before the thermosetting resin is laid on it. This is especially so for cold curable resins, e.g. epoxy resins, acrylics, nitrile rubbers and urethanes. An especially preferred adhesive is one containing polyurethane linkages with terminal acrylate groups. The preparation of a typical urethane acrylate of this type is described below. 1.OM Sorbitol and 18.OM Caprolactone were charged to a suitable reaction vessel and heated to 90 100 C with stirring. A cloudy homo geneous dispersion was obtained to which was added 0. p toluene sllphonic acid. An exothermic reaction began almost instantaneously and the temperature rose peaking at 140 1 500C. The batch was allowed to cool naturally for 15 minutes and was then vacuum stripped. Less than 2 of charge weight was removed. After stripping, the temperature was adjusted to 100 1100C and 3.5M isophorone di isocyanate was added. A gentle exotherm began and the batch temperature was allowed to rise to 120 130 C where it was controlled by cooling. When the exotherm was over, the batch was cooled to 90 95 C and 3.5M 2 hydroxy ethyl acrylate and lOOppm hydroquinone were added.A below the surface feed of air was started and the temperature was adjusted to 80 85 C. The batch was maintained at this temperature until the isocyanate content was less than 0.6 equivalent to 95 conversion . The batch was then dissolved in styrene to provide a composition containing approximately 60 solids by weight. Although the most successful treatments are found to be based on anaerobic acrylics, urethanes, urethane acrylics and nitrile rubbers, certain other treatments are usable if the three conditions above are fulfilled. For example, standard unsaturated polyesters do not give any adhesion due to their being too rigid and exhibiting too great a shrinkage on cure. However, using a specially fonrmlated unsaturated polyester with an elongation at break in cured form of 50 and lower shrinkage than normal good bonding is achieved. Again epoxy materials are well known metal adhesives but unless well cured prior to the application of the thermosetting resin which is to form the laminate with resins other than epoxides they give rise to interfacial problems through either attack of solvents on the partially cured epoxy or inhibition of the cure of the FRP by substances leached from the partially cured epoxy. The adhesive material may be used in any suitable form, .g., dissolved in a solvent, as a melt, as ao wdet,or as a discrete sheet of material. It may be a single or two component system. Depending upon the form of adhesive selected, it may be applied to the metal surface by brush, spray etc or simply laying upon the metal surface and as some adhesive materials are anaerobic i.e. only cure properly in the absence of air, a thin sheet of PTFE can be laid over the coat of material and left in place until the adhesive layer is cured when it is removed before subsequent lamination.An alternatiXve, though less preferred method of obtaining adhesion is to apply the adhesive to the metal and before it cures to apply reinforcement e.g. glass chopped strand mat to the surface so that some of the fibres are in the adhesive layer whilst most are protruding. Some adhesive materials are available as hot melt films which can be melted on to the metal before subsequent lamination or if the whole structure is to be cured by hot pressing laid between the metal and the moulding composition or pre impregnated material. The thermosetting resins used to make the laminates may, for example, be unsaturated polyesters, vinyl esters, urethanes, acrylates, epoxides, phenolic resins, furans, or silicones, and may be copolymers, e.g urethane acrylates.Preferred resins are unsaturated polyesters, phenolic resins, furane resins and epoxy resins. They may be compounded with thixotropic agents e.g. gaseous silicas, fillers e.g. natural and precipitated calcium carbonates, clays, talc, mica, silica, hydraulic cements and pigments if required. The curing of these laminates can be, in the case of polyesters, vinyl esters and urethane acrylates, by organic peroxides and heat, organic peroxides plus so called accelerators, visible or U.V. light, electron beams and in the case of epoxides by the well known curing agents and for furanes and phenolics the various catalysts available. The procedure is capable of being used with a mide range of metals in thicknesses of O.lmm upwards but normally the thinnest material would be used for economical reas ns. The metals include stainless steel, chromium, titanium, aluminium, tin, copper, lead, zinc, phosphor, bronze, nickel, Irolybdenum, galvanized steel, brass and mild steel.Good bondsXls measured by lap shear and peel strengths can be obtained when the metals are solvent degreased before application of ttre adhesive material but improved adhesion can be obtained by abrasion followed by a solvent wipe, alkaline or acid etching, Particularly preferred metal clad laminates of the invention are metal clad FRP laminates, Their structures combine the best features of the metals and FRP which can be summarised as i the high strength to weight ratio of FRP giving components of lower weight than if made wholly of metal, ii the imperviousness of metals which prevents moisture and other aggresive environmenb from attacking FRP and causing l6ng term loss of strength, blistering etc, iii the chemical resistance of metal such as stainless steel, titanium, nickel alloys etc. which allows a choice of metal according to the environment, iv the desirable hygienic properties of metals such as stainless steel for use in contact with foodstuffs and potable liquids, v very good reverse impact resistance as large loads can be sustained without failure of the metal facing, vi the fire resistance of the metal facing and absence of smoke which can be important for example inside a duct, vii the electrical properties of metals i.e, conductance and shielding, thin the decorative properties of metal i.e. in building panels. Metal clad laminates of the invention are thus extremely versatile and have a very wide range of uses particularly in structural application3 for example, in the production of pipes, ducts, tanks, vessels for chemical plant, cladding and decorative panels for building, containers, tanks and pipes for potable liquids and foodstuffs, boats, cars and commercial vehicles, railway coaches, and many other applications. There is no reason why the metal clad laminate should have only one metal face both faces could be metal and they need not be similar metals. Similarly sandwich structures with light weight cores can be formed having one or both faces of metal foils e.g. metal primer FRP foam or honeycomb FRP,or metal primer FRP foam or honeycomb FRP primer metal.DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Metal clad laminates embodying the invention, composites for providing them and methods of metal clad laminate formation will now be described in more detail with reference to the following Examples which include some comparative examples. The presently most preferred embodiments are those in which the laminate is cold cured.Example 1 A thin sheet of stainless steel 0.25mum thick was solvent degreased and coated with PERMABONDX F241 adhesive one component of a tpot acrylic system and Permabond initiator No. 1 hardener at 200g mê. This layer was covered by a polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE sheet until cured when it was peeled off. A glass fibre reinforced polyester laminate was then laid up on the treated metal surface using CRYSTIC 272 an isophthalic acid based unsaturated polyester resin suitably catalysed and accelerated and 4 layers of glass chopped strand mat 450g m2 at a resin glass ratio of 2.3 1. The polyester of the resultant composite was then allowed to cure at ambient temperature to form a metal clad laminate. When the polyester had cured it was extremely difficult to separate from the stainless steel facing lap shear strength 3.5 MPa . Example IA A sheet of stainless steel was coated with Permabond F241 a adhesive and a piece of satin weave glass fibre fabric 340g mê was immersed in an acetone solution of PermabondInitiator No. 1 9 pts by weight acetone part initiator and the acetone allowed to evaporate. The glass fibre was rolled on to the treated stainless steel surface and good adhesion was obtained. A glass fibre laminate was then laid up on the glass fabric using Crystic 272 suitably catalysed and accelerated 2 and 4 layers of glass chopped strand mat 450g m2 at a resin glass ratio of 2.3 1. After the GRP layers of the resultant composite had been allowed to cure at ambient temperature it was extremely difficult to separate them from the stainless steel facing.Example II XX The procedure of Example I was followed except that the treatments shown in Table I were used.

The treated metal was placed in the mould with the untreated side in contact with the lower mould surface and the mould loaded with CRYSTIC M125 a sheet moulding compound and reinforcing fibres to cover 70Z of the surface area. The mould was closed and pressing of the resultant composite took 4 minutes at 1500C under a pressure of 1,500 p.s.i. to effect curing. On opening the mould a stainless steel faced FBP sheet was obtained which was extremely strong with good adhesion between the FRP and the metal face single lap shear strength 5.5 MPa .

On impact testing it was found that theGRP laminate could be fractured without penetrating the stainless steel facing. There was good adhesion between the FRP and metal face single lap shear strength 3.5 SPa . Furthermore, after curing, the laminate was easily removed from the mould.. The mould walls were of chrome plated steel hence the laminate did not adhere to them.

After the glass reinforced phenolic resin of the resultant composite had been allowed to cure at ambient temperature it was difficult to separate from the stainless steel and the bond had a single lap shear strength of 3 MPa.Example LII Theme procedure as in Example LI was followed except that the laminating resin was a QUAKER furane resin. Example LIII A sheet of aluminium 0,5omm thick was solvent degreased and treated with PERMABOND E04 a two pot epoxy at 200g m2. This was allowed to cure ana a glass reinforced epoxide laminate laid up on the treated surface using 4 layers of chopped strand mat 450g m2 Epikote 828 Epicure at a resin glass ratio of 3 1.After the glass reinforced epoxide laminate of the resultant composite had been allowed to cure at ambient temperature it was extremely difficult to separate from the metal lap shear strength 6 MPa ,Examples LIV LVII A sheet of aluminium 0.25mm thick was solvent degrease and treated with INDASOL S419NF nitrile rubber adhesive at 2OOg m2. This was allowed to dry and one layer of 450g m2 CSM with Crystic 272 at a resin glass ratio of 2.5 1 was laid up on the treated surface.A 12.7mm thick PVC foam sheet was pushed into the wet resin layer and a 2 layer CSM 450g m2 per layer Crystic 272 laminate was laid up on top of the foam to form a composite which, on curing at ambient temperature, provided stiff metal clad foam cured laminate structure. This procedure was repeated using polyester foam as a replacement core material, phenolic foam as a replacement core material and polyurethane as a replacement core material. Example LVIII Metal faced sectional tank panels can readily be made using the techniques developed. A thin stainless steel sheet 4 4 square X 0.5mm thick bad four corner squares 2 x 2 cut from it and it was then olded to give a tray shaped sheet 4 x 44 flanges all round. The corners were joined by welding or soldering. The inside surface of the formed tray was solvent degreased and treated with a nitrile rubber adhesive at 200g mê and allowed to dry. The shaped primed metal tray was then transferred to the female tool in a press where it effectively became part of the tool. A charge of sheet moulding compound SMC CrysticX M125 sufficient to give the required thickness laminate was then loaded and the mould closed. Under the influence of pressure and heat the SMC of the resultant composite flowed and cured so that when released stainless steel clad FRP sectional tank panel was obtained.The bond between the stainless steel and the FRP was excellent and the panel had the following advantages over traditional steel or unfaced SMC panels a. the external SMC face requires minimal main tenance, b. the internal surface is a well known and trusted corrosion resistance surface acceptable in the food industry, c. the internal surface is impermeable and unlike SMC will not lose mechanical properties or blister on long contact with water, d. the internal surface is not broken when large impact loads are applied to the outer surface. Although the tray shape was made by cutting and welding the edges it can also be made by drawing the metal. Similar processes can be used to manufacture automotive body parts, printed circuit boards, filler plates, container panels etc.Example LIX Metal lined pipes can be formed by using the technique. A thin stainless steel sheet 0.25mm thick 12 inches wide was wound round a 12 diameter mandrel in a spiral fashion with a 1 overlap. The overlap joints were sealed using CRODAGRIP14 00300 a 2 pot polyurethane . The complete surface of the stainless steel was then covered with the same 2 pot polyurethane and allowed to dry to a layer 0,25aan thick. Glass fibre rovings impregnated with CRYSTIC 272 an isophthalic acid based unsaturated polyester resin suitably catalysed and accelerated were spirally wound on top of the primed stainless steel to give a reinforced layer 5mm thick. After allowing the resin of the resultant composite to cure at ambient temperature the pipe was removed from the mandrel. The thin stainless steel liner provided a perfect barrier to a wide range of chemical environments and the structural rigidity was provided by the FRP winding. Chemical tanks can be made by a similar process.Example LX Metal lined ducts and pipes were made by an alternative technique in which the 0.25mm stainless steel sheet 36 wide wHs joined longitudinally using an overlap joint and the metal chop bonded together with Crodagrip 14 00300 a two pot polyurethane . The 11 diameter metal liner was supported on a mandrel and the exterior surface was coated with a poly Hmctional acrylate terminated polymer containing urethane linkages which had been suitably catalysed and accelerated. The priming layer was allowed to cure and glass rovings impregnated with DERAKANE41145 suitably catalysed and accelerated were spirally wound on top of the primed metal to give a reinforced layer 5mm thick.After allowing the resin of the resultant composite to cure at ambient temperature the 12 diameter metal lined pipe thus produced was removed from the mandrel. Example LXI Larger diameter pipes and tanks can be made by longitudinally jointing more than one sheet of metal liner.This can be done by using a fold stitching pistol e.g.ATLAS COPCO Tagger 310 with a jointing film of PTFE tape between the metal faces and then folding over the jointed flange before applying a treatment of suitable adhesive.Thus 4 sheets of stainless steel 36 wide were joined together longitudinally as stated above to give the body of a circular tank approximately 45 diameter. This was placed on a mandrel and the external surface solvent degreased and coated with INDASOL MS 419NF. When the coating was dry glass fibre rovings impregnated with CRYSTIC272, suitably catalysed and accelerated were spirally wound on top of the primed steel to give a reinforced layer 5mm thick. The resultant composite provided, after curing at ambient temperature, a metal lined tank which was removed from the mandrel. Example LXII Thin aluminium sheet 0.45mm thick was abraded, degreased and coated with a polyfunctional acrylate terminated polymer containing urethane linkages which contained 80pphr taic filler, 2 suitably catalysed and accelerated, at 200g mê . After this had cured CRYSTICt272 resin contining 335 by weight silica hollow microspheres was suitably catalysed eIld accelerated and poured on to the sheet to a depth of lOtrin. After this layer of the resultant composite had beer. allowed to cure at ambient temperature, one layer of 450g m glass chopped strand mat was laid down and impregnated W Lth catalysed and accelerated CRYSTICD272. The resultant metal clad laminate could be used as a decorative building panel with the aluminium surface providing good weatherability.Example LXIII Two sheets of stainless steel were solvent degreased treated with INDASOL MS419NF and allowed to dry. A layer of sheet moulding compound was sandwiched between the two treated surfaces and the resultant composite cured under heat and pressure. The double faced metal coated laminate showed good adhesion at all the interfacial bond lines. Dissimilar metals can be used for each face to satisfy different environmental conditions.example LXIV A sheet of stainless steel 0.25no thick was solvent degreased and treated with INDASOLtMS419NF and allowed to dry. A laminate containing 6 layers of 300g m2 woven KEVLARrein forcement and CRYSTIC 2 at a resin fibre ratio of 1 1 was laid up on the primed steel. After the resin of the resultant composite had been allowed to cure at ambient temperatue, the resulting material was stronger and stiffer than an equivalent glass reinforced laminate due to the inherent better properties of KEVLAR fibres.Example LXV A thin satin finish stainless steel sheet was pressed and drawn to the shape of an automobile boot lid. It was degreased with solvent, the inside surface coated with CRODAGRIP 14 00300 at 200g m which was allowed to cure. The shaped primed steel was then placed in a two part mould and the requisite amount of continuons strand glass fibre mat, tailored to fit the mould, laid on to the primed surface.The mould was closed and suitably catalysed and accelerated CRYSTIC 272 an unsaturated polyester resin was injected into the mould until all the air in the mould had been pushed out. Injection of resin then ceased and the resin of the resultant composite was allowed to cure at ambient temperature. When the mould was opened a FRP boot lid was obtained with an attractive satin finish stainless steel face which had excellent adhesion to the FRP.
