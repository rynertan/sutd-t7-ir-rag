# Method of producing a GaAs JFET with self aligned p type gate.

## Abstract
A GaAs JFET according to the present invention is formed as follows. First, an n type active layer 23 is formed on a GaAs substrate 21 . Then, a gate electrode 33 con taining a group II element is formed on the n type active layer 23 . With the gate electrode 33 being used as a mask, an n type impurity is ion implanted in the GaAs substrate 21 with a high concentration in a self aligned fashion with re spect to the gate electrode 33 . Heat treatment is then per formed on the resultant structure to diffuse the group II element in the gate electrode 33 into the n type active layer, forming a p type gate region 41 . At the same time, the ion implanted n type impuriry is activated, forming source and drain regions 43, 45 .
