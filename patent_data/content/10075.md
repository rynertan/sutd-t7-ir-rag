# A demolition tool for breaking solid materials.

## Abstract
A demolition tool for breaking solid materials, particu larly rock or concrete in tunnelling, mining, demolishing and excavating applications. The tool has a single impactor 1 of projectile type which is driven by high pressure liquid towards the material to be broken. A gas pressure accumulator 2 is included for storing high pressure energy. This energy is transferred at a high rate through short, wide and streamlined channel means 8, 13, 57, 9 , having high capacity and low flow losses, to the impactor 1 . Valve means 7 is provided in the channel means so that the accumulator 2 can be recharged during the return stroke of the impactor, giving a high repetition rate. A low pressure annular accumulator 5 drives the impac tor during the return stroke.
