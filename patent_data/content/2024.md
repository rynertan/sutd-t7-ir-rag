# Hydrokinetic torque converter with a direct drive lock up clutch adapted for one way torque delivery.

## Abstract
A hydrokinetic torque converter mechanism 14 for use in an automotive vehicle driveline comprising a bladed impeller 38 , a bladed turbine 44 and a bladed stator 50 situated in toroidal fluid flow relationship, an impeller housing surrounding the bladed members, a lock up clutch structure 80, 82 in said housing adapted to establish a 6direct connection between said impeller and said turbine, said turbine being connected to a turbine shaft 12 that in turn is connected to torque input elements of a multiple ratio gear system, a one way coupling 94 located between said turbine shaft and said clutch structure for accommodating transfer of torque from said impeller to said turbine shaft but preventing torque transfer in the opposite direction thereby allowing coast braking of the driveline as the turbine tends to overrun the impeller but permitting direct mechanical torque transfer from the impeller to the turbine shaft during normal torque delivery, the driveability during coasting thereby being improved.
