# UPRIGHT VACUUM CLEANER TANK ASSEMBLY

## Abstract
An upright vacuum cleaner that includes floor engaging housing and an upright handle secured to a mounting bracket pivotally secured to the housing. The handle mount ing bracket includes side legs and an upper cross piece having mounting portions that extend outwardly beyond the side legs to which the handle is secured. The bracket is mounted to pivot about a generally horizontal pivot axis oriented perpendicular to the vacuum direction of travel. The handle abuts against surfaces on the mounting portion oriented parallel to the pivot axis, so that pushing forces are applied substantially against the mounting portions. An elongate cord channel is mounted on the handle. The cord channel includes a base and resiliently deformable sides that separate to allow receipt of an electrical cord between the sides. A vacuum tank housing with collecting bag support fastened to the handle has a standpipe with a curved upper portion that connects to the top of a collecting bag. The standpipe has an integrally formed flat to maintain the standpipe in the proper position abutting the tank housing. The vacuum motor includes an impeller and an guarded impeller opening which avoids restricting the air flow. The guard includes a screen surrounded by a non removable mounting ring secured around the impeller opening.
