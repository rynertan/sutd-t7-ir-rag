# Colour display tube.

## Abstract
By distorting in a colour display tube of the so called in line type the magnetic field which extends substantially parallel to the plane through the beam axes so as to be locally pincushion shaped by means of field shapers at the end of the electron gun system, the rasters written on the display screen by the three electron beams can be made to coincide and the deflection defocusing of the side beams is also strongly reduced without this costing much extra deflection energy.
