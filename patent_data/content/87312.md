# FORMATION OF REGIONS OF DIFFERENT CONDUCTIVITY TYPES IN A SUBSTRATE

## Abstract
The method allows the formation of regions of opposite conductivity types in a semiconductor substrate 100 utiliz ing a single masking step. A first mask is formed on the surface of the semiconductor substrate and patterned to define the regions 110 which are to be doped to a first conductivity type. Subsequent to the doping of these first regions, a protective layer 111 is formed over these first regions. The mask is then removed, thus exposing the regions 112 which are to be doped to the second conductiv ity type opposite to said first conductivity type. These exposed regions are then doped to said opposite conductiv ity type, with the first regions which have been doped to said first conductivity type protected by said protective layer.
