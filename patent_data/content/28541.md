## Description
AUTOMOBILE TRANSPORTATION PALLET The present invention relates to a transportation and storage pallet for automobiles to be used in an automated storage and retrieval system. Automated storage and retrieval systems for palletized goods are well known in the field of materials handling. Such systems permit large quantities of goods to be automatically stacked and stored in large high rise bins. Computerized inventory control and computer controlled movement of goods into and out of the storage bins has resulted in major cost savings in a variety of applications. Thus, automated materials handling systems are increasingly being used, even for such large scale projects as warehousing automobiles. However, as described in our co pending ApplicationNo. 80300788.9 filed 14th March 1980, herein incorporated by reference, some difficulties have been experienced in automated storage and retrieval systems designed for automobile warehousing. For example, each automobile must be transported within the storage system on a pallet.The pallets must be matched to correspond to the tire size and length of each car, thus necessitating use of many different sizes of pallets and causing some delay and inefficiency in the automated system. Problems have also been encountered in securing the automobiles to their pallets. During transportation, bad alignment arid movement of the autombiles on their pallets may cause the automated system to be shut down while the automobile is re aligned and re secured on its pallet in order to prevent it from slipping or rolling off the pallet as it is moved or hoisted. This of course causes further inefficiency and delay in the automated system. Another problem arises when the automobiles are stored in the high rise storage racks. The stored automobiles drip oil, grease and other fluids onto the automobiles below, thus creating an undesirable situation. Thus, what is needed is an improved pallet for transporting and storing automobiles in an automated storage and retrieval system. The pallet should be adjustable to accommodate different sizes of automobiles and should maintain proper alignment of the automobile in order to prevent movement thereof during transportation.The pallet should also be designed to protect other automobiles stored below in the storage rack from drippage. The present invention provides a pallet for transporting and storing automobiles characterised by a pair of tire channels, each said channel having a driving surface for the tires of said automobile and a tire pocket mounted on each said tire channel, said tire pockets being positioned so as to accommodate a given tire size and wheel base size in order to prevent movement of said automobile while transporting the pallet to and from storage. The automobile transportation and storage pallet of the present invention is designed for use in automated storage and retrieval systems, but can be used in any system for transporting and or storing automobiles. In use of a pallet in accordance with the present invention, an automobile is driven onto the pallet so that the tires follow the tire channels. Safety grip treads may be applied to the tire channels to provide additional traction. A drip pan may be interposed between the tire channels to collect dripping from the automobile. The tire pockets may comprise a plurality of adjustably mounted tire blocks, each pair of tire blocks forming one of said tire pockets. The tire pockets act to align and secure the tires of an automobile and prevent movement of the automobile during its transportation on the pallet. Such tire blocks can be adjusted to conform to any size of tire and automobile wheel base so that all sizes of automobiles may be transported and or stored, for example, in an automated warehousing system. One way of carrying out the present invention will now be described by way of example and not by way of limitation with reference to the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows a pallet of the present invention as used in an automated storage and retrieval system for automobiles. Figure 2 is a perspective view of the car ransportation pallet of the present invention. Figure 3 is a top plan view of the pallet of FJgure 2. Figure 4 is a cross sectional view of the pallet of Figure 3, taken along cutting plane line 4 4. Reference is now made to the drawing wherein like parts are designated with like numerals throughout. The automobile transportation and storage pallet of the present invention is designed for use in transporting and storing automobiles in automated storage and retrieval systems , although it can be used in any system for transporting and or storing automobiles.Such an automated system is generally illustrated inFigure 1. As shown in Figure 1, a high rise storage warehouse 20 comprises an array of storage bays 22 30. The storage bays 22 30 are separated by parallel aisles 1 5.The storage bin assemblies 22 30 are typically constructed of metal rack which open into the corresponding aisles 1 5. Each aisle is provided with a computer controlled storage retrieval S R machine 40, only one of which is illustrated in Figure 1. Automobiles, e.g. 42, fresh from the assembly line enter the system at 44 and are driven onto a pallet 46, described in more detail below. The pallet 46 has been previously placed in the pallet queue generally designated 48. The pallet queue 48 is part of an lelongated, essentially continuous conveyor 52 which runs eEsentially perpendicular to aisles 1 5. Conveyor 52 is preferably a chain driven conveyor. When the pallets 46 each the pallet queue area 48, air driven pop up sections not shown raise the pallets 46 off the moving chains and hold the pallets in the queued position for on loading. The high rise storage system is also provided with a second essentially continuous conveyor 54, conveyor 54 running essentially parallel to conveyor 52 and being similarly generally perpendicular to aisles 1 5.conveyor 54 is preferably a chain driven conveyor. Conveyor 54 is divided into three sections identified from right to left of Figure 1 as the input queue 56, transfer area 58 and output queue 60. Conveyor 52 and conveyor 54 are connected at the input end by conveyor 62 and at the output end by conveyor 64. Conveyors 62 and 64 are preferably chain driven line roller conveyors. It is pointed out that all of the queue areas including the empty pallet queue 48, the input queue 56 and the output queue 60 are provided with conventional air driven pop up sections that raise the pallets 46 off the moving chains until de energized, whereupon the pallets 46 are placed back on the moving chains for displacement by the conveyor. The automobile 42 is placed on the pallet 46 and a description thereof entered at the computer terminal 50.After the automobile has been driven onto pallet 46, the driver presses a button at terminal 50 which releases the palletized automobile to the input conveyor system under direction of the control system in the CPU not shown . Thereafter, thepalletized automobile may be transported for storage or subsequent retrieval by the computer controlled conveyors 52, 54 and S R Machine 40. As illustrated in Figures 2 and 3, the pallet generally designated 46 comprises two elongated steel tire channels 72 and 74. The steel used should be of sufficient strength to support the weight ofan automobile, such as 7 GA plate steel. Each tire channel 72, 74 provides a driving surface 76, 78 for the tires of an automobile, and are formed with side walls 80, 82 to keep the tires within tire channels 72, 74. Angular steel support member 84 see Figures 3 and 4 is welded between tire channels 72 and 74 at the centerline of pallet 46. Support member 84 connects tire channels 72 and 74 and provides support for the pallet structure 46. Fopr supplementary support members 86 to 89 Figures 3 and 4 are made of tubular steel and are also welded between tire channels 72 and 74, being spaced as shown.Supplementary support members 86 to 89 provide additional stability and strength to the pallet 46 and result in minimal deflection of pallet 46 while transporting automobiles. As further shown in Figures 2 and 3, each tire channel 72, 74 is provided with two safety grip treads 90 to 91 and 92 to 93. Strips 90 to 93 may be, for example, 16 GA Morton tread grip safety flooring strips. It will be appreciated that any rough textured material may be used in lieu of the safety grip strips here shown. Safety grip strips 90 to 93 are applied to the driving surface 76, 78 of tire channels 72, 74 so as to provide better tire traction while driving an automobile onto and off of pallet 46. Corrugated drip pan 94 is welded between tire channels 72 and 74 and is welded to support member 84 and supplementary support members 86 to 89. Drip pan 94 extends the entire length of tire channels 72 and 74.The corrugations of drip pan 94 prevent the fluid from running across the pallet 46 and spilling over the side of the pan 94 during movement. Drip pan 94 thus provides complete protection by preventing fluids from dripping upon other automobiles stored in the high rise rack structure 20 See Figure 1 . Drip pan 94 can be constructed from 22 GA corrugated sheet metal or other suitable corrugated material. Referring again to Figures 2 and 3, two angular steel tire blocks 96 to 97, 98 to 99 are mounted to each tire channel 72, 74. Tire blocks 96 to 99 form tire pockets 100, 101 into which the automobile tires are advanced. Tire pockets 100, 101 are positioned so as to prevent movement of the tires, thus retaining the automobile in proper alignment with respect to pallet 46 during transportation to and from the storage structure. Tire pockets 100, 101 may be positioned along the length of tire channels 72, 74 so as to accommodate any given size of tire and wheel base. For example, tire blocks 96 to 99 may be positioned so as to correspond to any of the sets of holes 102 to 105 seeFigure 3 , and thereafter bolted in place by bolts 107 to 108 see Figure 4 . In this way, pallet 46 may be adjusted to handle various automobile sizes. It will of course be appreciated that tire blocks 96 to 99 may be positioned and thereafter secured in place by any suitable method, as for example by placing the ends of the tire blocks in slots, or by welding the tire blocks once they are positioned . The manner of using the automobile transportation and storage pallet will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. An operator drives an automobile so that the tires are aligned with tire channels 72, 74 as the automobile approaches pallet 46.The automobile is then driven onto pallet 46 with the tires moving along tire channels 72, 74 with safety grip strips 90 to 93 providing better traction. The front tires of the automobile or back tires if the automobile is being backed in are then made to pass over the first of tire blocks 96 to 99 in tire channels 72 and 74 so that the tires settle into tire pockets 100, 101. The automobile is then stopped and the engine turned off, and tbe automobile is then ready to be transported on the pallet 46 by conveyors 52, 54 and S R machine 40 see Figure 1 and stored in the storage rack 20. Tire blocks 96 to 99 are repositioned in accordance with a given wheel base size and tire size and then bolted or otherwise secured in place prior to driving the automobile onto the pallet 46. In this way, tire pockets 100, 101 may be adjusted to fit any size of tire so as to prevent movement thereof and so as to ensure proper alignment of the automobile with respect to pallet 46. Once stored, drip pan 94 collects drippings from the automobile to prevent spillage upon other automobiles stored in the rack structure 20.
