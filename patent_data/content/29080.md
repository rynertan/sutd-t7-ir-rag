# Gate valve with position responsive interlock.

## Abstract
An gate valve 10 of the expanding type wherein a gate end segment assembly 34 having cooperative wedge surfaces 40, 42, 44, 46 are moved linearly be tween a pair of valve seats 24 to block the flow there between in one position and open the flow in another, the fluid flowing through aligned ports 82, 80 in the gate 36 and segment 38 in such open position. The im provement lies in substituting for prior art springs a guide rail 28 fixed to the valve housing or body 12 and ex tending parallel to the stroke of the movable members 34 , together with a rocker arm 54 pivotally mounted on one member 36 and having a slot 66 receiving a pin 58 out of the other 38 . A pair of lobes 84 extend from the opposed ends of the rocker arm 54 and contact the guide member 28 . When the gate and segment as sembly 34 are et any position between the ends of its stroke, the rocker arm 54 keeps both pairs of wedge sur faces 40, 42, 44, 46 tightly in contact, preventing any ex pansion. At either end position, one of the rocker lobes 64 enters a gap 30 in the guide rail 28 , permitting the rocker 54 to rotate and allowing wedging action be tween the two members 36, 38 to expand their overall thickness.

## Description
GATE VALVE WITH POSITION RESPONSIVE INTERLOCKField of the Invention The present invention concerns fluid flow valves generally, and is more particularly addressed to gate valves. Yet more particularly, the invention involves improvements to gate valves of the type wherein a pair of cooperating members which interface each other with two pairs of diverging wedge surfaces are movable linearly between a blocking position and an open flow position and provide sealing action against a pair of opposed valve seats in either position.Background of the Invention Gate valves of the sliding gate and segment type have been used extensively for many years, and from the beginning, the design engineer has faced this problem. At either end of the stroke of the pair of members, they must be expanded in thickness by stopping one member and pushing or pulling on the other to cause it to climb the wedging surface of the halted member, thus sealing against the valve seals.Between extremities, on the other hand, it is necessary to minimize the thickness of the sliding members so that they will not bind against the valve seats and jamb the gate and segment in a half and half position. Prior art solutions to this problem fall into two general categories, springs and centralizers. The former is exemplified in the U.S. Patent to unbar and Sanders, issued in 1960 as No. 2,954,960. This patent discloses the use of an ox yoke spring over a central pin in one member and having its ends tucked under a pair of opposed pins protruding from the other member. The spring forces the two members together so long as no opposed axial forces are exerted on the members. At the end of a stroke, when the floating segment member is halted by contact with a fixed stop member, an axial force exerted on the gate member through the control stem causes it to climb up the nowfixed segment member, thus expanding the assembly and causing it to seal against the opposed valve seats.It should be noted that with this type of assembly, the force applied to the gate member must first overcome the spring force. The centralizer type of structure is exemplified inU.S. Patent No. 2,583,512, issued to Laurent in 1952. Even a summary description of this structure would be too lengthy to set forth here, but it will be noted that the structure is complicated and includes a pair of fixed guides and a mechanical interlock between gate and segment. The latter includes a guide shoe which, during any sliding movement of the gate and segment, is constrained to travel in contact with both fixed guides in such position, the elements linked to the guide shoe force the gate and segment to stay in a central position in which they are pressed together with both pairs of inclined surfaces in tight contact. Summary of the Invention While springs and centralizers have done yeoman service, and indeed are still the standard of the industry, they do have disadvantages which the present inventor proposes to avoid. In the present invention1 springs are avoided and the number of interlocking parts are kept to a minimum. A single guide rail is secured to the housing adjacent one of the valve seats and extending parallel to the direction traveled by the gate assembly. This rail is provided with a single gap located for timely reception of a rocker member mounted on the moving assembly. The rocker is a simple plate member having the general shape of an isosceles triangle, the base having elongated in the stroke direction of the valve and disposed, in traveling position, generally parallel to the guide rail. Centrally of the base the rocker is pivotally secured to the nearer of the two gate sections and above this pivot, overlying the other member of the gate assembly, is a slot which receives a pin protruding from such member, the slot having a width to snugly receive the pin and being elongated in the direction between pivot point and the opposed apex of the triangular rocker arm. The triangular shape is modifield at the other two apices, at the opposed ends of the base, where a pair of lobes entend toward the guide rail and contact the same. The gap in the guide rail is located along its length to correspond to the end positions of the slidable gate assembly i.e., the lobe at one end of the rocker can enter the gap only when the segment member can move no further and additional force is exerted on the gate. This causes the rocker to pivot and permits the gate to slide on the wedge surface of the segment, expanding the thickness of the gate assembly and causing it to seal against the opposed seats. Between such extremities, both lobes of the rocker arm contact the guide rail and keep both pairs of wedge surfaces in tight contact, minimizing their overall thickness and preventing any drag against the valve seats. Short Description of the Drawing Figures The invention will probably be more readily comprehended by referring to the attached drawing forming a part of the present disclosure. In the drawing FIGURE 1 is a longitudinal section through the body of a gate valve embodying the invention, this view showing the positions of the parts during travel of the gate assembly between open and closed positions, or vice versa. FIGURE 2 is a longitudinal section like Figure 1, this view showing the positions of the parts in either open or closed position, after the gate assembly has been expanded to seal against the opposed valve seats. FIGURE 3 is an exploded isometric view showing the principal components of the assembly. Detailed Description of the Drawing Figures FIGURES 1 and 2 show a gate valve 10 comprising a housing 12 having a through passageway 14, 16 interrupted by an orthogonal interior valve chamber 18 which houses the gate mechanism of the valve. The two portions 14, 16.of the interrupted fluid passageway intersect the gate operating chamber 18 in opposed ports, respectively 20 and 22, which lie in opposed parallel planes and are there provided with seats. While various types of seats including metal to metal may be utilized, the drawing illustrates replaceable seats 24 secured in the indicated couterbores in the housing wall which defines ports 20 and 22. The conventional assembly includes a pair of seat.skirts 26 which surround the seats and are provided with a pair of inturned edge flanges 28 which serve as guides for the traveling gate assembly. In the present invention, one of the seat skirts is mddified and is designated 26 , the modification consisting of providing in the flanges or guard rails 28 a gap 30 which is disposed along the length of rail 28 at a preselected location enabling it to receive one of the lobes 64 of rocker arm 54, as discussed further below. It should be noted that the openings 32 in skirts 26 26 are of a diameter to receive the seats 24, which protrude from ports 20 and 22 through openings 32 so that the sealing contacts are between the flat surfaces 48 and 50 of the gate members and the planar outer ends 62 of the seats. These openings 32, of course, are aligned with possoqeways 82 and 80 in gate 36 and segment 38 when the latter are in their end position corresponding to an open valve. The two guard rails 28 and 28 of either skirt 26 or 26 extend lengthwise in the direction of travel of the gate assembly, of course, and are spaced from one another by the width of such assembly, plus a small operational clearance. FIGURE 1 shows the gate assembly 34, consisting of gate 36 and segment 38 in its traveling attitude, which. is the attitude it is designed and forced to assume in all positions of gate assembly 34 except at the opposed ends of its linear stroke. Such two positions, which can be designated sealed open and sealed closed, are the only two positions calling for wedging action between the gate 36 and segment 38. In all other positions, the divergent wedge surfaces 40 and 42 of gate 36 are in tight contact with the corresponding interfacing wedge surfaces 44 and 46 of segment 36, 40 with 44 and 42 with 46. It should be noted that there is no gap between either of these two pairs of contacting surfaces.In such attitude, it is apparent that the overall thickness of the assembly 34, measured along a perpendicular between the opposed and parallel flat outer surfaces 48 and 50 of segment 38 and gate 36, is at a mini mum. With such minimum thickness, there is an operational clearance between each sealing surface 48 and 50 and the sealing surfaces 62 of valve seats 24, insuring that the gate assembly 34 can be moved without bindiny. Such gapless contact between the diverging wedge surfaces 40 44 and 42 46 is insured by the disposition of the positioning device assembly 52, consisting of the rocker arm 54 and the pair of pins 56 and 58. The rocker arm 54 ïs basically a thin plate having the general form of an isosceles triangle with its base leg extending generally parallel to the guide rail 28 . At the opposed ends of this base leg, a pair of lobes 64 extend downwardly toward the guide rail, and in the traveling attitude of the assembly shown in FIGURE 1, these lobes 64 both contact the upper edge of the guide rail. The pin 56 extends through rocker arm 54 and is secured in an opening in the gate member 36. It servers as the pivot point for the rocker arm, and moves linearly with the rocker arm with each stroke. Rocker arm 54 thus has only one degree of freedom, rotation about pivot pin 56, and so long as both of its lobes 64 are in contact with guide rail 28 , even this one degree of freedom can not be exercised. The positioning device 52 is completed by the pin 58 secured in and extending from the side surface of segment 38 and through the slot 66 in rocker 54. Slot 66 has a width measured along the direction of the gate assembly to receive pin 58 in snug relationship but is elongated in the orthogonal direction, in the direction of fluid flow through the valve. In FIGURE 1, the gate assembly is being pushed toward the right end position by the stem 70, which is rigidly se cured to the gate 36, carrying seqment 38 with the assembly.Although the left hand lobe 64 is about to encounter the gap 30 in guide rail 28 , the entire assembly is free to move to the right in the figure until one member of the gate assembly encounters a stop. It is important to note that the positioning device is not self operating there is no rotation of the rocker arm 54 simply because a lobe 64 is in registry with the gap. Something further must occur before the rocker arm rotates it must be compelled to rotate. That further action is illustrated in FIGURE 2, which actually shows the positions of the parts at the end of two steps in a sealing sequence. First, the segment member 38 .oF the assembly hs of the assembly has contacted stop 72, which is part of the fixed housing 12, halting any further movement of this member to the right. Secondly, continued rightward thrust applied to gate member 36 through the stem 70 has caused it to move further to the right, further than segment 38. In so doing, wedge surface 40 of the gate pushes against wedge surface 44 of the segment and actually slides along it for a short distance. The segment 38 is lifted up, pushing it into sealing pontact with the upper seat 24,.and at the same time the gate member 36 is pushed into sealing contact with lower seat 24.A gap 74 is opened between wedge surfaces 42 and 46, the size of which gap is indicative of the increase in thickness of the gate assembly. Such expansion of the gate assembly is accompanied by a counter clockwise rotation of rocker 54, so that its left hand lobe 64 enters gap 30. Such rotation occurs because pivot pin 56 moves to the right relative to slot pin 58, the effect being the same as though pin 58 has moved to the left relative to pin 56. Pin 58 pushes to the left against the wall of slot 66, bringing about the rotation.It would seem that such pushing action would occur even if there were no slot 66, i.e., if this opening were circular, receiving pin 58 snugly on all sides. However, the opening must be slotted as shown to accommodote the movement of pin 58 upwardly as segment 38 is raised during the wedging action without the slot, such upward movement can not take place and the gate and segment members would remain locked in their traveling relationship. It is also important to note that, although it is necessary that the rocker arm rotate as described in order that the gate assembly expand its thickness and seal against the valve seats, the time when such expansion in thickness occurs is not dictated by the time when the lobe 64 arrives in the proximity of gap 30. The chain of events is initiated by the stopping of segment 38 by stop member 72, and then by the continued travel of gate 36. Thus, the precise location of gap 30 along guide rail 28 is not critical, and some manufacturing tolerance is permissible. Having read the description of one sealing sequence, the sequence of the reverse movement will be apparent to the reader. As the riçltward thrust through stem 70 is relaxed and a leftward pull is exerted through it on gate 36, the gate will move leftward a short distance to close gap 74.Such short motion will at the same time cause rocker arm 54 to rotate clockwise to its Figure 1 position, aided if necessary by the cam surface 76 at the left end of gap 30.This rotation will pull segment 38 and gate 36 back into their minimum thickness positions with both pairs of interfacing wedge surfaces in tight contact. The reverse stroke, leftward in. the figures, will be as depicted in Figure 1, and the sequence at the end of such stroke will be more or less a mirror image of that described.The wedging and expansion and sealing will be initiated when the left hand end of segment 38 strikes a fixed stop and further pull is applied to the gate member. A gap will be formed between wedge surfaces 40 and 44 as wedge surface 42 pushes against 46 and forces segment 38 into sealing position. This time the rocker arm 54 rotates clockwise, and the right hand lobe 64 enters the same gap 30. Again, the precise location of the gap is not critical. Having described a preferred embodiment, the present inventor wishes it to be known that he does not consider himself limited thereby. Many substantially similarmeans for accomplishing the same result in substantially the same manner will be apparent to those of average skill in the art, and such means are to be considered within the scope of the invention, which is to be judged only by the appended claims.
