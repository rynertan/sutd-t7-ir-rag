# Synchronization system for digital data.

## Abstract
A digital signal synchronization system including a digital signal source for supplying an input digital signal, and a plurality of substantially identical integrating circuits, each connected to the digital signal source for integrating the signal for a predetermined time. A plurality of clock sources are also provided, each connected to a corresponding one of the integrating circuits, so that each integrating circuit begins integrating the digital signal at a different time. Decision means are connected to the output of each of the integrating circuits for electing one of the integrating circuits according to a predetermined criteria.
