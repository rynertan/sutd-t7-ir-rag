## Description
ENDOSCORE FOCUS STATE DETECTORS The invention relates to endoscopes for visual observation or image recording, e.g. by an optical camera or television camera, wherein a focus state detector is provided so that an object to be observed or recorded is clearly formed, the focus state detector being provided to detect the instant when the image forming position of the objective lens of the optical system of the device is correctly focused, so as to form an accurately defined image on a predetermined surface, on which a film or the like is, arranged, the detector output being ur to indicate the focus state by a visual or audible signal, and possibly to initiate any necessary focus adjustment, or to trigger the making of a recording. With known focus state detectors, in cases where the object to be recorded or observed is dark, or if a dark field optical system is to be used, then generally the available detector output, given by a photoelectric transducer element will be so small that positive focus state detection will be virtually impossible. Therefore, means have been proposed to project a beam of a fixed form toward an object that is to be observed or recorded, as is disclosed in the gazette ofJapanese patent publication No. 19810 1974. However, as this requires an optical system independent of the image forming lens system, such means cannot be readily applied to endoscopes, wherein there is only a signal optical system light path available. Also, in detectors where a split prism is used, as is disclosed in the gazette of laid openJapanese patent No. 128923 1981, there are problems that.at least two very minute photoelectric transducer elements are required and, in order to obtain high precision, many photoelectric transducer elements will be required, so that the circuit system for comparing their output signals and detecting whether the focus state is correct or not will be complicated, and particularly when products are to be made in relatively small numbers, they will be very costly. A focus state detector with a plurality of photoelectric transducer elements using a diffracting plate is disclosed in the gazette of laid open Japanese patent No. 10131 1975. However, therein, as in the above described conventional example, the detector optical system is independent of the main optical system, so that such a device cannot be readily applied to an endoscope or the like in which there is only one optical system light path available. A focus state detector wherein a light source is periodically flickered to project successive spots of light onto an object to be recorded or observed, and the output signals obtained from the transducer during extinguished periods are deducted from the output signals obtained in the lighted intervals in order to reduce the influence of external light other than that of the light source and so provide focus state detection even if the object to be recorded or observed is dark, or a dark field optical system is to be used, is disclosed in the gazette of laid open Japanese patentNo. 125713 1981.However, in this known example, two separate positions conjugate with the predçtermined image forming surface are provided, one to each side of the image forming surface so that the light projected onto the object by the light projecting means arranged in one place may be received by the light receiving means arranged in the other place, and this has led to problems in that comparatively large spaces are required for the light projecting means and light receiving means, and the formations of the optical system and circuit system for focus state detection are complicated and costly. One object of the present invention is to provide an endoscope focus state detector capable of detecting the state of focusing with high precision, using a simple structure of low cost. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention there is provided an endoscope focus state detector for use in or with which an endoscope having an illuminating light source for transmitting illuminating light through a light guide to be projected onto an object that is to be observed or recorded via an optical system and light projected as a spot onto the object through an image forming lens of said optical system and reflected by said object to be received via said lens at a light sensor means having a photoelectric transducer surface arranged at or near a position optically conjugate with the predetermined image forming position of said optical system in order to detect whether the image of said object is in a correctly focused state with the image of the object clearly formed, characterised in that a focus state detecting aperture is formed in said light sensor means, a focus detection light source projects light through an aperture formed in or around said light sensor means, and means are provided to increase the signal to noise ratio by reducing or preventing illuminating light projected onto the object from influencing the output of said transducer.

embodiment and Figure 38 is a schematic explanatory view showing part of the optical system of a twenty second exemplary embodiment. The optical system of the first embodiment, shown in Figure 1 forms part of a focus state detector and setting device. A camera adapter 5, such as a photographic adapter to be interposed between an endoscope and a photographic camera, is removably fitted to the rear end of an eyepiece 3 of an endoscope 4 that has an elongate insertion sheath 1 extending from a hand grip part containing an observing objective optical system, a light guide entry port 2 being provided on the side of the hand grip. An image recording device, such as a photographic camera 6 or a television camera, can be removably fitted to the rear end of this camera adapter 5. The optical system of a focus state recording and setting device which moves a photographic lens automatically to set the correct focus position, using a focus state detector, is contained in the camera adapter 5. That is to say, an image forming lens 8, movable back and forth on an optical axis 7, as indicated by arrows, is arranged to the rear of the eyepiece lens system of the endoscope 4, aligned on the optical axis 7 when the endoscope 4 is fitted in place. A semisilvered focusing mirror 9 inclined for example, by 45 degrees to the optical axis 7 is arranged on the optical axis 7 to the rear of the lens 8. An image re forming lens 10, a photoelectric transducer element 11 as a light sensor means and a focus state or range finding light source 12 incorporating a periodic energising circuit are arranged in turn on a reflected optical axis, extending upward as drawn in Figure 1, on which light incident along the optical axis 7 is reflected by the mirror 9. A lamp lens 13 and a focus indicator lamp 14, which is energised to indicate correct focusing, are arranged in turn on a reflected optical axis extending downward as drawn in Figure 1, from the rear surface of the mirror 9. The photoelectric transducer element 11 forming the active component of the light sensor means, is in the form of a plate, which may be in the shape of a disc, a square, or rectangular form and is provided in a central roe with an aperture such as a pinhole or slit shaped rectangular hole 15 ,as shown in Figure 2.A I,lioto sensitive surface 17 is formed on the front surface of this disc by a layer in which the current chracteristics vaty with the level of light incident thereon, such as a PN junction surface forming a photodiode or photo transistor, or a layer of a material in which a photoelectromotive force is generated to form a solar battery, or a layer in which the resistance value varies, such as CdS.A light intercepting surface 18 is formed on the back face side of the plate so that the photoelectric transducer element 11 can not directly sense light from the source 12 as it is projected to detect focusing from the rear of the pinhole 15 on the reflected optical axis. A return mirror 21 is arranged inclined to the optical axis 7, for example, by 45 degrees, on the optical axis 7 to the rear of the mirror 9, in the camera 6 fitted to the rear of the camera adapter 5.A photographic film 22 is arranged in a predetermined image forming position to the rear of the return mirror 21. A penta prism 23, inverting and transposing right and left to return the image to an erect image, is arranged on a reflected optical axis, extending upward in the illustration, from the return mirror 21, and a finder lens 24 is arranged on an optical axis passing through this penta prism 23 so that the optical image formed on the film 22 can be observed by eye near to the rear of the finder lens 24. When taking a photograph, the return mirror 21 will be withdrawn so that the incident light may form an image on the film surface 22. The position of the photoelectric surface 17 of the photoelectric transducer element 11 is arranged to be optically conjugate with the position of the film surface 22. That is to say, it is so set that the light path length for light passing through the lens 8 forma an image on the film surface 22 to the rear, and the light path length for light reflected by the mirror 9 to pass through the image re forming lens 10 and form an image on the photoelectric surface 17 of the photoelectric transducer element 11 are equal to each other. The principle of the focus state detector contained in the camera adapter in this first embodiment, will be explained with reference to Figure 3 in which the optical axis of the detector system is simplified to be a linear optical system. In Figure 3, light is projected during energised periods of the light source 12, along the optical axis 7 through the aperture 15 of the photoelectric trans ducer element 11 to be projected through the lens 8 toward an object 25 that is to be photographed or otherwise observed or recorded. The light projected onto and reflected by the object 25 will return to the photoelectric transducer element 11 again, through the lens 8. Now, it will be assumed that the object 25 is in the position b when a clearly focussed image is obtained, and that the positions a and c are where the object is respectively nearer or farther than the position b . The light reflected in the position b will pass through the lens 8 to make a convergent point image forming poinL in the aperture 15, and therefore will not be incident upon the photosensitive surface 17 around the aperture 15. On the other hand, light reflected in the position a will be directed to be convergent at a point to the rear of the aperture 15 anJ will therefore strike the photosensitive surface 17 around the outer periphery of the aperture 15, a. illustrated by broken lines, and an electric signal corresponding to the surface area and light level W be emitted.In the same manner, the light reflected in the position c will be convergent at a point 1n front of the aperture 15, and will then expand to reach the photoelectric surface 17, and a corresponding electric signal will be emitted by the photoelectric transducer element 11. That is to say, the output level from the photoelectric transducer element 11 will be a minimum when the object 25 is in the correctly focused position, that is, the position b , and will increase as it is moved nearer or farther. In the above description, only the light projected in the energised periods of the light source has been considered. However, in fact, both during the energised periods and the intervening intervals of the flickering light source 12, there may be external light, such as the illuminating light fed through the light guide in the endoscope 4 as an illuminating light, for example, which is incident on the transducer, and therefore the output signal of the photoelectric element 11 will be partially obliterated by the output level of such external light. In the present embodiment, as shown inFigure 4, a periodically energised light source 12 is used as a means of projecting light onto the object 25, and the signal to noise ratio is increased by means which in this case detect the light levels and erase the influence of the external light. One input of a two input AND gate 31 serves as a control input to which a low or high level control signal A may be applied. The output of this AND gate 31 is connected to the input of a first mono stable stage 32 of a two stage multi vibrator. The output of of this stage is connected to energise a focus state detector light source 33. The inverted output of of the first stage 32 is connected to the input of a second stage 34, and the inverted output Q2 of the second stage 34 is connected to the other input of the AND gate 31. The operation of the thus formed light flickering circuit 12 to periodically energise the light source 33 will be explained in the following, with reference to the waveforms shown in Figure 5. If the control signal A remains at a low level, as shown at the time to, , the output of the AND gate 31 will be at the low level, and therefore the output Q1 of the first stage 32 will be at the low level, and the inverted output Q1 will be at a high level. Therefore, the output Q2 of the second stage 34 will be at the high level and the inverted output end Q3 Q2 will be at the low level. The output Q2 of the second stage 34 will remain at the high level only for the period T set by a capacitor and resistance not illustrated and then will be inverted to the low level. At the same time, the inverted output Q2 will rise to the high level and remain in this state. When the control A rises to the high level, at the time tl, the output 31 of the AND gate 31 will be at the high level, and therefore the output Q1 of the first stage 32 will move to the high level only for the set period T from the time tl to the time tl T , and therefore the light source 33 will be energised for this time period, and will then be extinguished when the output moves to the low level. With this movement, the inverted output Q1 of the first stage 32 moves from the low level to the high level, and therefore, the inverted output Q2 of the second stage will be at the low level after the set period T from the high level, just as the output Q1 of the first stage 32. When the inverted output Q2 of the second stage 34 is at the low level in the period T after the time tl T , the output of the AND gate 31 will be at the low level and the inverted output Q1 of the first stage 32 will be at the high level, and will be at the low level after this period T, that is, after tl 2T.After this time tl 2T, the control signal A will be in the state equivalent to the state after the time tl when it is at the high level, and the light source will continue to be periodically energised, alternately lit for a period T and then extinguished for a period T. Therefore, the output of the transducer resulting from reflected light projected intermittently, reflected by the object 25, and incident through the lens 8, will be as shown in Figure 6. The light level L0 existing due to external light, in the period when the light source 33 is extinguished, as shown in Figure 6 will make it hard to detect whether the focus state is correct or not. Therefore, in order to eliminate the influence of this accumulated light leakage level, a focus state detector circuit 35, as indicated in Figure 7, is provided. The output of the photoelectric transducer element 11 in the extinguished period is held by a sample hold circuit not illustrated and is deducted from the output of the photoelectric transducer element 11 in the energised period so that focus state detection is made only by the light projected onto the object 25 from the light source 33, uninfluenced by external light, and a high signal to noise ratio will be obtained. When the output value detected by the focus state detector 35 is minimum, a focus indicator 36 corresponding to the focus indicator lamp 14 in Figure 1 produces an output to indicate correct focusing, either by an optical or audible signal. When the lens 8 is not in a correctly focused position, a signal will be produced by a lens driving device 37, using a motor or the like to automatically set the lens 8 to a focused position. As a means of moving the lens 8 automatically to a focused position, for example, the lens 8 can be operated to move forward or back along the optical axis at a fixed velocity by the lens driving device.37, when triggered by the output of the focus state detector 35.If the output of the focus state detector 35 is fed in sequentially at proper intervals, the last entered signal value can be compared with the present signal value, and if the current signal value is larger than the last signal value, sensing signals will be put out to move the lens 8 in the reverse direction, and these will be integrated in an integrating circuit at a given time constant, or will be counted in a counting circuit so that when the resultant output rises above a fixed value, correct focusing may be indicated and the adjustment terminated. The operations of the thus formed focus state detector and focusing setting device used in this first exemplary embodiment will now be explained in greater detail. When a focus state detector button or the like not illustrated is pushed to place the control inputA of the light source control device 12 to a high level, this device 12 will periodically flicker the light source 33, and this intermittent light will pass through the aperture 15 and image re forming lens 10, be reflected by the mirror 9, pass on through the lr.ns 8 and endoscope 4 to be projected onto the object 25. The light reflected by the object 25 will pass back through the lens 8, be reflected by the focusing mirror 9 and proceed to the photoelectric transducer element 11 tt i is provided with the aperture 15. If the lens 8 is in the correct position for focusing the object 25, the output level of the photoelectric element 11 will be It a minimum.Therefore, in this case, in case the 1ei driving device 37 moves the lens 8 forward for exao and the output level will rise so that the advancin operation will be immediately stopped and a sensina signal put out to cause the lens driving device 37 t move the lens 8 in the reverse direction. Eventually, in this case too, the output level will begin to increase, and the sensing signal will again be put out to cause the lens 8 to be moved in the original direction again that is, forward . Thus, the lens 8 will vibrate minutely on the optical axis 7 when it reaches the focused position, and sensing signals will be put out frequently at short intervals.In this case, if the output is passed to an integrating circuit having a given time constant, or a counting circuit counting within a fixed period, when it rises above a fixed value the lens can be considered to be correctly focused, and this will be indicated, whilst further adjustment ceases. On the other hand, if the lens 8 deviates from the focused position and the lens driving device 37 initially moves the lens 8 in the direction away from the focused position, the output level of the photoelectric element 11 will gradually become larger, and therefore the focus state detector circuit 35 will control the lens driving device 37 to move the lens 8 in the reverse direction, as is described above. When the lens 8 passes the focused position, the same minute vibrating operation as is described above will be repeated, to set the lens 8 in the correctly focused position. When the lens 8 is thus set in the focused position, the focus indicating lamp 14 or the like will light, and an observer seeing this can make exposures on the camera. Thus a in this first exemplary embodiment of the present invention means are provided to increase the signal to noise ratio by arranging that the detector light source is flickered, and any external light reducing the precision of focus state detection is deducted so that its influence is substantially erased, and therefore it is possible to detect the state of focus with high precision, and to set the lens 8 in a precisely focused position. Further, according to this embodiment, the detector light projecting means and light sensor means can be made substantially integral, and therefore the focus state detector, or the complete focusing setting device, can be contained within a small space. Figure 9 shows a second exemplary embodiment of the invention, in which a focus setting device uses a modified embodiment of focus state detector. In this embodiment, instead of the electrical controlled light flickering device 12 which periodically energises the light source 33 in the first described embodiment, a rotating chopper 42 driven by a motor 41 is used, as shown in Figure 10, the light of the light source 33 being periodically intercepted so as to have the same timing function as the electrically flickered light source, and to so improve the signalto noise ratio. That is to say, as shown in Figure 10, a blade 43 and a rotary encoder 44 having holes in predetermined positions are fitted to respective ends of the shaft of the motor 41. When the motor 41 rotates, the blade 43 will periodically intercept the projected light beam from the light source 33, to prevent 5 reaching the aperture 15, so as to provide periods in which the light is projected onto the object 25, separated by intervals in which it is not projected.The rotary encoder 44 is so formed that a signal synchronised with the motion of the blade 43 to intercept the light may be taken from the output of a photointerrupter 45 arranged to embrace the rotary encoder 44. When the blade 43 is between the position of the light source 33 and the aperture 15 located in front of it, the light from a light emitting element in the photo interrupter 45 will be passed to a light receiving member through the related hole in the rotary encoder 44. Therefore, if the output of the photoelectric transducer element 11 at this time, which corresponds to a non projection interval, is stored, and then deducted from the output of the photoelectric transducer element 11 in the corresponding projection period the same control function as described for the first embodiment can be obtained. Instead of the shaped blade 43, an opaque disc can be used, provided with light transmissive apertures.The number of blades 43 or apertures, is not limited to two. The other formations are the same as in the first embodiment. Figure all shows a third exemplary embodiment, in which a focus setting device using a further modification of the focus state detector, in which the light sensor means and light projecting means are separated. In this embodiment, the light sensor is not formed by providing the photoelectric transducer element 11 of the above described embodiments with the aperture 15, which serves as a light projecting window, but separate light intercepting plates 51A and 51B are used, provides respectively with a focus detecting aperture 52A and light projecting aperture 52B. The light projecting means and light sensor parts are shown magnified in Figure 12. A beam splitter corresponding to a semi silvered mirror is formed by joining rectangular prisms 53A and 53B, and arranged on the reflected optical axis to the rear upward in the illustration of the image re forming lens 10. The light intercepting plates 51A and 51B provide the respective apertures 52A and 52B, and are bonded to the respective prism surfaces to be to the rear on the respective optical axes divided by these respective rectangular prisms 53A and 53B. A photoelectric transducer element 54 and the light source 33 with its associated chopper 42 are arranged respectively to the rear of the respective apertures 52A and 52B formed the respective optical axes. The aperture 52A is arranged in a position conjugate with the position of the film surface 22. The apertures 52A and 52B are formed with the optical axes passing through or reflected by the prisms 53A and 53B as respective centres in the light intercepting plates 51A and 51B, adjacent the photoelectric transducer element 54 and the light source 33 respectively. The light from the light source 33 passing through the aperture 52B will be periodically intercepted by the chopper 42, and will therefore be equivalent to an alternate flickering of the light source.33. The light passing through the aperture 52B will be reflected by the junction surface of the prisms 53B and 53A, to pass through the image re forming lens 10, be reflected by the mirror 9, pass through the lens 8 and be projected onto the object.A part of the light reflected by the object 25 will pass back through the lens 8, be reflected by the mirror 9, pass through the image re forming lens 10 and the prisms 52B and 52A, so that the amount can be measured at the photoelectric transducer element 54 arranged to the rear of the aperture 52A to detect the focus state. If focus is not correct, the lens 8 will be moved automatically to a focused state. As the light projected through the aperture 52B is periodically passed and intercepted by the chopper 42, the signal output obtained in the intervals corresponding to extinction of the light can be deducted from the signal output in the periods corresponding to light projection, as described above, to erase the influence of any external light and to increase the signal to noise ratio.This embodiment has a feature that no aperture need be formed in the photoelectric transducer element, as the aperture 52A is formed in the light intercepting plate 51A, which is easy to work. In this embodiment, the output of the photoelectric transducer element 54 will be at a maximum in the focused state. That is to say, when correctly focused, the image forming point convergent point of the light incident from the object 25 will be in the position of the pinhole aperture 52A, and therefore the light then passing through the aperture 52A will reach the surface of the photoelectric transducer element 54. On the other hand, when unfocused, the image forming point will be in a position to the front or rear of the aperture 52A and therefore the amount of light reaching the photoelectric transducer element 54 will reduce. Therefore, as described above, when in the focused state, the output of the photoelectric transducer element 54 will be maximum. The other parts are the same as in the second embodiment, shown in Figures 9 and 10. The light projected onto the object 25 will flicker in a similar manner, and the influence of external light erased in the same way as is described above. In a modification the light source 33 may be flickered electrically, using the two mono stable stages 32 and 34 as a multi vibrator, as in the first embodiment, for example, instead of the mechanical chopper 42 or its like. The second and third embodiments can be formed without using the photo interrupter 45. For example, reflecting and non reflecting parts may be provided on a rotary disc fitted to the motor 41, so that light emitted from a light emitting element reflector is projected onto the rotary plate and light reflected by any reflecting part received by a light sensing element to detect the period and timing of the flickering. In the third embodiment, a semi silvered mirror may be used instead of the prisms 53A and 53B. Further, it is needless to say that the aperture 15 formed in the photoelectric transducer element 11, or the apertures 52A and 53B in the light intercepting plates 51A and 51B may be openings of any shape, and may be openings closed with transparent window members. An example of an electrical circuit for flickering the light source 33 is shown in Figure 4, but other timing circuits can be used. For example, if the light source 33 is flickered by applying the output of an oscillator of a predetermined frequency, and the output of the light sensor means, that is to say the output of the photoelectric transducer element 11 or 54 selectively amplified to enforce only the related frequency component, the influence of external light can be substantially erased. By the way, in the above described respective embodiments, the focus state detector and focus setting device are contained in the camera adapter to be fitted to the endoscope 4 as shown. However, it is the focus state detector and focus setting device which can be applied to any other optical devices for clearly forming the optical image of the object on a predetermined image forming surface. Further, in the first and second embodiments, or in any of the embodiments to be described which employ an aperture 15 in the photoelectric transducer element 11, if a light intercepting film is formed on the side wall to prevent any radial light leakage to the photosensitive surface 17, the dark current component will be further reduced and the focus state can be detected with a higher precision. In the focus state detectors described above, the state of focus is detected by measuring the amount of the incident flickered light returned from the object, using a photoelectric transducer element having an aperture formed therein, or one arranged to the rear of an aperture acting as a selective window, there are advantages that, with a simple formation, the influence of the external light can be substantially erased and the focusing can be detected with high precision, and as the detector light projecting means and light sensor means can be substantially integrated or arranged adjacent each other, comparatively little space will be required, and the device can be realised at a low cost. A fourth exemplary embodiment will now be described with reference to Figures 13 to 16, in which a focus setting device uses a focus state detector as shown in Figure 13. A flexible light guide cable 59 is connected tc the light guide entry port 2 of the endoscope 4 to be inserted introduced into an abdominal wall 58 or the like so as to supply an illuminating diagnostic light from an external light source 60. The electric power for the light source 60 is fed via an electric power supply cord 62, provided with a connector plug 61, to a transformer 63 contained within the light source 60, and provides a control circuit 64 with an alternating electric power supply of a predetermined voltage. The above mentioned electric power supply cord 62 is so connected that control of the electric power supply is available by operation of an electric switch 66 through a cord 65 within the light source 60, to give on or off control. The control circuit 64 is provided with a light source flickering circuit 68 for periodically energising the illuminating lamp 67 in the light source 60. During the intervals in which this light source flickering circuit 68 extinguishes the light, the control circuit 64 will feed electric power to the focus state detector light source 33 in the adapter 5 through a signal cable not illustrated to directly energise the light source 33 or transmit a control signal through the signal cable to cause the light source 33 to be energised by a battery or the like within the adapter 5. The light from the lamp 67 within the light source 60 is projected onto the end face 70A of a light guide cable 59 fitted to a connector 69 provided on the outer periphery of the light source 60 in a position facing the lamp 67, the guide cable 59 being held in the connector 69 by a connector 70. Incident light is transmitted to the light guide entry port 2 of the endoscope through the light guide cable 59, and will be projected onto an object 25 in front of the insertion sheath 1 through light transmitting means within the endoscope 4. The light source flickering circuit 68 contained within the above mentioned light source 60 is formed as shown, for example, in Figure 14, which resembles the circuit 12 shown in Figure 4, the illuminating lamp 67 being flickered by the inverted output Q of the first stage 32. The illuminating lamp 67 will be extinguished in the periods when the focus state detector light source 33 lights, and be lit up in the intervals when the detector light source 33 is extinguished. As shown in Figure 15, when the light source flickering circuit 68 causes the detector light source 33 to be energised, the output detected by the photoelectric transducer element 11 will control the focus state detector 35 to operate to judge the focusing state, and if correctly focused, the focus indicator 36, corresponding to the lamp 14 or the like in Figure 14 will indicate this by emitting the required signal, and if the image is not focused, as required when the lens driving device 37 will be operated to move the lens 8 to set the correct focus state. In the focus state detector 35, action is inhibited when the light source 33 is extinguished, by short circuiting the input so that no false focus state will be detected. The operation of the focus setting device in this embodiment will now be explained in detail. If the switch 66 is set to its on position, and the electric power supply plug 61 is connected to a supply socket of an electrical power source, the power will be applied. In this state, the illuminating light source will be maintained constant so that the object 25 to be observed or recorded can be carefully studied. Before making an exposure to record an image of the object in the camera 6, the control signal A will be elevated to a high level, by the operation of a switch, for example. The illuminating light source lamp 67 will then flicker periodically under the control of the light source flickering circuit 68. When this lamp 67 is extinguished, the focus state detector light source 33 will be illuminated, so that its light will pass through the aperture 15 to be reflected by the focusing mirror 9 and be projected as a spot onto the object 25 through the lens 8 and the observing optical system of the endoscope 4. The light reflected by the object 25 will be received back at the photo sensitive surface 17 of the photoelectric transducer element 11, to produce an output signal corresponding to the received light, and so indicate the state of focus.When the detector output signal is at or below a level corresponding to dark current, the image can be judged as correctly focused, and this will be indicated by the focus indicator 36. If the image is not focused as required, then the driving device 36 will be operated to move the lens 14 forward and or rearward, to set it in the correct focus position. This procedure is shown graphically in Figure 16.During each period H, the illuminating lamp 67 is energised and the photoelectric transducer element 11 held inoperative, and during each interval L the lamp 67 is extinguished, and the photoelectric transducer element 11 and focus state detector circuit 35 operate normally. If the detector output level of the photoelectric transducer element 11 is larger than the dark current level 10 substantially zero , the focus state detector 35 will operate the lens driving device 37 to move the lens 8 forward or rearward. In this case, if the lens 8 is initially moved in the direction away from the correct focus position, the sensing signal il will be emitted immediately and the lens driving device 37 will be reversed, to drive the lens in the direction to approach correct focus.When the lens 8 has been moved to bring the output level of the photoelectric transducer element 11 to or below the dark current level or focusing level Io, the focus state detector 35 will stop the operation of the lens driving device 37 and the indicator 36 will indicate that the image is correctly focused. Therefore, if the object is photographed or exposed to a television camera in this state, a clear recorded image will be obtained. In the above described fourth embodiment, while the focus state is being detected the lamp 67 is extinguished to avoid introducing a noise component, and the focus state can be detected precisely without being influenced by the external light that is, while making the signal to noise ratio is increased and focus state detection can be efficiently carried out, even with a feeble focus detector light source. Further, with a focus state detector of such high precision, the lens can be automatically set at a focus point with equally high precision. As the lighting period is provided by flickering the illuminating lamp 67, the observer can maintain observation. If this flickering rate is made sufficiently high, the observer will be able to observe without any distraction due to the flickering. Instead of providing for automatic setting of the lens 8, as mentioned above, the lens 8 may be manually moved to the correct focus. The lens driving device 37 is shown in Figure 16 to be continuously operated, even during the period when the illuminating lamp 67 is lighted, but it may be designed so as to be operated only during the lamp extinguished periods. The focus state detector light source 33 may remain energised during the periods when the illuminating light source lamp 67 is energised. In the above described fourth embodiment, the focus state is detected by using a comparator, but it may be detected by the method described with reference to the earlier embodiments. Figure 17 shows a fifth exemplary embodiment, wherein the illuminating light beam is mechanically chopped to provide and periods in which light is projected and intervals in which no light is projected. In this embodiment, instead of electrically flickering the lamp 67 by the light source flickering circuit 68, as described for the fourth embodiment, a mechanical chopper 42 of the type described with reference to Figure 10, may be used, as shown in magnified detail in Figure 18. The blade 43 intercepts the path between the light source 67 and the end face 70A of a connector 70 in the time intervals when the light from the light emitting element of the photo interrupter 45 is fed to the light receiving element thereof through a hole in the rotary encoder 44, and the resultant signal in the interval corresponding to this extinguishing will be transmitted to a flickering control circuit 68 via a pair of conductors in the supply cable interconnecting the control circuit, supply, motor and photo interrupter. In the flickering control circuit 68 , the light of the focus state detector light source 33 is projected onto the object 25 when this resultant signal is received, and light reflected by the object 25 will be received by the light sensor element 11 to detect the state of focus. The other formations are substantially the same as in the above described fourth embodiment. Figure 19 shows the essential modifications to form a sixth embodiment, wherein different focus state detector means are used in place of the light projecting means and light receiving means shown in Figure 17. This sixth embodiment uses an optical arrangement that is substantially the same as that shown in Figure 12, relating to the third embodiment described. The detector light source 33 will be electrically flickered in synchronism with the chopper 42. The detector light source need not be flickered, provided that the focus state is only sensed during the periods in which the illuminating light 67 is intercepted, as the same effective improvement in signal to noise ratio will be obtained. Figure 20 shows the essential modification for a seventh embodiment, using a different light receiving and projecting means from those described above for focus state detection. On the optical axis to the rear of the image reforming lens 10 arranged on the optical axis reflected by the focusing mirror 9, two light sensor elements 72B and 72A having respective photo sensitive layers 71B and 71A are arranged on the right and left sides of the optical axis, slightly separated from each other. Light intercepting plates 73A and 73B are secured by a bonding agent or the like to the rear faces of the respective photo sensitive layers 71A and 71B of substantially the same shape to form the respective light sensor elements 72A and 72B. Alternatively a light intercepting substance may be applied to the rear faces of the layers. The light path lengths from the object 25 to the respective photo sensitive layers 71A and 71B of the light sensor elements 72A and 72B are equal, but a transparent member 74, such as an optical glass or a transparent paint is applied to or arranged in front of the front face of the photo sensitive layer 71A of one light sensor element 72A, so that the effective light path length including this transparent member 74 is slightly larger than the light path length to the photosensitive layer 71B of the light sensor element 72B, which is not provided with a transparent member 74. The intermediate position between the resultant light path lengths to these two photosensitive layers 71A and 71B is set to be conjugate with the film surface 22. The outputs of the respective light sensor elements 72A and 72B are so formed that the state of focus can be determined by a comparator or the like. The outputs of the respective light sensor elements, 72A and 72B are connected to the two respective inputs of two separate comparators, 75 and 76, each formed by a differential amplifier or the like. The respective connections are made via individual resistances, 75A, 75B and 76A, 76B, and the respective outputs of both comparators, 75 and 76, are connected to respective inputs of a two input exclusive OR gate 77. The respective resistances 75A and 76A are connected to the respective inverting inputs of the respective comparators 75 and 76, while the respective resistances 75B and 76B are respectively connected to the non inverted inputs. The focus state indicating lamp 14 is connected to the output of the exclusiveOR gate 77. The respective outputs of the light sensor elements 72A and 72B are earthed through respective resistances, 78A and 7813. For example, in case the respective photosensitive layers 71A and 71B containPN junctions, formed between a P type semiconductor and N type semiconductor, the respective photosensitive layers 71A and 71B will be biased in the reverse direction between the outputs and earth, so that normally there will be no significant photoelectric current flow. The resistances 75A, 75B and 76A, 76B connected to the respective inputs of the comparators 75 and 76 are preferably so selected that the resistance values of two, for example R7SA and R75B, are substantially equal to each other, although the resistance value R 75A may be slightly larger than R 75B and the other resistances 76A and 76B are selected in opposite manner, the resistance value R76A being slightly smaller than R 76B The threshold values compared and detected by the respective comparators 75 and 76 are thus slightly different from each other. That is to say, only in the range between the two threshold values corresponding to the range considered to be in the correctly focused state, in which the light incident upon each of the light sensor elements, 72A and 72B, is of equal magnitude, then when the output of one of the comparators 75 and 76 is at the high level or positive , the output of the other comparator will be at the low level or negative . Therefore, only in this case will the output of the exclusive OR gate 77 be at the high level and the focus indicating lamp 14 energised.Instead of R 75A R 75B and R76A R76B the values may be so selected that R75A R75B and R76A R76B or R75A R75B and R76A R76B or R75A R75B and R7C R76B Or R75A R 75B and R76A to operate in substantially the same manner. The focus state detector operation in the thus formed seventh embodiment is as follows. First of all, when in the correctly focused state the reflected light returned from the object will pass through the aperture between the two light sensor elements 72A and 72B, and will not be incident upon the photosensitive layers 71A and 71B. Therefore, the photoelectric currents from the respective light sensor elements 72A and 72B will both be substantially zero. Therefore, the output levels of the respective comparators 75 and 76 will be between both threshold values. The output of the comparator 75 will be at the high level, the output of the comparator 76 will be at the low level, and the output of the exclusiveOR gate 77 will be at the high level to light the lamp 14. Therefore, the observer will know that the image is in the correctly focused state. On the other hand, in the rear focus state when the image is focused to the remote side of the actual object that is to be recorded, the convergent point of the reflected light will be in front of both light sensor elements 72A and 72B, and the light will expand rearwardly from this point, so that in this case, the light incident upon the photosensitive layer 71A of the light sensor element 72A set to the longer light path length, will be larger in magnitude than that incident on the other, and the output of the light sensor element 72A will be larger than that of the other. Therefore, in both light sensor elements 72A and 72B, a photoelectric current larger than the dark current will flow. However, as the output of the light sensor element 72A is larger, as mentioned above, the outputs of both comparators 75 and 76 will be at the low level, and the output of the exclusive OR gate 77 will be at the low level, so the lamp 14 will not be energised. In the same manner, in the front focus state where the optical system including the lens 8 is focused to a plane nearer than the position of the actual object that is to be recorded, the convergent point of the reflected light will be to the rear of both photosensitive layers 71A and 71B, and therefore in this case the light incident on the photosensitive layer 71B, to which the effective light path length is slightly shorter, will be slightly larger, and the output level of the light sensor element 72B will be larger than that of the other. Therefore, the output levels of both comparators, 75 and 76, will be at the high level, the output of the exclusive OR gate 77 will be at the low level, and the lamp 14 will not be energised. Thus, the focus state of the objective lens 8 can be detected. As opposed to the fourth and fifth embodiments wherein, in order to indicate the time of the focused state, the reference level of the comparator must be set to the value of the dark current, or the sixth embodiment, wherein it must be set at the maximum value corresponding to the correctly focused state, with an arrangement as proposed for this seventh embodiment, there is an advantage that there will be no influence of the dark current, and the state of focus can be detected without the need of adjusting the maximum value level corresponding to the correctly focused state with the distance, as in the case of the sixth embodiment. Further, in the non focused state, the direction in which the lens is deviated can be easily distinguished by checking the outputs of the two comparators, and therefore the correctly focused state can be readily set by suitably driving the lens driving device 37. Figure 22 shows the arrangement of a photographic device in an eighth exemplary embodiment of the present invention, wherein a periodically moving object 25 such as a heart, is to be photographed, exposure being made automatically at the instant when a correctly focused state is reached. Within an adapter 5 a beam splitter 9 , formed by joining two rectangular prisms 9A and 9B by their inclined surfaces, is arranged to the rear of the lens 8 movable for a distance x, and a further light measuring beam splitter 81 is arranged adjacent but to the rear of the beam splitter 9 . A light measuring lens 82 and light measuring photoelectric transducer element 83 are arranged in sequence to the rear of this beam splitter 81 on the reflected optical axis. In the adapter 5 a signal can be transmitted to the camera 6 through a signal cable 86 connected to a connector 85, respective functions shown in Figure 23 being controlled through the signal cable 86, e.g. by pushing a release button 87 provided on the upper side of the camera 6 to operate a control circuit 88. This control circuit 88 is electrically connected via a cable 90 extending between a connector 89 on the adapter 5 and a connector 91 on the light source 60, so that, during the focus state detector operation, a signal may be fed from the light source 60, the illuminating and diagnostic light intercepted by a shielding plate 92, and the precision of the focus state detection thus improved. A control circuit 64 contained in the light source 60 is formed of an exposure preventing means operating a plunger 93, for example, when a signal of a high level is transmitted during the focus state detection operation, to rotate the shielding plate 92 to the position indicated by the broken line and prevent the illuminating light from the lamp 67 from reaching the tip 70A of the connector 70 of the light guide cable 59. In this embodiment, a reflecting mirror 23 is used in the camera 6 instead of the penta prism 23. The control circuit 88 operated by pushing the release button 87 provided on the camera 6 is so formed as to control respective functions shown in the block schematic circuit diagram shown in Figure 23. If the button 87 of an exposure release 94 is pushed, the control circuit 88 will be operated, and a release signal a having the waveform as shown inFigure 24a will be emitted to put the release 94 into a stand by state 94 . When this signal a is at a high level, if a driving signal to be described is applied at a predetermined time, the release 94 will be able to open the shutter 95 of the camera 6.The signal a is transmitted to the light source 60 through the cable 90, and if the signal a is at the high level, for example, the control circuit 64 within the light source 60 will operate the plunger 93 with a plunger operating signal b having the waveform shown in Figure 24b, to rotate the shielding plate 92 to be in the state shown by the broken line, and block the illuminating and diagnostic lamp 67, whilst leaving a stroboscope unshielded.When in this state, the focus state detector light source 33 will be energised, this light will pass through the aperture 15 and be reflected by the beam splitter 9 to be projected via objective lens 8 and the observing optical system of the endoscope 4 onto the object 25 that is to be photographed, such as an internal organ, and will be received back at the photoelectric transducer element 11 in which the aperture 15 is formed.When the transducer signal output c shown in Figure 24c reaches the minimum value, the control circuit 88 will emit a minimum value detecting signal d and as shown in Figure 24d, only at the time of the first minimum value, for a predetermined period el a pulse sequence f will be emitted as shown in Figure 24f, so that a focus indicating means 96 such as a light emitting diode or the like, positioned within the camera viewfinder field of view is energised or an audible announcing means such as a buzzer will be operated. Once it is indicated that the periodic movement of the object that is to be recorded is moving into a correctly focused position during its cyclic movement, the next time the object moves with the heart or breathing and is once more correctly focused, a driving signal g Figure 24g will be emitted to the stand by release 94 and stroboscopic light 97 within the light source 60 will be triggered to emit a pulse of light having the waveform shown by Figure 24h, the light of this stroboscope 97 being projected onto the object 25 through the light guide cable 59 to form an exposure on the camera film.When the detected light or exposure amount measured by the photoelectric transducer element 83 within the adapter 5 indicates an adequate exposure level, an exposure terminating stopping signal i Figure 24i will be emitted for a predetermined period to end the stroboscope 97 lighting time. When the above mentioned exposure terminating signal i is at the low level or is not emitted , the shutter 95 will close and the release 94 will return to its normal rest state. The operation of the thus formed eighth embodiment will now be explained in greater detail. The operator manually sets the photographic objective lens 8 in advance, for example, at the nearest point at which an image of the object 25 can be clearly formed, or in any other position in which the object is required to be photographed. When the release button 87 is depressed the shutter 95 within the camera 6 does not immediately open, but the release signal a shown in Figure 24 is emitted and the release 94 set to a stand by state 94 , whilst the output signal c from the photoelectric transducer element 11 will be fed into the control circuit 88 to detect the state of focus at any instant. In this case, the object 25 is moving forward and rearward, and the output signal c will vary cyclically as shown in Figure 24. At the time of each minimum value the control circuit 88 will emit a minimum value signal d . While this focus state detection is being made, the control circuit 88 will transmit the signal to the light source device 60 through the cable 90 and the plunger 93 will be operated to block the observing illuminating light so that the signal to noise ratio for focus state detection is improved. When the first minimum value detecting signal 1d is emitted during a predetermined period, indicating means 96 light a lamp or energise a buzzer for the period e , to show that the correct focus state is present in each cycle with the manually set position of the lens 8, so that a clear photographic image can be obtained. When this indicator means 96 has operated for the set predetermined period e then when the next minimum value detecting signal d is emitted, the shutter 95 will open, the return mirror 21 will retreat, by rotating or the like, and the strobe 97 will emit a light pulse as shown by the waveform h in Figure 24. In this case, the amount of the light received from the object 25 from the strobe 97 will be measured by the photoelectric transducer element 83 within the adapter 5.When a proper exposure time is reached, the exposure terminating signal i will be automatically emitted to stop the light emission from the strobe 97. When this exposure terminating signal i ceases, the shutter 95 will close and the release 94 will be set back to its initial state, so that a further photographic exposure operation will be possible. This eighth embodiment has many advantages, as the work of the lens driving system is replaced by a manual operation, the drive can be omitted and the device made light and small, whilst a well focused photograph of high reliability can be achieved.Furthermore, a photograph of the object having no lack of focus can be taken at a proper timing after the existance of a correct state of focus is confirmed. As the shutter 95 automatically opens at a desired timing after focusing, there need be no hand displacement in the direction at right angles to the optical axis.Finally, as the lens driving system is rendered unnecessary, the device can be cheap to manufacture. Figure 25 shows a modified photographic device forming a ninth exemplary embodiment, wherein light from the illuminating lamp 67 within the light source 60 is used both for photographic exposure and focus state detection. A rotatable mirror 101 that can be withdrawn from the blocking position shown by the solid line is arranged, inclined for example by 45 degrees to the rear of the aperture 15 of the photoelectric transducer element 11 and a light guide entry port 102 is formed on the outer periphery of the adapter 5 to the rear of the mirror 101, so that the light guide cable 59 transmits illuminating light from the lamp 67 contained in the external light source 60. The illuminating light transmitted via this light guide entry port 102 will be reflected by the mirror 101 on to an end face of a light guide cable 103 fitted by a connector not illustrated to be positioned with its end face in the adapter 5 on the optical axis from the mirror 101. The other end of the cable 103 is fitted to the light guide entry port 2 of the endoscope 4. The illuminating light from the lamp 67 will be fed to the mirror 101 within the adapter 5 through the light guide cable 59 and fed to the end face of the light guide cable 103. The mirror 101 can be rotated to be withdrawn from the blocking position shown by the solid line, to the focus state detection position shown by the broken lines, by operation of a plunger 93 that is controlled by the control circuit 88 contained within the adapter 5. When it is rotated and so withdrawn, the illuminating light transmitted and fed to the light guide entry port 102 will pass directly on through the aperture 15 from the back of the light receiving transducer element 11 to function as a light source for focus state detection, no light being fed to the cable 103. A connector 104 and mating socket are provided respectively on the rear of the adapter 5 and the front of the camera 6, so that when the release button not illustrated is depressed, a signal can be transmitted to the control circuit 88 in the adapter 5 from the camera 6. Further, the adapter 5 and light source 60 can transmit the signal through a cable 106 connected via a socket 105 formed on the outer periphery of the adapter 5 so that the lamp 67 can be controlled by the control circuit 88. The cable 106 can also serve as the power supply cable. The timing chart of the control circuit 88 in this ninth embodiment is substantially as that shown in Figure 24, except that the wave form b is as shown by a broken line. In this embodiment, the plunger operating signal b will operate while the focus state is being detected. The other parts are the same. The thus formed ninth embodiment is set as described above. When the release button is depressed, the shutter 95 not illustrated of the camera 6 will not open, but the release signal a shown in Figure 24 will be emitted, the release 94 will be set to a stand by state and the plunger 93 will be operated to rotate and withdraw the mirror 101 to the position shown by broken lines from the position shown by solid lines in Figure 25. Then, the illuminating and diagnostic light from the lamp 67 transmitted via the guide 59 to the connector 102 will pass through the aperture 15 formed in the photoelectric transducer element 11, and will be projected as a spot onto the object 25.The output signal 5c of the photoelectric transducer element 11 receiving reflected light from a cyclically moving object 25 will be fed to the control circuit 88 to detect the state of focus. In this case, as the object 25 moves forward and rearward the output signal c will vary periodically as shown in Figure 24.At the time of each minimum value, the control circuit 88 will emit a minimum value detecting signal sod . In this case, in normal use the illuminating and diagnostic light is intercepted and not used for focus state detection, but all the light is available to be utilised for focus state detection, when required.Therefore, the object can be well illuminated by a spot with adequate intensity and focus state detection can be effected with high precision. When the first minimum value detecting signal d is emitted, during a fixed period, the indicator means 96 light a lamp or energise an audible signal such as a buzzer for the period e in Figure 24, the lamp lighting or buzzer sounding being effected by a sequence of pulses f to indicate that correct focus has been present with the manually set position of the lens 8, and that a photographic exposure to give a clear image is possible. When this indicator means 96 has operated for the set period e , then at the next instant that a minimum value detecting signal d is emitted or when the minimum value detecting signal d is next emitted after a given fixed period , the stand by release 94 will be triggered, the shutter 95 will open, the return mirror 21 will retreat, and an optical image of the object 25 will be formed on the film surface 22. At the same time, the plunger 93 will return to its original state and the strobe 97 will emit a light pulse h as shown in Figure 24.This light pulse will be reflected by the mirror 101 to illuminate the object 25 via the light cable 103 and the illuminating optical system of the endoscope 4. In this case, the magnitude of light received from the object 25 following the exposure pulse of the strobe 97 will be measured by the photoelectric transducer element 83 within the adapter 5. When a correct exposure level is reached, the exposure terminating signal i will be automatically emitted to stop light emission by the strobe 97, and when this signal i ceases the shutter 95 will close and the stand by release 94 will return to its initial rest state so that a further photographic exposure operation is possible. The effects of the correctly focused exposure photography device formed with the ninth embodiment are substantially the same as for the eighth emb.odiment As the illuminating diagnostic light from outside the adapter 5 is utilised for focus state detection, a light level of sufficient intensity can readily be projected, and the focus state can be detected with high precision, even in a dark field optical system. The beam splitters 9 and 81 shown in the eighth and ninth embodiments can be replaced by semi silvered mirrors. Also, in the eighth and ninth embodiments, as the lens 8 is set in advance, and the release button 97 then depressed to obtain a signal when the object 25 that is to be recorded moves to reach the correct focus point, as confirmed by the indicator means 96, the object 25 will be photographed when it next reaches the correct focus point. In case the moving distance of the object 25 relative to the lens 8 is small, or the object is substantially stationary, if the release button 87 is initially depressed and then the lens 8 is moved until a correct focused point is reached, the indicator means 96 will then operate in this case, the focus state detector signal c will be as shown by way of example by broken lines in Figure 24 .Therefore, the lens 8 can be finely adjusted to set the correctly focused point and the stand by release 94 can be operated to open the shutter 95 and to make the strobe 97 emit a light pulse so that the object may be photographed with a proper exposure amount. The indicator means 96 can be operated to make successive photographic exposures of the object. The indicator means 96 are not essential, and the shutter 95 may be opened to photograph the object as soon as the correct focus state is reached. As described above, when the lens is manually set and an exposure initiated by depressing the release button, then the possibility of making a correctly focused exposure will be confirmed by the indicator means and, in cases where photography is possible, if the correctly focused state is achieved made after a given time interval1 the photograph will be made automatically with a proper exposure.Therefore, the effects of hand shake can be avoided, and will not vibrate the camera during the exposure. Figure 26 shows a tenth embodiment, in which a filter 111 selectively stopping light of a specific wave length is movably interposed between the illuminating lamp 67 fitted to a lamp base 67 arranged within the light source 60 and the end face 70A of the connector 70 on which the illuminating and diagnostic light from the lamp 67 is projected. A control knob 114 is fitted on the outside end of a shaft 113 rotatably fitted in a receiver 112 tormed on the outer periphery of the light source 60. When the control knob 114 is rotated, a light intercepting plate 115 fitted on the inner end of the shaft 113 will be rotated together with the filter 111, which is fixed in an aperture formed in the light intercepting plate 115 positioned between the lamp 67 and the end face 70A of the connector 70, to withdraw the filter 111 from the illustrated position and allow illuminating light to be projected directly onto the end face 70A of the connector 70 without being passed through the filter 111. A filter 117 passing only the specific wave length stopped by the filter 111, for example, a wave length corresponding to a colour not found within the human body, such as green, is arranged in front of the photoelectric transducer element 11 within the adapter 5, so that the light of the focus state detector light source 33 projected onto the object 25 by passing will only contain the specific wave length passed by the filter 117, whereas the observing diagnostic illuminating light will not contain this specific wave length, which is stopped by the filter 111. The output of the light sensor transducer element 11 is judged by a focus state detector comparator to determine whether the image is clearly focused or not. For example, when the output of the photoelectric transducer element 11 is fed to one input of the comparator and the other input is set at a reference level corresponding to the dark current level minimum value level , then a decision whether a focused state exists or not can be detected by determining whether the polarity of the output of the comparator will be reversed or not. In such cases, a buzzer may be operated or a visual indicator such as a LED, lamp or the like may be energised within the view finder field. According to this tenth embodiment, both observation and focus state detection can be made when set in the state shown in Figure 26. That is to say, as the object 25 is illuminated by the illuminating light from the lamp 67 with the specific wave length used for focus state detection stopped out by the filter 111, the observer can still observe and study the object 25.In this case, as the light of the focus state detecting light source 33 is of the above mentioned wave length, selected by the filter 117, and is projected as a spot onto the object 25 through the lens 8, and the light of the specific wave length reflected by the object 25 is selectively received by the photoelectric transducer element 11, when the lens 8 is moved to reach the correct focus state the output level of the photoelectric transducer element 11 will drop to the dark current level, and therefore the correct focus state can be detected. In this focus state detection, as the light source 33 used for detecting the focus state only contains light of the specific wave length selected by the filter 117, and this light is projected onto the object 25, and any light of this wavelength has been stopped out of the illuminating light from the lamp 67 by the filter 111, it is possible to achieve focus state detection with high precision, uninfluenced by external light deviated from near the axis to be a noise component in the focus state detector. As only the light of the specific wave length is stopped out from the illuminating light, observation can be made without trouble. When in the correct focus state, if a release button not illustrated is depressed, the shutter will open and the automatic exposing mechanism of the camera 6 will operate. When the exposure level becomes proper the shutter will close and the photograph will have been taken. The filter 117 may be arranged in front of the lens 8. Figure 27 shows an eleventh embodiment of the present invention, in which the focus state detector light source 33 of the tenth embodiment is not contained within the adapter 5, but is provided within the illuminating light source 60. Therefore, within the light source 60, in addition to the illuminating light source 67, filter 111 and connector socket 69 described with reference to the tenth embodiment shown in Figure 26, in this case the light source 60 also contains a focus state detector light source lamp 121 fitted in a lamp base 121 , and a further connector socket 123 is arranged in front of this light source lamp 121 to hold a light guide cable 125 fitted by a connector 124 to the socket 123, the other end being fitted to a light guide entry port 126 provided on the adapter 5, so that light from the focus state detector light source lamp 121 is transmitted to the adapter 5 and fed through the aperture 15 formed in the photoelectric transducer element 11 from the inner end face of the light guide cable in the entry port 126. The filters 117 and 111 in this eleventh embodiment have complementary transmission characteristics.For example, if the filter 117 only passes green, the other filter 111 will have a transmission characteristic passing all light other than that of the green wave length. The specific wave length may be a single wave length monochromatic , a narrow band of wave lengths, or distributed wave length ranges. The operation and effect of this embodiment are the same as have been described of the above mentioned tenth embodiment, but as the focus state detector light source lamp 121 is contained within the light source 60, a strong light can be made available for focus state detection, to be projected as a spot on the object 25, without making the adapter 5 undesirably bulky, although the detector output signal will be larger and the focus state can be detected with higher precision. Figure 28 shows a twelfth embodiment, wherein a common illuminating light source 67 is used to provide the focus state detector light source 121 inFigure 27. A semi silvered mirror 127 is arranged inclined with respect to the light path between the illuminating light source 67 and the filter 111. A condenser 128 and reflecting mirror 129 are arranged in sequence on the optical axis of the illuminating light reflected by the semi silvered mirror 127, so that this reflected light is directed by the reflecting mirror 129 to be projected onto the end face 124A of the focus state detector light transmitting light guide cable 125 in the connector 124. The other parts are the same as in the above mentioned eleventh embodiment. With the arrangement shown in Figure 28, the light passed through the semi silvered mirror 127 forms the observing and diagnostic illuminating light, and comprises the light frequencies other than that or those used for focus state detection, these light frequencies being selectively passed by the filter 111.This illuminating light is transmitted to the light guide entry port 2 through the light guide cable 59 to be projected onto the object 25 through the illuminating light transmitting means within the endoscope 4. On the other hand, the light from the lamp 67 reflected by the semi silvered mirror 127 is condensed by the lens 128, re directed by the reflecting mirror 129 to be projected onto the cable end face 124A in the connector 124, transmitted to the adapter 5 through the light guide cable 125, and then passes through the aperture 15 of the photoelectric transducer element 11, when the light of the specific wave length will be selectively passed by the filter 117 to be projected as a spot onto the object 25. The state of focus can be detected by measuring the light reflected back through the filter to be incident on the light receiving transducer element 11. Therefore, the operation and effect are substantially the same as those described for the eleventh embodiment but a single light source lamp 67 replaces the two lamps used in the eleventh embodiment. Figure 29 shows a thirteenth embodiment, wherein the light is separated into an illuminating and diagnostic component and a focus state detection component by a dichroic mirror. That is to say, in this embodiment, a dichroic beam splitter 130 is used to replace both the filter ill and the semi silvered mirror 127 in the twelfth embodiment, as described with reference to Figure 28.This beam splitter 130 has dichroic characteristics, selectively reflecting light of a specific wave length, and transmitting light other than that of this wave length. The other parts are the same as described for the twelfth embodiment, and this embodiment has substantially the same operation and effect as those described for the twelfth embodiment, but as the illuminating light and focus state detection light are effectively separated from each other by the dichroic mirror 130, the illuminating light will be projected onto the object 25 more efficiently than in the case of the twelfth embodiment, wherein the light is divided by a semi silvered mirror 127 and subjected to further loss in the respective filters 117 and 111.Therefore, the embodiment is advantageous both for observation and for focus state detection. Figure 30 shows a fourteenth embodiment, which is generally similar to the tenth embodiment, described with reference to Figure 26, but having a filter arranged in the light guide entry port connector instead of the filter 111 within the light source 60. As shown in a magnified fragmentary detail forming part ofFigure 30, a filter 132 replacing the filter 111 ofFigure 26 is arranged in the part opposed to a light guide entry port connector 131 of the light guide cable 59 fitted to the light guide entry port 2 of the endoscope 4. The magnified detail clearly shows the filter 132 that selectively transmits light other than that of a specific wave length that is to be used for focus state detection. The filter 132 is arranged on the end face of the light guide entry port 2 and is fixed by a filter retaining member 133 that is screwed to the light guide entry port 2 and accepts the light guide entry port connector 131, which is screwed to the filter retaining member 133. The filter 117 arranged within the adapter 5 selectively passes only the light of the specific wavelength, as described above. This embodiment is of substantially the same operation and effect as described for the tenth embodiment, but offers an advantage, in that the filter 132 and filter retaining member 133 can be used to avoid modifying the light source device 60. The filter 132 can be fitted in any part of the light path defined by the light guide cable 59, i.e.at either end connector, or in any coupler unit connecting two cable lengths. In the embodiments described with reference toFigures 26 to 30, the tenth to fourteenth embodiments a simple wave length such as green is desirable as the specific wave length to be selected for focus state detection, which is virtually a range finding operation when one is considering a moving object and the triggering of an exposure to record a photographic or television image. However, any colour not anticipated to be present in the object 25 will be effective, and a band of frequencies, or even a plurality of bands may be selected, if desired. Precisely complementary colour selection is not essential, and if light of specific wave length or band is to be projected for focus state detection, light of wave lengths other than that specific wave length or band may be used for the light to be projected for illumination and diagnosis, or there may be some limited overlapping, or some colour band or bands that are not used for either function. For example, a white light source may have green and blue wave lengths excluded and be used for the illuminating and diagnostic light, whilst an exclusively green light is used for focus state detection. When using a light receivd ng transducer element that has a very selective sensitivity to the specific wave length to be used for focus state detection, the filter 117 can be arranged to the rear of the photoelectric transducer element 11, in front of the light source 33, 121 or 67, as the case may be. The filter 111 arranged within the light source 60 may be withdrawn from the light path during exposure, as described for the tenth embodiment, and this can be effected automatically or manually, as desired in any particular case. As different respective wave lengths are used for focus state detection and for illumination and diagnosis, there is an advantage that the focus state can be detected with high precision in a simple apparatus, and without interfering with the observation function. Figure 31 shows the relevant modified parts of a fifteenth embodiment of the present invention, in which the filter 132 of the fourteenth embodiment, described with reference to Figure 30, is arranged in a connecting adapter 135 interposed between the connector socket 69 of the light source 60 and the connector 70 of the light guide cable 59. The connecting adapter 135 is formed of an adapter body 136 and a connector socket 137 screwed to the adapter body 136. The adapter body 136 is fitted to the connector socket 69 of the light source 60.Communicating holes in each of the members are filled with light transmitting fibres 138. The illuminating light is projected onto the end of these fibres 138, which face the illuminating light source lamp 67.The light, excluding the specific wave length that is to be used for focus state detection, will be passed by a filter 132 arranged in a hollow facing the other end of the fibres 138, to be projected via a condenser lens 139 onto the end face 70A of the connector 70 of the light guide cable 59. The camera adapter 5 and camera 6 are formed as shown schematically in Figure 26, with the filter 117 that only passes the light of the specific wave length arranged in front of the photoelectric transducer element 11, within the adapter 5. A sixteenth embodiment is shown in Figure 32, in which both the illuminating light used for observation and the focus state detector light is fed from a common lamp 67 within the light source 60 as in Figure 28 but separated within a connecting adapter 135. The camera adapter is as shown in Figure 27, and the respective connectors 70 and 124 of the light guide cables 59 and 125 are fitted to respective connector sockets 69 and 123 . This embodiment functions in the same manner as the twelfth embodiment shown in Figure 28, tut has an advantage that the connecting adapter 135 makes it possible to adapt an existing light source 60, without internal modification. A seventeenth embodiment is shown in Figure 33 which corresponds to the embodiment shown in Figure 29 and functions in like manner, but has a dichroic beam splitter 130 contained within the connecting adapter 135. Again, there is the advantage that an existing, conventional light source 60 can be used. An eighteenth embodiment is shown in Figure 34 which corresponds to the fifth embodiment shown inFigure 17, but has the mechanical chopper 42 within the connecting adapter 135. The camera adapter 5 is the one shown in Figure 17, and the operation of this embodiment as described with reference to Figure 17. A nineteenth embodiment is shown in Figure 35, which corresponds to the eighth embodiment shown inFigure 22, but has the means by which the illuminating light can be cut off during focus state detection range finding mounted in the connecting adapter 135. The plunger 93 arranged within the connecting adapter 135 will rotate the light intercepting plate 92 from the position shown by solid lines to the position shown by broken lines, to intercept the illuminating diagnostic light during range finding, but will withdraw it from the light path back to the position shown by solid lines when an exposure is to be made. As a means for controlling the above mentioned operation, a control circuit 68 is contained within the connecting adapter 135 so that when connecting adapter 135 is fitted to the light source 60, this control circuit 68 can be electrically connected through a connector 141 with the light source 60, which is provided with a connector socket 142 to transmit and receive the required signals. The operation of this embodiment is as described with reference to Figure 22. A twentieth embodiment is shown in Figure 36, in which a semi silvered mirror 127 is arranged in the position of the light intercepting plate 101 of the ninth embodiment shown in Figure 25. Most of the light from the lamp 67 will be reflected by this mirror 127 to be projected onto the end face of the light guide cable 103 and used as illuminating light, and the remaining light component passed by the semi silvered mirror 127, will pass on through the aperture 15 and be monochromatised by the filter 117 to be used for focus state detection. If a dichroic mirror passing only light of a specific wave length and efficiently reflecting light of other wave lengths, such as the dichroic beam splitter 130 shown in Figure 29, is used in place of the semi silvered mirror 127, colour selection will be effected and both the illumination and focus state detection be made more efficient. If the arrangement is different from the one shown in Figure 36, for example, if the light guide entry port 102 is opposite to the end face of the light guide cable 103 instead of to the aperture 15, the dichroic beam splitter could have the characteristics of the beam splitter 130.shown in Figure 29. A twenty first embodiment is shown inFigure 37, in which most of the light transmitted through the light guide cable 59 is transmitted to the light guide 103 through a light guide 144 within the adapter 5, and a branch light guide 145 emits light to be projected as a spot for focus state detection. The focus state detector is as shown inFigure 19, using split prisms, and having a light aperture arranged opposite the end face of the spotilluminating light guide 145. By the way, if the illuminating light transmitted to the light guide cable 103 from the light guide 144 is filtered, using a filter such as the filter 111 Figure 26 etc. arranged in the light path to exclude the specific wave length that is to be used for focus state detection, the focus state detection function will be made more precise. In this twenty first embodiment, the light amount received by the photoelectric transducer element 54 will be maximum when in the correctly focused state. A twenty second embodiment is shown in Figure 38, in which the focus state is detected by using two separate light receiving transducer elements 72A and 72B, as described with reference to the embodiment shown in Figure 20, instead of the single photoelectric transducer element 11 shown in Figure 36. The two light receiving transducer elements 72A and 72B are arranged, one on each side of the optical axis, to form an aperture 151 so that each output signal received and photoelectrically converted by these light receiving transducer elements 72A and 72B may be used to detect the state of focus using the focus state detector circuit shown in Figure 21. This embodiment has advantages, in that the state of focus can be detected without being adversely influenced by the dark current level, and the direction in which the lens 8 needs to be displaced to set the image in the correctly focused position, if necessary, can be analysed and therefore the correctly focused state can be set more quickly. If it is desired to ipdicate the direction the image is deviated from the correctly focused state, the focus state detecting circuit shown, for example, in Figure 21 can be used, if the output of one comparator is connected to one lamp indicating one non focused condition and the output of the other comparator 76 connected to another lamp indicating the other non focused condition. The two lamps will then indicate whether the focusing of the lens 8 is deviated to the near rear side from the correctly focused state, that is, at the so called front focus, or is deviated to the far front side, that is, at the so called rear focus, depending upon which of the lamps lights. If the lens 8 is moved in response to such indication, the lens can be quickly set in the correct focus state and the focus state indicating lamp 23 will then be energised.It is apparent that optical indicating means such as a lamp, LED or the like can be replaced by an audible indicating means such as a buzzer or the like. In the twenty second embodiment and others, a transparent plate member 74 is positioned in front of one light receiving transducer element 72A, so that the light path length may be slightly different from that of the other light receiving transducer element 72B. Instead of a transparent plate member 74, a wedg.e shaped prism may be arranged over one or both photoelectric transducer surfaces 71A and 71B to give different light path lengths, or the two light receiving transducer elements 72A and 72B may be arranged in a stepped formation, and or the two elements 72A and 72B may be inclined so that the respective light path lengths differ significantly. In each of the above described twentieth to twenty second embodiments, Figures 36 to 38 the detector is contained within the adapter 5. However, it is obvious that the arrangements described can be incorporated in a camera 6, or in a hard or soft endoscope. This applies to all the other embodiments. Further, in the twenty second embodiment, focusing is detected using two light receiving transducer elements 72A and 72B, but three or more light receiving transducer elements can be used to detect focusing, if desired.
