## Description
THE THERAPEUTIC USE OF PROSTAGLANDINS The present invention provides a new use of known pharmacological agents. In particular, this invention relates to method for treating patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS sometimes known as adult respiratory distress syndrome resulting from shock, trauma or sepsis and preventing death resulting from multiple organ damage in this disease. ARDS seems to be secondary to embolization to the lungs of microaggregates of platelets and or white cells.The syndrome, and the associated multiple organ failure, accounts for most of the noncerebral deaths of patients who have been resuscitated from shock, trauma, and sepsis or the other inciting events of TableI. The pulmonary failure is characterized by ventilation perfusion mismatching with low arterial oxygen concentrations, poor lung compliance, and in some cases, increased pulmonary vascular resistance. In addition to damage to the lungs, damage to other organs is associated with shock, trauma, and sepsis. Overall mortality in patients with ARDS or other severe organ failure, after shock, trauma, or sepsis, is over 50 . Current treatment of ARDS concentrates on treatment of the underlying shock, trauma, or sepsis. .Rapid resuscitation from shock, rapid control of bleeding, early institution of mechanical ventilation with a volume ventilator, and titration of intravascular volume, sometimes using a Swan Ganz pulmonary arterial catheter, help in treatment of shock.Immobilization of fractures, debridement of dead or devitalized tissue, drainage of pus, closure of holes in the gastrointestinal tract, diversion of the gastrointestinal tract proximal to damage, and administration of antibiotics can all help prevent the adverse effects of tissue trauma or infection. Only a few specific treatments, however, are available to treat ARDS or other organ failure once it develops.In those cases where patients are suffering from severe cases of ARDS, large doses of heparin therapy may be given in an attempt to reduce intravascular clotting and microembolization to the lungs. Heparin, however, increases the risk of additional bleeding in patients suffering from severe injuries. The method proposed here would treat ARDS and other organ failure after shock, trauma,or sepsis without risks of this sort. This invention also relates to a method for treating patients who are at risk for developing failure of vital organs lungs, liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, brain, or heart as a result of a catastrophic, traumatic, or septic event. These inciting catastrophic events have been extensively described for ARDS and some are listed in Table I. These are the events which place the patients treated by this invention at risk for vital organ failure. Like ARDS, failure of other vital organs may be secondary to the embolization and or deposition of platelets and or white blood cells to or in the liver, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, brain, or heart. Liver and kidney failure are usually noted initially by the appearance of pathologic levels of certain cell products in the blood bilirubin and creatinine, for example . Failure of the gastrointestinal tract may present with gastrointestinal bleeding. Brain dysfunction may present with disorientation. Heart dysfunction may present with congestive heart failure associated with low cardiac outputs and high end diastolic ventricular filling pressures. Bilirubin levels above 5 mg and creatinine levels above 2 mg S indicate failure of the liver or kidney.Gastrointestinal hemorrhage requiring transfusion represents failure of the gastrointestinal tract. Severe disorientation to person, time, or place represent brain dysfunction. A cardiac index less than 3.3 liters.min 0.m 2 associated with right atrial pressures greater than 8 mm Hg or left atrial pressures greater than 15 mm Hg represent failure of the heart these pressures are measured with respect to atmosphere with the pressure transducer located at the level of the mid thorax with the pressures being measured at end expiration . The patient population to be treated by the prostaglandins of this invention include those who have evidence of organ failure, diagnosed as previously described respiratory distress, embolization and or deposition of platelets or white cells to the vital organs, high levels of blood bilirubin or creatinine, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, disorientation, decreased cardiac index, etc. as a result of the inciting events such as those listed on Table 1 or who are at significant risk for organ failure as a result of the acute inciting events such as those of Table 1.These risks are generally known to those skilled in the art and include the following 1 Any septic or traumatic insult that results in the patient requiring ventilatory support This is evidence of beginning lung failure. 2 Documented peritonitis 3 Lung contusion or major thoracic trauma tri Major non thoracic trauma 5 An operative procedure requiring 6 or more units of blood in the perioperative period 6 Second or third degree burns involving about 30 or more of the patient s body 7 Significant fat embolization resulting from trauma or surgery 8 Hemorrhagic or septic shock 9 Cardiogenic or anaphylactic shock 10 Severe viral, bacterial or fungal pneumonia 11 Inhalation of oxygen greater than 50S 02 , smoke or nitrous oxide for an extended period of time 12 Aspiration of gastric contents into the lungs 13 Drug overdose 111 Disseminated intravascular coagulation 15 Near drowning fresh or salt water 16 Pancreatitis or uremia 17 Patients requiring long periods on cardiopulmonary bypass 18 Patients whose heart has stopped for a prolonged period greater than 3 minutes 19 Air or amniotic fluid embolization and 20 Any patient who requires multiple transfusions of 6 or more units of blood. See, also, e.g., Pepe, et al., Clinical Predictors or the AdultRespiratory Distress Syndrome, American Journal of Surgery, 144 124 1982 . The prostaglandins used in the present invention are derivatives of prostanoic acid. A trivial system of nomenclature has been devised, which classifies the prostaglandins according to the substituents on the cyclopentane ring. See, N.A. Nelson, Journal of MedicinalChemistry, 17 911 1974 . For a further discussion of the prostaglandins, see Bergstrom, et al., Pharmacol. Rev. 20 1 1968 , and references cited therein. The term prostaglandin analog herein refers to those compounds structurally related to the prostaglandins in that they exhibit a cyclopentane, or adjacently homologous cycloalkane, ring and a pair of side chains attached to adjacent carbon atoms of the ring which retain characteristic biological properties of the prostaglandins.See Bergstrom, cited above. Various structural modifications of the prostaglandins are known to produce useful prostaglandin analogs.Many of these structural modifications are discussed in the U.S. patents set forth below. Prostaglandin E1 PGE1 , PGE2 and PGI2 are known derivatives of prostanoic acid. P 1, its lower alkyl esters, salts and amides are known to be potent pharmaceutical agents. The use of PGE1 and its alkyl esters, salts and amides for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease by non intrarterial administration is described in U.S. Patent 11,103,026.In U.S. Patent 4,116,988 various uses of P 1 are described.

In accordance with the manner and process of using the present invention, a PGE1 like prostaglandin in pharmaceutical dosage form is administered systemically to humans to treat or prevent ARDS or multiple organ failure as described herein. The terms shock , trauma , and sepsis are used in their ordinary accepted meaning in the art.Shock may be generally described as a condition of acute circulatory failure due to derangement of circulatory control or loss of circulating fluid. It is frequently marked by palor and clamminess of the skin, decreased blood pressure, feeble rapid pulse, decreased respiration, restlessness, anxiety, and sometimes unconsciousness. Trauma may be generally described as any wound or injury. This can be the result of surgery. Sepsis may be generally described as a serious bacterial infection with a concurrent, deleterious systemic response. The term ARDS is well defined. in the medical literature, as described above.It is caused by well known factors, for example those noted above and in Table I. All of these terms are well known to physicians of ordinary skill. By severe vital organ failure is meant a decrease in functioning of a vital organ gastrointestinal tract, brain, liver, kidney, lung, or heart to the extent that the chance of survivability is low.By humans having or prone to vital organ failure is meant a human experiencing or recently experiencing a catastrophic event such as trauma, sepsis, shock or other events placing one at risk for ARDS or vital organ failure such as those listed above and in Table 1.These persons are readily identified by a skilled physician, using, e.g., these factors and the clinical symptoms set forth above. By unit dose is meant a discrete quantity of a prostaglandin and a carrier useful for systemic administration in the method of this invention. Thus, an ideal unit dose would be one wherein one unit, or an integral amount thereof, contains the precise amount of prostaglandin for this purpose. These unit doses can be packaged in a variety of forms. The prostaglandin may be dissolved or suspended in the carrier, or the prostaglandin and the carrier may be combined just prior to administration. Accordingly, the prostaglandin in pharmaceutical dosage form is systemically administered, preferably intravenously, to the patient at a rate of about t to 100 ng kg min for PGEi like compounds of theFormula I and 0.1 to 10 ng kg min for PGI2 its salts, esters, amides, and stabilized analogs, respectively, for a period of about 2 14 days or until the patient extubated, or until the patient is no longer threatened by the organ failure. The preferred rate is 20 to 30 ng kg min and 2 to 5 ng kg min, respectively, over a period of about 7 days. PRE1, its alkyl esters and salts are well known, readily available compound and can be prepared by methods known in the art. U.S. Patent 3,069,322 discloses such methods. The essential material constituting a disclosure of how to prepare PGE1, its lower alkyl esters and salts are incorporated by reference from U.S. Patent 3,069,322. Amides of POEl can be prepared by methods known in the art for converting carboxylic acid moieties to carboxylic acid amide moieties. Such methods are described, for example, in U.S. Patents 3,954,741 and 4,100,192 columns 10 and 11 . Both of these patents are expressly incorporated by reference herein. The other prostaglandins within the scope of this invention are known and can be synthesized by the methods described in the U.S.patents noted in the Information Disclosure statement above, which are expressly incorporated by reference herein. PGI2 and its pharmaceutical salts, esters and amides can be prepared by the methods disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,158,667 and 4,338,325. Stabilized analogs thereof are described in U.S. Patents 4,238,414 and 4,420,632. The essential material constituting a disclosure of how to prepare prostacyclin, its pharmaceutical salts, and stabilized analogs are incorporated by reference from these U.S. Patents. In accomplishing the purposes of this invention those compounds which are useful are those prostaglandins and prostaglandin derivatives which are at least 1S as potent as PGE1 in preventing and or ameliorating the deleterious consequences of trauma, sepsis, shock or other traumatic events listed in Table 1 under the conditions of the Examples. These compounds are referred to herein as PGE1 like compounds because of their similar biological activity. Examples of such compounds includePGI2, and salts, esters, amides and stabilized analogs thereof including carbacyclin and 9ss methyl carbacyclin , and those prostaglandins of the Formula I described above, particularly PGE1 15S 15 methyl PGE1 15R 15 methyl PGE1 16, 1 6 dimethyl PGE1 2 decarboxy 2 hydroxymethyl PGE1 PGE2 1 5 keto PGE2 16, 1 6 dimethyl PGE2 17S,20 dimethyl 6 oxo PGE1, methyl ester 17S,20 dimethyl trans delta 2 PGE1 PGE2, N methanesulfonylamide 9 deoxo 9 methylene 16,16 dimethyl PGE2 155 15 methyl P GE2 1 5R 1 5 methyl P GE2 11 deoxy 16,16 dimethyl PGE2 11 deoxy 11 alpha 16,16 trimethyl PGE2 6 oxo 11 deoxy 11 alpha 16,16 trimethyl PGE2 6 oxo PGE2 6 oxo PGE1 11 deoxy 15 methyl PGE1 PGE3 16, 16 difluoro PGE2 and 20 isopropylidene PGE1 as well as the alkyl esters, pharmacologically acceptable salts and derivatives thereof. These compounds may also be in stabilized forms including clathrates see, e.g., U.S. Patent 4,254,736 , triacetin see U.S. Patent 3,966,962 or triacetin ethanol see U.S.Patent 11,301,175 formulations, triacetin silicon dioxide gels see copending application S.N. 613,006, filed 21 May 19811 , and the like. These patents are incorporated by reference herein. PGE1 is the most preferred compound of this invention. Pharmaceutical dosage forms of PGE1 like compounds here for intravenous infusions can be formulated by known conventional methods.Other dosage forms of these compounds are also well known. PGE1, also known as alprostadil, is the active ingredient of Prostin VR Pediatric, which is sold by The Upjohn Company to aid in the maintenance of patency of the ductus arteriosis in neonates.See, physicians Desk Reference, p. 2043 38th Ed. 1984 . This sterile solution of P POE1 is most preferred for use in the method of the instant invention. A similar formulation can be used for other prostaglandins. For the treatment or prevention of ARDS or organ failure the PGEi like prostaglandin in a pharmaceutical dosage form is preferably administered through a central venous catheter or through the right atrial port of a Swan Ganz catheter, and the dosage is increased until a dose of 30 ng kg min is reached. The dosage is calculated on the basis of the patient s pre illness weight. A preferred method of administration is to begin with an infusion rate of 5 ng kglmin and to increase the dose by 5 ng kg min every 30 minutes until a rate of 30 ng kg min is obtained. The prostaglandin is given for a total of seven days, until the patient is extubated, or as long as the patient is threatened by organ failure.The infusion rate of 1 to 100 ng kg min is maintained as long as the mean systemic arterial pressure does not decrease more than twenty 20 percent from baseline levels. If there is a decrease of more than 20 in the arterial pressure, the infusion rate is decreased until levels within 20S of baseline levels are reached again. Discontinuing the drug preferably proceeds by decreasing the dosage 10 ng kg min per hour. Equivalent dosages for other PGEi like prostaglandins are also employed, based on the compound s potency as compared to PGE1. The identical procedure is utilized for the treatment or prevention of ARDS and or multiple organ failure with PGI2 and salts, esters, amides, and stabilized analogs thereof, except that the dosage is 0.1 to 10 ng kg min., preferably 2 to 5 ng kg min. The intravenous route is preferred for PGEl like prostaglandins including PGI2, its salts, esters, and amides . However, other systemic and non systemic routes of administration e.g., oral, enteral, rectal, parenteral including via implanted devices, intra arterial, cutaneous as via patches may also be employed as long as the dosage used achieves the same blood level of drug or equivalent effect as the intravenous route. A convenient route may be into the right atrium through the right atrial port of a Swan Ganz catheter, if such a catheter is in place. The following Examples are illustrative of the uses of this invention, but are not to be construed as limiting.Example 1 Treating Severe Lung Failure with PGE1 An intravenous solution was prepared by mixing one 5 ml ampoule of Prostin VR Pediatric Sterile Solution containing 2.5 mg PGE1 active drug with one liter of Dsw or Normal Saline. Dosages of this solution or of a control solution containing only vehicle but no PGE1 were administered to 41 patients suffering from ARDS in a prospective randomlzed double blind placebo controlled study. PGE1 or the control solution was started at a dose of 5 ng kg mln and then increased 5 ng kg min every 30 minutes until a rate of 30 ng kg min was reached. This dosage was continued for 7 days or until the patient was extubated, whichever came sooner. The survival rate 30 days after discontinuing the infusion was as follows Treatment Number of Patients Survival Rate S PGE1 21 71.4 Control 20 35.0Example 2 treating Severe Organ Failure with P 1 Fifty patients with ARDS were randomized to receive POE1 30 ng kg min for 7 days or placebo equivalent volumes of saline and time in a double blind study. For entry, patients must have required mechanical ventilation with an inspired oxygen concentration of 40 or more and a positive end respiratory pressure of 5 cm of water or more.Most of the patients 70Z were septic. 17 out of 26 patients who had received P 1 survived 65 survival while only 7 out of 24 patients who had received placebo survived 29 survival . The relation between the bilirubin and creatinine levels and the mortality of the patients enrolled in this study is depicted inTable 2. As can be seen, there is a significantly higher survival rate for those patients who were treated with POE1 while their creatinine and bilirubin levels are in the normal range. Creatinine and bilirubin levels are indicative of kidney and liver function, respectively.The data thus indicate that P 1 prevents severe kidney and liver damage, and greatly decreases the risk of death, for patients highly susceptible to kidney failure, liver failure, and or death as a result of trauma, sepsis, shock, and similar catastrophic events. Example 3 Preventing Organ Failure with P 1 A patient with peritonitis diagnosed at surgery has a significant risk of developing multiple organ failure 20 30 . The patient has an intravenous line placed so that its tip resides in the subelavian vein. A solution of PGE1 in normal saline 2.5 mg in 1 1 saline is infused at the rate of 5 ng kg min. The dose is increased at the rate of 5 ng kg min every 30 minutes until a maximum infusion rate of 30 ng kg min is achieved. This dosage is continued for 7 days to prevent the development of severe organ failure, including ARDS.During this period the peritonitis is brought under control surgically as needed and with antibiotic therapy. Example 4 Preventing Organ Failure with PGE2 A patient is involved in a motor car accident and receives severe damage to the abdominal region with massive internal bleeding. During the period prior to shortly after surgical repair of the abdominal injuries a total of 8 units of blood were required to maintain an adequate blood volume. This subjects the patient to significant risk for the development of organ failure. An intravenous line is established in the subclavian vein and PGE2 in normal saline 2.5 mg in 1 1 saline is infused at the rate of 5 ng kg min. This dose is increased at the rate of 5 ng kg min every 30 minutes to a maximum of 30 ng kg min.This dosage is continued for 5 days to prevent the development of vital organ dysfunction.Example 5 Preventing Organ Failure with PGI2 A patient is admitted to the intensive care unit with labored breathing following surgery. During induction of anesthesea, the patient aspirates stomach contents into the lungs which results in pulmonary insufficiency. A venous line is established and a solution of prostacyclin PGI2 is infused at the rate of 2.5 ng kg min. This infusion rate is maintained for 7 days to prevent the development of vital organ liver, kidney, lung, heart failure. The patient is retained for an additional 2 days in the intensive care unit ICU .Example 6 Preventing Organ Failure with PGE1 A patient is admitted to the hospital emergency room following a fall of 8 stories from a building under construction. He has six fractured ribs, a fractured tibia and multiple contusions. The broken tibia is set and the patient is held for observation. During the fifth day his blood bilirubin levels, which had been rising, are at 6 mg dl and his creatinine levels are 2.2 mg dl. Infusion of a solution of POE1 in dextrose is started into the subclavian vein at the rate of 5 ng kg min and increased over a period of 2 hours to 30 ng kg min.This dosage is continued for 7 days to prevent further organ damage from occurring.
