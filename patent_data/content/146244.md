## Description
This invention relates to an optical instrument for detecting displacement of a scale, utilizing interferenceof light, in particular to such an instrument utilizing a multimode semiconductor laser device as a lightsource. Among the various optical instruments for measuring displacement, which can detect variations inposition length of displacement of a diffraction grating by making diffracted light interfere, using adisplacing diffraction grating as a scale, are known a type of instrument for which variations in wavelengthare essentially permitted, in which detection of displacement is effected by utilizing interference betweendiffracted light beams of the same order and different signs, plus and minus, as disclosed in the publicationof Japanese Utility Model No. 81510 1982 or the provisional publication of Japanese Patent No.191907 1983, and also another type of instrument in which detection of displacement is effected by utilizinginterference between diffracted light beams of 1st order, as disclosed in Japanese Patent ApplicationNo.205956 1983. Since all of these prior art optical instruments for measuring displacement are so designed that theiroptical system is not subject to influences, such as destructive interference, etc., due to variations inwavelength of the light source within a permissible range, they have the advantage that it is possible to usea light source, which is defective in wavelength stability, but is not expensive, such as a semiconductorlaser device. On the other hand, however, in order that these optical systems can manifest their desired characteristics,it is necessary to adjust them in such a manner that the optical path lengths of two beams split bymeans of a beam splitter or diffraction grating in the interferometer, diffracted and finally made interferevary always equally. The reason why this is absolutely necessary is as follows. If their optical path lengthsdiffered from each other, phase variations in interference signals would be provoked by variations inwavelength at the same time as phase variations due to displacement of the diffraction grating which is tobe measured, which would give rise to measurement errors. In order to avoid such a drawback, precision of adjustment of the optical path lengths of the two beamsmentioned above should be, for example, from several 10 s of µm to several 100 s of µm in the case wherea semiconductor laser device is used without temperature compensation, although it is not possible tospeak generally, because it depends on variations in wavelength which are to be allowed and the requiredprecision as well as on the displacement length of the diffraction grating, to which a period of theinterference signals corresponds. It has been thought that for this purpose a high precision supporter for an optical system or a jig forpositioning it was necessary. The former was expensive and the latter gave rise problems that highprecision was required for adjustment, and that when fixing means such as screws were loosened, troubleswere often provoked in the optical system, what caused measurement errors. Furthermore, in the casewhere a well coherent light source such as a single mode laser and so forth was used, it was necessary todispose expensive non reflection coating on optical parts, because it was feared that phase shift might beproduced in interference signals due to superposition of unnecessary reflected light coming from surfacesof optical parts. In spite of these countermeasures it was difficult to keep adjustment precision within a certain range. An example of an instrument corresponding to the precharacterising part of claim 1 is disclosed in EP A 0065429. This invention has been made in order to take measures against the problems mentioned above andthe object of this invention is to provide an optical instrument for measuring displacement, which avoids theadjustment difficulties described above. According to this invention there is provided an optical instrument for measuring displacementcomprising the features of claim 1. Preferably the coherency is such that the variation in visibility of the interference pattern allowsdetection of non substantially equal optical path lengths i.e. path lengths which are sufficiently unequal withregard to wavelength fluctuations in the light source that otherwise undetectable errors could result from such wavelength variations. Hereinbelow this invention will be described more in detail using some preferred embodiments,referring to the drawings. Fig. 1 is a scheme showing the construction of an optical instrument for measuring displacementaccording to an embodiment of this invention, in which reference numeral 1 denotes a light sourceconsisting of a multimode semiconductor laser device 2 is a beam splitter for splitting a light beam intotwo 3 is a diffraction grating used as a scale 4, 7 and 13 are λ 4 plates 5 and 6 are a pair of mirrors 8 is ahalf mirror 9 and 12 are polarizing plates and 10 and 11 are photodetectors. In the device constructed as described above, a light beam emerging from the multimode semiconductorlaser device 1 enters the beam splitter 2 and is split at A into two beams, which proceed further towardB and C on the diffraction grating 3. Each of the light beams entering the diffraction grating 3 is diffractedand projected through a λ 4 plate 4 or 7 onto a mirror 5 or 6. Each beam is reflected at D or E and entersagain the diffraction grating 3. The beams diffracted again by the diffraction grating 3 return to the beamsplitter 2 and interfere therein with each other. Thereafter they are projected through the half mirror 8 on thephotodetectors 10 and 11, which detect interference intensity. In this manner displacement of the diffractiongrating 3 used as a scale is measured. In general, visibility of interference fringes in an interferometer is determined by coherency of the lightsource and by the difference between optical path lengths of the two interfering beams. For a well coherentlight source such as a laser device, in which single mode oscillation takes place, visibility is not lost, even ifthe difference between the two optical path lengths is great. To the contrary, in the case where a lightsource, whose coherency is not so good, is used, it is known that visibility of interference fringes changes,when the difference between the two optical path lengths varies. This invention has been made by applying this principle to the optical instrument for measuringdisplacement. In the device shown in Fig. 1, in order that no errors can be provoked by variation in wavelength of themulitmode semiconductor laser device 1, it is necessary that the path A For example, a commercialized semiconductor laser has characteristics of wavelength to temperaturevariation which is about 0.3nm C. Thus, assuming that the range of temperature variations is 10 C andthat the wavelength is 780nm, with a diffraction grating pitch in this optical system of approximately 0.55µmand assuming that required precision is 0.1µm, the differenceΔℓ between the two optical path length should be within the range which is so determined that the relation In order that this difference can be monitored it is necessary to use a light source allowing to detectvariations in Δℓ of this order of magnitude and moreover having suitable coherency for which visibility doesnot vary too much for Δℓ smaller than this value, because it is difficult to manipulate the device, when it istoo sensitive to Δℓ. When a suitable multimode semiconductor laser device is used according to this invention, theseconditions are fulfilled and it is possible to obtain variations in modulation for suitable variations in Δℓ, thatis, to detect variations in difference between the two optical path lengths as variations in modulation. Fig. 2 is a graph showing a relation between the difference Δℓ between the two optical path lengthsand the amplitude modulation of interference signals, obtained experimentally by means of a devicearranged as indicated in Fig. 1. As can be seen in Fig. 2, it is understood that adjustment of the optical path lengths can be effectedwith fairly high precision. For an optical system having a lower precision, a multimode semiconductor laser device having feweroscillation modes than that described above can be used. In this case, characteristic curves varying moreslowly than that shown in Fig. 2 are obtained. When use of a single mode laser device is desired, amultimode laser device is used only during adjustment of the optical system and after completion of theadjustment, it can be replaced by the original single mode laser device. Furthermore, in the case where a multimode semiconductor laser device is used, when a differencebetween the two optical path lengths is provoked by some cause, since the difference manifests itself aslowering of output signals and can be detected, one can avoid using it without knowing that errors due tovariations in wavelength are provoked. Further, since only interference between two beams having small Δℓcan be detected selectively, one can avoid interference signals which are varied by interference withunnecessary light reflected by surfaces of optical parts and thus precision can be ameliorated. In addition,since it is possible not to use non reflection coating on optical parts, optical parts which are not expensivecan be used. It is also possible to improve S N ratio with respect to that obtained when a single modesemiconductor laser device is used. Fig. 16 is a block diagram showing an example of the circuit displaying the difference of the opticalpath lengths in the embodiment shown in Fig. 1 and generating alarm and stop signals. Detection signalsobtained by using a photodetector circuit 101 comprising the photodetectors 10 and 11 are sent through anamplifier circuit 102 to a counter circuit 109, whose output signals drive a displacement display circuit 110,where magnitude of the displacement is displayed. At the same time, the detection signals are sent fromthe amplifier circuit 102 through a peak hold circuit 107 to an optical path difference display circuit 108,which displays the difference between the optical path lengths of the two beams. Moreover the detectionsignals are sent also from the amplifier circuit 102 to a sampling circuit 103, whose sampling output signalsare sent through a comparing circuit 104 to an alarm generation circuit 105, which produces alarm signals.The sampling output signals control also a stopping circuit 106, which stops the devices belonging to themeasuring system. Fig. 3 is a scheme showing an example of the construction of a signal detector, which can be used in adevice according to this invention. Reference numerals 28 and 29 denote polarizing beam splitters and 30to 33 represent photodetectors. Fig. 4 shows a concrete construction of the polarizing beam splitters 28 and29 and photodetectors. An interference light beam 21 produced by the two beams is split into two, 21A and 21B, by a halfmirror 22 and thereafter each of the split beams 21A and 21B is further split by means of a polarizing beamsplitter 28 or 29 into two beams, which are directed toward two directions different by 90 from each otherand projected to photodetectors 30, 31 or 32, 33. That is, after interference, components parallel to thesheet of the figure emerge toward the photodetector 30 and components perpendicular to the sheet emergetoward the photodetector 31. In this case, the phases of the two interference signals differ in phase by 180 from each other andtheir intensities are almost equal. On the other hand, the relation between the two split beams coming from the light beam reflected by the half mirror 22, passing through a λ 4 plate 25 and directed toward the detectors 32 and 33 is the sameas that between the split beams directed toward the detectors 31 and 30. Fig. 5 is a circuit diagram of a cancelling circuit used in the device according to this invention, in whichD The polarizing beam splitter 28 will be explained as an example. The 1st photodiode D In the circuit described above, since the D.C. components of the 1st and 2nd photodiodes D Since the polarizing beam splitter 29 acts in the same manner as that described above, large detectionsignals, whose phase is different by 90 from that indicated in Fig. 6 a , as shown in Fig. 6 b , can beobtained at the output terminal. It is useful to this invention, if characteristics of the two photodiodes connected in series are identical,signals containing no unnecessary components such as D.C. component, dark current and so forth areapplied to the input of the amplifier AMP and amplified with a high gain. Therefore, it is possible to obtainlarge output signals. Moreover, if two photodiodes are formed on the same substrate, as indicated in Figure7, it is possible to obtain output signals having still higher quality. As explained above, when the signal detecting part is constructed as indicated above, large detectionsignals can be obtained. According to this invention, since D.C. components can be cancelled with few parts only by combiningextremely simple optical parts with a cancelling circuit, it is possible to obtain detection signals, which arenot only large but also of high quality, and thus reliability of the device is improved. Fig. 8 shows another example of the construction of the optical instrument for measuring displacementaccording to this invention, in which reference numeral 41 represents a diffraction grating used as a scale 42 and 43 are a pair of mirrors 52 and 53 are another pair of mirrors 44 is a light source 45 is aphotodetector 54 is a beam splitter for splitting the light beam emerging from the light source into two and55 denotes a normal to the diffraction grating 41. In the arrangement of the device described above the light beam 46 emerging from the light source 44and projected on the beam splitter 54 is split into two, that is, the light beam 46A directed to the mirror 42and the light beam 46B directed to the mirror 43. The light beams 46A and 46B are projected through themirrors 42 and 43, respectively, on the diffraction grating 41 on both sides of the normal axis 55 with equalincident angles. The diffraction grating 41 is so disposed that the grating vector is directed horizontally onthe sheet of the figure, and that the direction of the displacement to be measured of the diffraction grating41 used as a scale coincides with the direction of the grating vector. Thus, the light beam 46A reflected bythe mirror 42 is further so diffracted that it is projected on the mirror 52, and at the same time the lightbeam 46B reflected by the mirror 43 is further so diffracted that it is projected on the mirror 53. In this case,the incident light beams 46A and 46B are so diffracted that the optical axis of one of the diffracted lightbeams 47A or 47B coincides with the optical axis of the others incident light beam. Thereafter the diffracted light beams 47A, 47B are reflected by the mirrors 52, 53 and projected againon the diffraction grating 41. Here they are again diffracted. Thus the diffracted light beam 47A coming fromthe mirror 52 is projected on the mirror 42 and the diffracted light beam 47B coming from the mirror 53 isprojected on the mirror 43. They are reflected there and return to the beam splitter 54. In this beam splitter54 the optical axis of the transmitted light beam of that reflected by the mirror 42 coincides with that of thereflected light beam of that reflected by the mirror 43 and they interfere with each other. Therefore, thedisplacement of the diffraction grating 41 used as a scale is measured by detecting this interferenceintensity by means of the photodetector 45. In this case the detection signals and the displacement arerelated as follows. The complex amplitudes excepting the term varying in time E Moreover, the transmission coefficient T can be expressed by the following equation. Putting K 2ksin so that the grating vector K satisfies the diffraction condition described above, theequation 3 can be transformed as follows. The diffracted light beam is expressed by the product of E If as the grating a volume type hologram is used, almost no light appears except for the diffracted lightof 0th order and that of 1st order. In this case the propagation direction of one of the two diffracted lightbeams coincides with the incident direction of the other and their phases differ from each other by Pexpressed by the following equation. Putting now E Moreover, paying attention only to the diffracted light beams of 1st order, it can be understood that theyare waves propagating in the reverse direction along the same paths as that of the incident light beams. When these waves enter the beam splitter 54 the light beams reflected by the mirror 42 proceedsstraight and on the other hand that reflected by the mirror 43 is reflected so that these two beams have asame optical axis. Putting Further, interference intensity can be represented as follows. Examining this equation, it can be understood that phase variations, which are 4 times as great ascorresponding phase variations of the scale, appear in the interference signals. Putting ℓ for the displacementof the scale, the phase of the diffraction grating ψ can be calculated by the following equation. In this case, by utilizing the relation 2π 4ψ 4 2 2π λ sin L, the displacement L corresponding to oneperiod of the interference signal can be expressed by the following equation. As an example, assuming λ 7800Å, 0 45 , and using eq. 17 ,L 0.78 8sin45 0.78 8x0.707 0.138µmcan be obtained. In the case where this value is assumed to be standard, dividing the period by ten and several, it ispossible to measure a displacement of an order of 1 100µm. Moreover, when the optical path lengths of thetwo beams are equal, even if the wavelength of the light source varies, phase variations in the optical pathsare also equal. Thus C 0 and interference signals which are invariant for variations in wavelength of thelight source are obtained. Further, even in the case where a light source, whose range of oscillationwavelength is large and which is not well coherent, is used, if C is small, it is possible to obtain interferencesignals. In the instrument according to this invention, as it is evident from the facts mentioned above, even if thewavelength of the light source varies, the optical path lengths of the two beams vary equally. Consequently,the instrument according to this invention is so constructed that the difference between the optical pathlengths C is maintained always equal to 0. This situation is kept also, when the scale diffraction grating moves vertically. Fig. 9 shows a example showing the optical paths, in which the broken lines indicate optical paths in thecase where the wavelength of the light source 44 varies. As indicated in the figure, since the optical pathsof the two beams vary symmetrically, no variations in difference between the optical path lengths appear,and therefore the interference is not destroyed, because angular shifts at the end of the optical paths arealso equal. Further, although the position of the second diffraction is displaced on the diffraction grating in thefigure, since the optical paths vary symmetrically in the horizontal direction with respect to those before thevariation in wavelength, influences of the variations in the optical path lengths are cancelled by each otherand thus they do not give rise to any phase variations in detection signals. Moreover, although the position of the interference beam emerging from the beam splitter 54 is more orless displaced, when the range of variations in wavelength is small, this displacement is extremely small. Inconsequence, if the photodetector 45 is sufficiently wide with respect to the displacement, no problems areproduced. Fig. 10 is a scheme where the diffraction grating 41 is moved vertically. In this case, even if thediffraction grating is displaced from 41 A to 41 B and the optical paths vary as indicated by the brokenlines, the position of the diffraction varies symmetrically in the same manner as for the variations inwavelength described above, influences of the vertical displacement of the diffraction grating are cancelledby each other. Fig. 11 is a scheme showing the construction of another optical instrument for measuring displacementaccording to this invention, which is so constructed that the diffracted beams are reflected by a pair ofmirrors 63, 64 and a beam splitter 54 makes them interfere with each other. Figs. 12 and 13 are schemes when variations in wavelength of the light source 44 are produced andwhen the diffraction grating 41 is displaced vertically, respectively, in the device shown in Fig. 9. Sinceinfluences of these variations are cancelled by each other by the same reason as that for Figs. 10 and 11,also in these cases they give rise to no problems. As other characteristics of the instrument according to this invention it can be cited that the incidentangle and the diffraction angle of the two beams are equal. By this reason the diffraction of the twobeams can satisfy, besides the grating equation consisting of This means that two diffractions by a grating having a grating vector in the x direction of the two beamsboth satisfy Bragg s condition. Consequently, it is possible to obtain a high diffraction efficiency by using avolume type hologram. Fig. 14 is a schematical view showing the interior of a hologram atrecording, when a volume typehologram is used, in which reference numeral 65 denotes a coherent plane wave 66 represents recordingmedium and 67 is an enlarged view showing the interior of the hologram. The grating surface isperpendicular to the surface of the hologram. It is possible to obtain a high diffraction efficiency, which is ashigh as nearly 100 , by suitably selecting a material for the diffraction grating and by using a diffractiongrating several µm thick. Moreover, fabrication of the scale becomes easier, because variations in gratingpitch due to deformation of the material, which is often produced during the fabrication of a hologram. aresmall by the reason that the grating surface is perpendicular. Fig. 15 is a perspective view showing a concrete construction of the arrangement shown in Fig. 9, inwhich reference numeral 71 indicates a semiconductor laser device 72 and 73 represent condenser lenses 44 is a polarizing beam splitter 75 is a grating for dividing incident wave 76, 77 and 78 are λ 4 plates 79and 80 are polarizing plates 81, 82 and 83 are photodetectors for sinuous wave, for monitoring and forcosinuous wave, respectively 84 and 85 are mirrors and 86 is a volume type hologram scale. For this example, a semiconductor laser device 71 is used as a light source a polarizing beam splitteris used as a beam splitter, and the signal light beam is separated from the incident beam by means of a λ 4plate. Moreover, the signal light beam is divided into 3 by means of a grating so disposed that the directionof the grating vector is perpendicular to the hologram for the scale and in this manner sinuous signals,cosinous signals and monitoring signals are obtained. In the instrument thus constructed, since a part of the incident light, which is proportional to the squareof the diffraction efficiency, is obtained as signal light, for example using a scale having a diffractionefficiency of 90 , it is possible to obtain signal light having an intensisty of 80 with respect to that of theincident light. Although it is known that returning light to the semiconductor laser device gives rise to noise,there is almost no returning light in this case. As explained above, since an optical instrument for measuring displacement constructed as indicatedabove comprises a light source, a beam splitter for dividing the beam emerging from the light source intotwo, a diffracting grating on which these two splitted beams are projected, reflectors on which two lightbeams diffracted by the diffraction grating are projected and which return the diffracted light beams towardthe diffraction grating, and detectors for detecting interference light of these two diffracted light beams andis so constructed that the two diffracted light beams are made interfere by the beam splitter and variationsin position of the diffraction grating are obtained by measuring interference intensity by means of thedetectors, following effects can be obtained Moreover, when a multimode semiconductor laser device is used as a light source in an opticalinstrument for measuring displacement embodying this invention, in which a movable diffraction grating isused as a scale and displacement of the diffraction grating is measured by using interference signals of thediffracted light beams, since non reflection coating on optical parts is unnecessary, it is possible to useoptical parts which are not expensive. Furthermore S N ratio is improved with respect to that obtained byusing a single mode laser device. Besides these advantages, the following effects can be obtained
