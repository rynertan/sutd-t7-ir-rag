# PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR THE REMOVAL OF OIL FROM AN OIL IN WATER DISPERSION AND PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF A SOLID MATERIAL SUITABLE FOR SAID PROCESS

## Abstract
In a process for the separation of oil from an oil in water dispersion by coalescence followed by separation of co alesced drops, coalescence is carried out at the surface of a solid material manufactured by contacting a solid material having active H atoms in surface groups or a polyolefin in the presence of water with a compound Si R¹ R² R³ R⁴ , in which R¹ is a cyclo aliphatic group containing one or more amino groups, R² a hydrolyzable group and R³ and R⁴ a hy drolyzable or non hydrolyzable organic group or a hydro lyzable atom. A process for the manufacture of the solid and an apparatus for said separation are also claimed.
