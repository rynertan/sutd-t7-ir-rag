# High speed, nonvolatile, electrically erasable memory system.

## Abstract
A method is disclosed for encoding binary data into an electrically erasable memory, said memory comprising a matrix of memory cells, each of said cells comprising a floating gate field effect pMOS transistor for storage of binary data and an npn bipolar transistor for selective access to stored data. The control gate of each storage transistor in a row is connected to an X write line the emitter of each bipolar transistor in a row is connected to an X sense line the source of each bipolar transistor in a row is connected to a source line and the collector of each bipolar transistor in a column is connected to a Y sense line. The method comprises a applying an erase voltage to each of said Y sense lines and, simultaneously, maintaining each of said X sense lines at said erase voltage, maintaining each of said X write lines at ground and applying said erase voltage to each of said source lines such that each of said storage transistors assumes a relatively negative threshold state and b applying a write voltage to selected X write lines while maintaining unselected X write lines at ground, and, simultaneously, maintaining selected Y sense lines at ground and unselected Y sense lines at an inhibit voltage which is less than said write voltage and maintaining each of said X sense lines at an intermediate voltage which is equal to or less than the base emitter breakdown voltage of said L bipolar transistors such that the storage transistors of memory cells located at the intersections of said X write lines and said selected Y sense lines assume a relatively positive threshold state.
