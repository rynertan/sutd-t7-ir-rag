# Turbomachine such as a compressor or pump comprising means for improving its part load behaviour.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of improving the part load behaviour of a turbo machine operating with a rotor 13 having fixed vanes 14. The said method uses the feature of applying auxiliary fluid injection nozzles 18 near the inlet 11 of the rotor 13 for adding a small amount of fluid to the main fluid flow. The said additional amount is directed such that a substantial velocity component of the movement of this additional fluid is directed tangentially with respect to the rotation of the rotor.
