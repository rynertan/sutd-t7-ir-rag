The particles extend up to 1000 Ã… transversely generally parallel to the surface of said sub strate 10 . The islands are separated by a short distance for facilitating coalescence of particles together to effect writing of spots at low energy by the lateral motion and gathering of the islands during heating of the islands by a laser beam or the like. Each spot represents a data bit in a binary position code. The matrix material has low thermal conduc tivity and preferably a low melting point to facilitate writing at low energy.

## Description
AN OPTICAL STORAGE MEDIUMThis invention relates to an optical storage medium for storing binary data by forming coding spots in the medium by a focussed high energy intensity beam.Interest in the development of optical data storage systems has been stimulated recently by the introduction of optical video disk systems and the continued improvement in potentially inexpensive GaAlAs laser diodes.One of the major obstacles to the introduction of these systems is the development of suitable optical storage materials. A candidate material should exhibit 1 low writing energy compatibility with GaAlAs lasers , 2 long lifetime and 3 low cost. Several material systems have been investigated including A Thin Metal Films, D. Mayden, Bell SystemsTechnical Journal 50, 1761 1971 and P. Kivits, P. alm and R.

At an energy level above 0.3 joule cm the selenium was evaporated in the areas illuminated through the mask. Useful coating materials are selenium, arsenic, silver, cadmium, zinc, tellurium, and radiation absorbing pigments and dyes.U.S. Patent 4,188,214 entitled Recording Material describes a laser recording material involving use of a recording medium of two materials, one of which is metal and the other of which is a compound such as a metal sulfide other than GeS, a metal fluoride or metal oxide. In thisKido patent it is suggested that the metal layer be a single layer formed of a mixture of the metals such as Au, Pt, Rh, Ag, Al, Ti, Cr, W, Cu andTe as well as many others cited in Col. 2 of this Kido patent, which are less relevant to the instant invention. No suggestion of the concept of using a polymeric or organic matrix to support the metal particles was suggested. FIG. 3 shows particles of metal supported in a matrix of the compound.The compounds are employed because of their energy absorbing characteristics to pass heat into the metal particles to increase the sensitivity of the recording material. Also, the compounds have a higher melting point than the metal materials which are more reflective. The compounds are also more stable chemically and not hygroscopic. The method of operation of the recorder is to deform or evaporate the medium.U.S. Patent 4,069,487 describes coating of an optical storage layer with an organic or inorganic layer for protection. In FIG. 6 of that patent, the optical storage layer is a laminate of a non metallic layer and a metallic layer which combine to form a recording layer.According to the invention there is provided an optical storage medium for storing binary data by forming coding spots in the medium by a focussed high intensity energy beam, characterised in that the medium comprises a substrate of a matrix material having a low melting point and a discontinuous thin film layer of particles of an energy absorbing material on said substrate, said thin film layer having islands of the energy absorbing material whereby focussed energy can be directed to heat individual ones of said particles to cause a change in the reflectivity of said medium to record information at the sites where heating has occurred.Preferably the film is a noble metal selected from the group consisting of gold, silver, copper, platinum, palladium, and rhodium.The Drexler reference describes a recording medium commercially available which includes metal particles carried in a polymer matrix on a flexible disk with the particles dispersed in a film similar to an exposed photographic emulsion.Drexler uses dispersed particles of metal rather than a single discontinuous thin film of metal. Further, the particles are dispersed randomly, whereas in accordance with the instant invention, there are islands of metal in a single discontinuous layer. Furthermore, the amount of metal included in the medium is far greater in quantity in theDrexler media since it is dispersed throughout the thickness of the medium. Such a configuration tends to promote eruption of the particles from the medium causing ablation or vaporization of the medium. In contrast, the thin films of nucleated metal used in accordance with this invention are deposited by vacuum deposition techniques such as evaporation, sputtering, or electron beam thermal deposition techniques.These thin films coalesce rather than erupting.In this invention the thermoplastic melts when the energy absorbing metal material is heated by the laser beam. Furthermore, the thin film of the metal layered with the plastic is clearly different from a dispersion of the metal in the plastic. In this invention, the individual particles are rapidly heated by the incident laser radiation inducing localized particle coalescence which results in sufficient optical contrast for data storage. The contrast mechanism of U.S. Patent 4,252,890 of Howe differs substantially in scale thicknesses of about .001 to about .0l im in accordance with this invention as compared to .01to 2 im in Howe . Applicants also teach the use of noble metals such as gold in view of their improved stability whereas U.S.Patent 4,252,890 describes use of much less stable materials and is addressing the application of forming photographic types of images as contrasted with recording data on an encoded data storage medium.The medium embodying the present invention includes particles of small size composed of islands of an energy absorbing mate ial dispersed in a thin interior or exterior thin film layer of the particles juxtaposed with each other with small spacings whereby focussed energy can be directed to heat individual ones of the particles to cause a change in the reflectivity of the medium to record information at the sites where heating has occurred. Preferably the thin film layer is composed of a metal selected from the group consisting of gold, silver, copper, platinum, palladium and rhodium. Preferably, the thin film layer is selected from the group of noble metals of gold, platinum, palladium and rhodium, and the thin film layer is composed of particles ranging in thickness from about .001 to .01 micrometers and the particles range from about 0.0025 to 0.1 micrometers wide. Preferably, a radiation reflecting layer is juxtaposed with the thin film layer separated by an intermediate layer having a thickness equal to 1 4 wavelength of the radiation to be applied to the medium.In general, then it is preferred that the energy absorbing material of this invention comprises particles of gold ranging in thickness from about 0.001 to about 0.01 micrometers and in width from about 0.0025 to about 0.1 micrometers. A dust cover can be provided to protect the energy absorbing material. Preferably, a reflective layer is juxtaposed with a thin film layer separated therefrom by an optically transparent layer. The energy absorbing material comprises particles of gold on the order of about 0.003 micrometers thick and about 0.005 to 0.01 micrometers in diameter. Preferably, the medium is applied with a density such that less than 4mg of gold is required for an area equivalent to a twelve inch diameter optical disk. The energy absorbing medium is transformed by laser writing to form marks characterised by particle sizes of about 0.02 to 0.04 micrometers in size.The particles are preferably prepared by means of vacuum deposition by a method including thermal evaporation, sputtering and ion beam deposition and the substrate comprises a material selected from polymethyl methacrylate PMMA , glass, polycarbonate and aluminium.The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings in which FIG. 1 is a schematic drawing of an enlarged section of a storage medium in accordance with this invention FIGS. 2 to 6 are modifications of the storage medium of FIG. 1 and are all in accordance with this invention FIGS. 7.1 to 7.4 are TEM images of Au particles deposited in a discontinuous form in accordance with this invention.

An effort to achieve that objective is manifested in the designs of FIGS. 1 6.In FIG. I a substrate 10 is coated with a thin discontinuous film of islands of reflective metallic particles 11. Islands 11 are about 25 to 1000 Angstroms wide and 10 to 100 Angstroms thick .001.01Wm thick and .0025 to .1 imwide . Alternative metals can be used for film 11, but they must be reflective.Gold is the preferred material and because of the extremely small amount of gold employed, the cost is low. Alternative metals are silver, copper, platinum, palladium and rhodium. All of the metals are noble metals or extremely stable. The particle sizes are on the low side forPt, Pd and Rh, yet they offer excellent stability and larger sizes of particles of Cu, and Ag permit their use as an economical substitute for gold. When recording is performed a high intensity energy beam such as a laser is directed upon the metallic particles which absorb the energy and become heated. The localised heating forms a coalesced spot in which the metallic particles join together or agglomerate greatly reducing the space through which particles are dispersed. We have discovered that the reflectivity afforded by the film of particles is reduced very significantly.The temperature of the particles is controlled by the properties of the substrate 10. The thermal conductivity of the active media is dominated by the substrate 10 since the metallic film 11 is discontinuous and the optical absorption properties are attributable to the properties of the metallic film 11.The substrate 10 should be composed of a material which is compatible with the support of layer 11 and if the light for writing data on the storage medium is to be applied from below the substrate through it to heat the layer 11, then the substrate material must be transparent. A transparent substrate 10 could be composed of PMMA, glass, fused quartz and other suitable materials. The thickness of the substrate could be on the order of 1 mm 1000cut . Preferably, the substrate is glass or a plastic such as PMMA. In addition, if light is exposed to the upper surface of the medium shining down on layer 11, then there should be a dust cover 16 which keeps dust from collecting on the surface of layer 11. In this case, the substrate could be of any material of suitable flatness and surface quality and need not be optically clear.In the case of FIG. 2, the structure of FIG. 1 has been modified by the addition of a layer 12 of a plastic material such as PMMA which preferably is clear optically and non birefringent. Preferably, in this case light is applied to the metal layer 11 from the back side of the substrate as indicated by the arrow. FIG. 3 shows another modification of the structure of FIG. 1 wherein there is a reflective layer 15 composed of a mirror like material such asAl, Ti, Cr, or Au, Pt, Rh which are expensive for that purpose . The layer 15 is preferably about 500 to 1000 Angstroms thick. Between the layer 11 and layer 15 is a layer 14 of a polymer or plastic material which is optically transparent and about 1 4 wavelength at the frequency of the laser used to write on the medium. For example, the layer 14 could be on the order of 1000 1400 Angstroms thick 0.1 0.14Wm. thick .Preferably, a dust cover 16 is provided so that light can be applied to the medium from the top without degradation of the image caused by dust particles since they are held away from the surface of the recording layer 11.FIG. 4 shows a modification of the FIG. 1 and 3 structures to provide a reflection layer 15 on top of the spacer layer 14 with the reflective layerw of islands on a transparent substrate 10 which is adapted to have light shone through the back surface as illustrated by the arrow.FIG. 5 is the same as FIG. 3 with the exception that a dust protection layer 12 has been deposited upon the layer 11 as in FIG. 2. FIG. 6 is the same as FIG. 4 with the exception that layer 12 has been applied on the top as in FIGS. 2 and 5. The media of FIGS. 1 to 6 is exposed preferably by means of a laser such as a gallium arsenide laser with a wavelength from 780 880nm.Alternative lasers are HeNe 632.8nm, Kr 647.lnm, Ar 488nm and HeCd. The intensity is about 0.5n joule micrometer squared. The duration of the laser beam applied to the media is 10 nanosecoods up to about 1 microsecond. The power of the beam is from 20 milliwatts down to about 1 milliwatt.Tellurium is not a particularly good choice for the metal in these structures due to its poor lifetime qualities and low melting point. A better choice from a lifetime standpoint would be noble metals such as gold, platinum, rhodium or high stability alloys with suitable film nucleation properties. In FIGS. 7.l 7.4 we show the film nucleation properties of gold. It can be seen that this is a suitable material for this application. FIG. 7.1 shows a deposit of 10A of Au on a carbon substrate with a scale of lcm representing about 1000A. FIG. 7.2 shows o the pattern for 20A of Au on a carbon substrate. FIG. 7.3 shows the o pattern for 30A of Au on a carbon substrate. FIG. 7.4 shows the pattern o for 40A of Au on a carbon substrate. Magnification is about 98000 times for each image.Our measurements and calculations indicate that about 30Angstroms 0.003cut of gold in a single polymer sandwich would result in an optimized optical structure exhibiting reflectivity changes of greater than 50 between the written and unwritten case. This represents a cost of less than 25c 12 disk for the gold. Many other metals are also appropriate for this process if their film nucleation properties are suitable. For instance, Ag, All Ti, Cr, W, Cu, etc., all provide lower cost than the noble metals. Of these Ag is known to form small nucleation islands. Al is of particular interest due to low cost and potentially high stability after surface oxide formation this oxide is self limiting .An extremely wide range of polymers exist which would be applicable to these structures. They would be selected for long lifetime, low thermal conductivity and low writing temperature. For fabrication ease polymers that can be glow discharge deposited are of special interest.Fabrication of samples to date has included the solution casting of the thin polymer layers and thermal evaporation of the metal. This involves several steps. A more practical approach would be to use glow discharge techniques for the polymer deposition followed by thermal evaporation of withe metal layer. In this way a multi layered structure could be fabricated in a single vacuum chamber. In summary 1 Discontinuous metal films can be fabricated through the use of thin film nucleation mechanisms. 2 These structures have been successfully demonstrated. In particular we show that the thermal conductivity effects of the metal can be greatly reduced by using a discontinuous film. This will allow the use of more stable materials than tellurium as previously discussed. 3 A fabrication technique including the glow discharge deposition of the polymer with thermal evaporation of metals in a single chamber is proposed. This would allow the entire optical structure to be fabricated in one system with potentially high yield. 4 That since the metal loaded polymers are formed by a highly repeatable film nuclea tion process, they will be much more uniform than those obtained through solution casting techniques.Here we consider the use of discontinuous metal films as the active layer in an ablative optical structure. We demonstrate that systems can be configured utilizing potentially stable noble metals as the active material while providing writing energies that are superior to tellurium based systems. The obvious goal of this work is to provide sensitivity without compromising lifetime.The nucleation of thin films has been studied by several authors EK. L.Chopra, Thin Film Phenomena, McGraw Hill Book Company, 1969 D. W. Pashley, M. J. Stowell, M. H. Jacobs and T. J. Law, Phil. Mag., 10 127, 1964 . In particular the island formation of gold films below some critical thickness is well known. In FIGS. 8.1 and 8.2 respectively, the measured reflectivity and transmissivity of gold films on PMMA substrates are shown as a futlstion of wavelength. For the deposition conditions employed here lA0 sec deposition e nto 250C PMMA substrates at 5 x 10 torr , films 3.0nm thick or less form a discontinuous island structure with individual islands 5.0 10.0nm in diameter. For thicknesses above 3.0nm, rapid networking of the islands is observed.The optical absorption of discontinuous films 100 R T neglecting scattering effects can be as high as 30 . This strong optical absorption coupled with a relatively high optical reflectivity make these films candidates for optical storage applicatlois. This is particularly true when a trilayer structure is employed, A. E. Bell and F. W. Spong, IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics, 14, 497 1973 . This anti reflection geometry dramatically increases the light absorption in the gold while providing high readback contrast.FIG. 9 shows the measured optical reflectivity from gold trilayers for varying gold thicknesses of 2.0, 3.0 and 4.Onm. The trilayer structure utilized is shown in the inset. The resist used is Shipley AZ1350J. For the 2.0 and 3.0nm films less than 10 of the incident radiation is reflected at wavelengths from 650 900nm. The 4.0nm film an electrically conducting film indicating at least partial continuity exhibits greater reflectivity at wavelengths above 650nm, but excellent optical coupling still exists.The ability to couple optical energy efficiently into the ultra thin gold layer is certainly desirable, but it does not insure that the film can be ablated at low energies. Trilayers with a continuous 7.5nm thick titanium active layer were found to require four times more energy than an equivalent structure using tellurium, Bell et al supra and A. E. Bell and R. A. Bartolini, APL, 34, 275 1979 . There are two principle reasons for this increase. The melting point of titanium is more than l0000C higher than for tellurium while its thermal conductivity is nearly an order of magnitude greater. Thus titanium must be heated to a much higher temperature in order for writing to occur, while at the same time losing more energy due to thermal diffusivity effects.Based on this comparison one would not expect gold trilayers to exhibit low writing energies. The melting point of gold while less than that of titanium is still 6000C greater than that of tellurium. Furthermore, the bulk thermal conductivity of gold is nearly two orders of magnitude greater than that of tellurium. This is somewhat offset by the discontinuous nature of the gold film which limits lateral thermal dirfusivity, but typically it is thermal losses from the film to the substrate that are most significant. M. Chen, V. Marrello and W.Y. Lee, Materials ResearchSociety Meeting, Boston, Mass., November 1980 unpublished .The optical writing characteristics of these films were studied using a microcomputer controlled static laser writer that incorporates a krypton laser X 647.lnm with a 0.6 N.A. focussing objective. In these tests, the optical reflectivity change at the surface was monitored as a function of writing power and pulse width. For comparison of the writing energy with other materials, we use the point at which the optical change induced in the material is 50 of the maximum change that is attainable through increased writing energy. The values of writing power vs. gold thickness for several gold trilayers as a function of gold thickness are shown in FIG. 10. Pulse width is a parameter. The structure compared is that shown in FIG. 9. From this it is evident that films above 3.0nm thick require significantly more writing energy. This corresponds to the point at which the discontinuous gold islands start to network into a continuous film. This rapid increase in writing energy cannot be explained by the gradual increase in optical reflectivity with thickness.Obviously the discontinuous nature of the film plays a major role in determining the writing energy. Furthermore, it should be noted that the writing energy of these structures is quite non reciprocal with pulse duration indicating that shorter pulse durations will result in a reduction in writing energy. The minimum 50 contrast writing energy is seen to be 0.2nJ 5mw 40 nsec. for trilayers using a photoresist layer as the dielectric spacer.FIG 11 shows a comparison of the writing power vs. pulse width curves for gold trilayers using a photoresist spacing layer designated by x , aPMMA spacing layer designated by o and a 25nm tellurium layer on a PMMA substrate designated by squares eel . In FIG. 11 the 50 writing power vs. pulse duration for gold trilayers 2.5nm gold is compared to similar results for a 25.0am tellurium film on a PMMA substrate. The discontinuous gold trilayer utilizing a photoresist spacing layer compares well with the results for tellurium only for short pulse durations. However, when PMMA is utilized as the spacing material the writing energy is reduced by a factor of two. This improvement can be attributed to the low thermal conductivity of the PMMA.In this case the discontinuous gold trilayer exhibits lower writing energy than tellurium for pulse durations up to X 300 nsec. The 50 writing energy is 0.1nJ for a 40 nsec.. pulse duration. Non optimized, totally encapsulated samples using polymerized photoresist as both the spacing layer and overcoat material have shown 50 writing energies of .6nJ 50 nsec.pulse using a GaAIAs laser radiating at 830nm. This value should be significantly improved by utilizing materials such as PMMA for the spacing and overcoat layer.The low writing energy for this class of materials can be attributed to the writing mechanism which we discussed below. However, regardless of the actual mechanism, it seems clear that a positive driving force to hole formation does exist. When a single discontinuous gold layer 2.5nm on a PMMA substrate is compared directly to a continuous 25nm tellurium layer see FIG. 13 , the gold exhibits a threshold writing energy zero optical contrast that is a factor of two lower even though roughly half as much energy is absorbed by the gold. However, for relative contrast levels of 60 , the gold requires 50 more writing energy. This result lends credibility to the belief that the discontinuous films have a more gradual spot forming process than continuous films.A scanning electron micrograph SEM image of spots written on a gold trilayer using a PMMA spacing layer is shown in FIG. 12. These spots were written with a 0.l4nJ 3.5mw for 40 nsec., 647.lnm wavelength pulse, and exhibit a relative optical contrast change of 70 . The image suggests that gold is still present within the written spots, but this is not clear. At lower writing energies, spots .51urn in diameter have been observed.The second major criterion that a potential optical storage material must satisfy is adequate lifetime. By its nature, this property is more difficult to demonstrate. The fact that a noble metal is utilized as the active layer in these structures lends credibility to the potential lifetime from a corrosion point of view however, it is not clear that the small particles will be stable. Possible degradation mechanisms include 1 slow coalescence of the islands even at room temperature, 2 diffusion of the gold and 3 deterioration of the thin polymer layer.Slow changes in optical properties have been observed for discontinuous gold films on PMMA substrates at 750C, however, thinner samples have demonstrated excellent thermal stability over a thousand hours at 650C.We have demonstrated that discontinuous gold films exhibit writing energies that are compatible with GaAlAs lasers. Possible writing mechanisms have been proposed with sintering of the 5.0 10.0nm islands being preferred at present. The lifetimes of these films are under study, and indications are that stable systems can be developed.In the course of our investigation of optical storage materials we have found that discontinuous films behave fundamentally differently from continuous films. Metal loaded polymers operate through the use of film nucleation mechanisms. Such metal particles act as local absorbers that heat and ablate a polymer matrix. In a continuous metal film a spot is written by first bringing the film to its melting point. However, this is insufficient to form a hole in general. This is due to an energy barrier to hole formation which depends on the surface energy of the various materials present, i.e., there is no positive driving force to cause the hole to open at the melting point.We have found that in discontinuous films this is not the case. Here there is a net driving force that causes the particles to coalesce thus dramatically affecting the optical properties of the layer. In the case of small particles as formed by thin film nucleation this coalescence can proceed rapidly even at low temperatures if sufficient energy is provided to cause the individual particles to come into contact. For 50A diameter Au particles it has been calculated by Pashley et alPhilosophical Mag. 10, 127 1964 that significant coalescence can occur in less than 1 nsec. at 4000C after the individual particles come into contact. Particles of this size can be fabricated in a single discontinuous layer by using thin film nucleation phenomena.Furthermore, if a layer of these particles is incorporated in a trilayer structure, up to 90 of the incident radiation can be absorbed by the particles. In its undisturbed state the layer is stable since there is insufficient energy for the individual particles to come into contact. However, when the spot is rapidly heated by a laser beam, random motion of the particles increases due to 1 higher temperature, 2 changes in the underlying layer i.e., melting, glass transition or decomposition and 3 high radial temperature gradients which act on the particles to push them preferentially from the centre of the spot. When the particles collide, coalescence occurs and as this happens the optical properties are changed. Evidence for this mechanism was found when an SEM of an overburned spot on a Au trilayer discontinuous film showed Au balls coalesced within the spot. Spots of this type exhibit contrast changes as high as 15 to 1. This hole opening mechanism is also suggested by the results shown inFIG. 13. Here we compare the writing characteristics of two films The o first is a 250A thick Te layer on a PMMA substrate while the second is a o 25A thick discontinuous Au layer on a similar PMMA substrate. Due to the optical properties of the two films, only approximately half as much energy is absorbed by the Au layer. We note that the reflectivity change of the Au layer is much more gradual than for the Te. This indicates that as the centre of the spot is heated above its threshold, permanent damage is done over a relatively restricted region. However, for the Te case it is more of an all or nothing response. Due to the high thermal conductivity and melting point of Au one would expect a higher threshold energy than for the Te layer, even when the thickness differences are considered.The lower threshold observed can be attributed to 1 a positive driving force for hole information, 2 reduced lateral thermal conductivity because of the discontinuous nature of the film and 3 the fact that it is not necessary to melt the gold islands to cause them to coalesce.Dramatic evidence of the importance of film discontinuity to writing energy is shown in FIG. 10. Here 50 writing thresholds for Au trilayer structures are shown as a function of the Au thickness. There is a rapid increase in writing energy for Au films greater than 30A 3nm thick.Experimental data from TEM studies and electrical conductivity measurements indicate that Au films start to be continuous for thicknesses o greater than 30A under the deposition conditions used. For all the samples shown in FIG. 10 different Au thickness the fraction of absorbed light varies relatively little and cannot account for the dramatic change.In FIG. 14 various Au trilayers utilizing different polymers as the spacing layer are compared with a 250A Te film on PMMA from a 50 threshold writing point of view. We see than in almost all cases, the Au trilayers are superior. This is particularly true for short pulse durations 40 nsec. and one would expect this improvement to be greater for shorter pulses.It is surprising that thin films of gold have writing energies comparable to those for tellurium or tellurium based alloys. The low thermal conductivity of tellurium 3.2 w m K coupled with its low melting point 4500C allow it to be ablated with a focussed laser beam of relatively low energy. However, it has been found that due to the nature of the hole opening process it is necessary to heat a local region of the film to temperatures well in excess of its melting point in order to create a hole in the film. This is particularly true if writing times of less than a few hundred nanoseconds are desired.Gold, on the other hand, has a much higher thermal conductivity 312 w m K and a much higher melting point 1063 C than tellurium and thus, if the writing mechanism were similar i.e., hole burning through film melting and pullback , one would expect a relatively high writing energy. Indeed it has been shown that continuous gold trilayers as distinguished from the discontinuous films of this invention require much more writing energ than a 30.0nm tellurium film.However, the writing mechanism for discontinuous gold films is quite different than it is for continuous films. In order to better understand the hole forming mechanism for this class of materials, written spots were examined by transmission electron microscopy. Samples were prepared by depositing 2.5nm of gold at 0.1nm sec onto a photoresist layer. Under these conditions the gold film is found to be made up of slightly networked islands that are 5.0 to 10.Onm in size. Spots were written onto this sample using a krypton laser .6 N.A. objective lens at a 647.lnm wavelength . The gold layer was then transferred to a carbon film and examined by transmission electron microscopy.In FIG. 13 a high magnification transmission electron micrograph image of two written spots is shown. The hole size of approximately 0.6 micron indicates that these spots were written with about 1 nj of energy, 1mew, o 100 nsec. . The film used was 30A of Au on a polymer transferred to a carbon film for TEM examination. Within the written region relatively large spherical gold islands are visible while regions outside of the written spot are unchanged. It is interesting that the transition from the written to unwritten region is quite abrupt indicating that a temperature threshold to coalescence exists. This threshold is thought to be due to the necessity of breaking the initial gold islands free from the substrate material before rapid particle coalescence can occur.It is surprising that the sintering of particles as shown in FIG. 14 can occur as rapidly as required for optical storage applications. Initially the film consists of gold islands on the order of 5.0 to 10.0nm in size while the written region has particles on the order of 20 to 40nm in size. In FIGS. 15.1 15.4 the reflected and transmitted optical radiation is shown as a function of time for two write pulse powers. The onset of coalescence is seen to occur in approximately 20 nsec. for the 15 mw pulse employed in FIGS. 15.1 and 15.2. When the pulse power is reduced by a factor of two the onset of coalescence is seen to occur in approximately 50 nsec. In both cases the final reflectivity decreases by a factor of two in the final state, but the change occurs more rapidly at the higher power level.The coalescence or sintering of small particles has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically. Pashley et al supra have shown by studying adjacent frames of cine, film recorded from a transmission electron microscope that relatively large gold islands 200.0 to 1000.0nm at 4000C on a MoS2 substrate can significantly coalesce in less than 60 nsec. Theoretical predictions assuming a surface diffusion driven sintering mechanism indicate that the rate of sintering should be inversely proportional to the particle radius to the fourth power.An approximate relationship for the rate of sintering is given by EMI18.1 where x is the radius of the neck that forms between two particles, r is the particle radius, t is the time and A T is given by EMI19.1 where Yis the surface energy of the particle, T is the temperature, k isBoltzman s constant, Ds is the surface diffusion coefficient and is the atomic volume. More detailed calculations have been carried out, but the above is an approximation for x r .4.Using the above relationship and the properties for gold one would predict that 5.0nm radius particles would coalesce to x r .l in about 10.0 nsec. at a temperature of 400 C. Obviously the particles in FIG. 15 have coalesced to a much greater extent than x r .l, however, this is not surprising since the temperatures involved are certainly greater than 4000C based on thermal modelling considerations. To the first order in temperature, the parameter A T is given by EMI19.2 where c is a constant of the material and Qs is the activation energy for surface diffusion. For activation energies from 1 2 ev a 1000C increase in temperature above 4000C will result in a 1 2 order of magnitude increase in the sintering rate. As particles coalesce the average particle size increases and thus one would expect the rate of coalescence to decrease if the temperature remains constant. The reflectivity during writing results shown in FIGS.16.1 16.4 provide some evidence of this. From these curves it is seen that after coalescence begins there is a rapid drop in optical reflectivity with the first 10.0 20.0 nsec. followed by a much more gradual decrease. However, this response can also be at least partially attributed to the fact that as the reacted spot size increases, it does so in a region where the light intensity is lower and a smaller change in reflectivity is expected.From the experimental observations presented, the writing process appears to proceed as follows 1 the incident laser radiation is absorbed by the individual gold islands resulting in a rapid temperature rise of the particles and the underlying substrate, 2 above some threshold temperature the gold particles are freed from the substrate and begin to migrate about the surface, 3 particles which come into contact rapidly sinter into a single larger particle and 4 as sintering continues less energy is absorbed due to the local reduction in optical absorption that occurs within the region of coalescence.There are several novel features of this writing mechanism when compared with the writing process for continuous metal films. While it is possible that the melting point of gold is reached during the writing time especially when short writing times are used it is not a necessary condition. Continuous films, on the other hand, require that the melting point of the metal be reached. In fact, for short writing times, calculations P. Kuits, J. Vac. Sci. Tech., 18 1 68 Jan Feb 1981 indicate that superheating occurs. For discontinuous films the minimum written spot size is controlled by the island size while continuous films exhibit a minimum hole size that is a function of the film thickness, the surface energy of the substrate and the surface energy of the metal.Finally, discontinuous films form written spots as a gradual process that proceeds from the hottest regions while continuous films exhibit a more binary hole opening process.The potential advantages of using discontinuous metal films especially small islands are obvious 1 The positive driving force toward particle coalescence results in low writing energies. 2 Low writing energy can be obtained using even relatively high melting point high thermal conductivity materials. For in stance, the melting point of gold is 6000C greater than the melting point of Te while its thermal conductivity is two orders of magnitude higher, and yet it can be made to exhibit a low writing energy threshold. This allows one to use stable materials such as the noble metals Rh, Pt, Au or highly stable alloys or any other thin film that exhibits proper film nucleation. 3 Minimum spot size is controlled by the film island size and for optical recording minimum spot size is not a factor. 4 Since very little material is moved to write a spot, overcoats will not greatly affect the writing energy. This has been shown using an encapsulated Au trilayer at GaAs wavelengths. 5 If the writing mechanism is indeed a solid state reaction, the melting point is no longer significant. Writing energy can be optimized by controlling the island size spacing, the island mass, selecting high surface diffusivity and surface tension materials for the absorber and low melting decomposition polymers with low surface energy as the spacing layer in a trilayer or as a substrate in a single film. This application discusses the theoretical and experimental advantages of discontinuous films for optical storage applications. A particular structure Au trilayers with various polymers as the spacing layer is shown that exhibits a factor of two 40 nsec. pulse improvement in the writing energy when compared to a conventional 250 Te on PMMA structure.A novel mechanism for writing is described which, if correct, will allow this structure to be further optimized using techniques described. The laser writing characteristics of discontinous gold films are interesting since 1 the writing energy is compatible with GaAlAs lasers, 2 the active layer is potentially archival since a noble metal is utilized, and 3 the resolution of the material is well above the resolution achievable with visible light. Writing energies of less than 0.5 nanojoules per spot have been achieved using a GaAlAs laser emitting at 840nm. In its initial form gold films approximately 2.5nm thick with individual islands 5.0 to 10.0nm in size have been utilized. Subsequent work has allowed the use of thicker films with improved optical properties however, for these films the individual island size is increased to 20.0 to 50.0nm.Since the written spot is approximately 1000.0nm in diameter it can be seen that the initial particle size is relatively small and thus should not affect the film resolution.In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that laser induced coalescence of gold particles can provide sufficient optical contrast for optical storage applications. The initial island size of say 5.0 l0.0nm is increased to 20.0 40.0nm within the written region. This results in at least a factor of two reductions in optical reflectivity with a commensurate increase in optical transmission. The onset of coalescence was seen to occur in less than 25 nsec. when a 15 mw optical pulse was employed .6 N.A. objective and a 647.lnm wavelength . This time appears to be at least consistent with the theoretical predictions for the sintering of small particles when the particle size and temperature are considered. While the final cost of an optical disk based on discontinuous films is difficult to predict, the high cost of noble metals is not a major factor. A 12 optical disk would require less than 4.0 mg of gold.
