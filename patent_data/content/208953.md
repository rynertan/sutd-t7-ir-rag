## Description
Histamine is a powerful vasoactive mediator which is released from specifically sensitized tissue mast cells and basophils following exposure to specific allergens, thus triggering an allergic response in an individual. While European Patent Application 110640 discloses a receptor based competitive inhibition assay for determining histamine levels in a body or laboratory fluid. Also disclosed are histamine indicator conjugates such as histamine horseradish peroxidase conjugate and histamine alkaline phosphatase conju gate, the latter being conjugated to histamine by reaction with 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide. The above noted published patent application reviews various other methodologies for the quantitative determination of histamine such as variations of an ortho phthalaldehyde conjugation assay, an enzymatic isotopic assay and chromato graphic techniques. In Mita et al The present invention is directed to certain histamine derivatives selected from the group consisting of Also disclosed are histamine immunogen conjugates of immunogenic carriers coupled to histamine derivatives or histamine, said conjugates selected from the group consisting of The invention is further directed to antibodies prepared against the above described conjugates including monospecific i.e., monoclonal antibodies and the use thereof in test kits and immunological methods for determining histamine in biological or laboratory fluids. The histamine derivatives of the present in vention may be prepared in such ways as to encompass a wide range of linking groups R and terminal func tional groups X. For example, R may be linear or branched alkylenes comprising from 1 to as many as 15, more usually 10 or less, and normally less than 6 carbon atoms i.e., methylene, ethylene, Representative methodologies for preparing the histamine derivatives having various linking groups R and terminal functional groups X will now be provided. Histamine derivatives of formula Derivatives of formula Histamine derivatives of formula Histamine derivatives of formula Functionalized histamine derivatives of formula Representative histamine derivatives of formula The histamine derivatives may then be used to couple said derivatives to an immunogenic carrier material through linking group R and terminal func tional group X of the derivatives. The immunogenic carrier material can be selected from any of those conventionally known. In most cases, the carrier will be a protein or polypeptide, although other materials such as carbohydrates, polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides, nucleic acids and the like of sufficient size and immunogenicity can likewise be used. For the most part, immunogenic proteins and polypeptides will have molecular weights between 5,000 and 10,000,000, preferably greater than 15,000 and more usually greater than 50,000. Generally, proteins taken from one animal species will be immunogenic when introduced into the blood stream of another species. Particularly useful proteins are those such as albumins, globulins, enzymes, hemocyanins, glutelins or proteins having significant non proteinaceous constituents, e.g., glycoproteins, and the like. Further reference for the state of the art concerning conventional immunogenic carrier materials and techniques for coupling haptens thereto may be had to the following Parker, The histamine derivatives are couplable to the immunogenic carrier materials according to well known techniques. For example, when the terminal function al group X of the histamine derivative is amino, said derivative can be attached directly to the carrier by the following means. The amino group of the histamine moiety can be attached to amino containing carriers e.g., protein or polypeptide carriers by toluene 2,4 diisocyanate A.F. Schick and S. J. Singer, Thiolated histamine derivatives i.e., those histamine derivatives wherein the terminal functional group X is thiol can be prepared from the corre sponding amino compounds by the procedure of I. M. Klotz and R. E. Heiney, Residue X of the conjugate will, of course, vary according to the terminal functional group X in the particular histamine derivative used, that is, may be imino, sulfo, oxy and the like. Alternatively, the terminal amino group of the histamine molecule It should be pointed out that as used in the formulae describing the immunogen conjugates herein, p represents the number of histamine moieties conjugated to the carrier. The number p is sometimes referred to as the epitopic density of the immunogen and in the usual situation will be on the average from about 1 to about 120, more normally from 1 to about 50. These densities however may vary greatly depending on the particular carrier material used. Preparation of specific antibodies using the present immunogen conjugates may follow any conven tional technique. Numerous texts are available describing the fundamental aspects of inducing antibody formation for example reference may be made to Parker, In a preferred embodiment the antibodies are obtained by somatic cell hybridization techniques, such antibodies being commonly referred to as monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibody produc tion will be exemplified in detail hereinafter, however, reviews of such monoclonal antibody techniques may be found in the following publications The antibodies prepared from the immunogens of the present invention can be used in various immunoassay methods, and the corresponding reagent means, for determining histamine, including agglutination techniques, radioimmunoassays, heterogeneous enzyme immunoassays e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 3,654,090 , heterogeneous fluorescent immunoassays e.g., U.S. Pats. Nos. 4,201,763 4,171,311 4,133,639 and 3,992,631 , and homogeneous separation free immunoassays. Such homogeneous immunoassays include techniques such as fluorescence quenching or enhancement e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,160,016 , fluorescence polarization Such assays are typically conducted on biological or laboratory fluids. The phrase biological or laboratory fluids as used herein refers to fluid preparations such as, for example, extracts prepared from a variety of biological substances such as cheese, fish, wine and the like as well as natural biological materials such as blood, urine, saliva and the like. The phrase also refers to any substance or material the histamine content of which is to be determined, including areas in the field of histochemistry where it may be desireable to determine the location of histamine in a given sample. Also provided within the scope of the present invention is a test kit such as a mercantile unit in order to carry out an immunoassay for histamine. Such kits will include one or more containers such as microtiter plates, solid supports, test tubes, trays and the like as well as antisera, for example in freeze dried form. The kit may also contain standard amounts of histamine whereby a standard curve may be constructed, containers for holding any necessary reagents for inducing an observable or otherwise measurable reaction and so on. Clearly, the skilled artisan can prepare a kit suitable for use in any particular immunoassay, the precise physical embodiment of which will depend upon the type assay contemplated. A preferred test kit is similarly a mercantile unit prepared for determining induced histamine release from cells into biological fluids such as whole blood, basophils, urine, saliva and the like. The components of such a kit may include, for example, one or more agents for inducing histamine release, various diluents and buffers in addition to the antisera, microtiter plates, histamine standards, reagents and the like as described previously. This kit may also contain a histamine conjugate or antibody bound to a solid support as well as a labeled antibody or labeled conjugate of histamine. The following examples are provided as a means of illustrating the present invention and are not to be construed as a limitation thereon. A solution of 1.11 grams g histamine free base and 3.02 milliliters ml of triethylamine in 10 ml of dimethylformamide DMF was added to a solution of 1.53 g of 3 bromo propionic acid in 5 ml of DMF. This solution was stirred at room temperature for two hours and then heated at 80 C for 2.5 hours after which time the solvents were removed by evaporation leaving a gummy residue. Said residue was dissolved in 10 ml of a buffer made of a mixture of CHCl₃ MeOH NH₄OH 10 5 1, respectively and applied onto a 60 g silica gel column packed in the same buffer . The column was eluted with this buffer at a rate of about 25 ml per fraction. The desired product was pooled fractions 33 63 and evaporated to dryness. The residue was crystallized with 10 ml of ethanol to render 600 mg of the title compound represented Analysis calculated for C₈H₁₃N₃O₂ ½H₂O C 49.99 H 7.34 N 21.87. Found C 50.62 H 7.51 N 21.89 68 mg of histamine propionic acid prepared as described in Example 1 and bovine serum albumin 100 mg were dissolved in 15 ml of H₂O. The resulting solution was cooled in an ice bath and the pH was adjusted to 4.5 with 1 normal N HCl. To this was added with stirring 320 mg of 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide hydrochloride EDAC in small portions. The pH of this reaction mixture was maintained at 4.5 5.0 with 1N HCl throughout the addition of the EDAC and the mixture was then stirred at 0 C for three hours and then overnight at 5 C. The pH of the mixture was then adjusted to 7.0 by the addition of 1N NaOH and the mixture was then applied onto a P 10 column 2.5 x 40 centimeters, equilibrated with a 0.025 molar phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 . The same phosphate buffer was then used to elute the column. The first UV absorption protein peak was collected and the protein concentration was determined by absorption at 280 nanometers nm i.e., A₂₈₀ nm 0.66 for a solution of mg ml. The amount of histamine was determined by the residual free NH₂ group on the immunogen using Habeeb s TNBS method. Using this procedure, about 80 90 percent of the bovine serum albumin was recovered. The molar ratio of histamine bovine serum albumin was found to be between 13 and 21. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin 200 mg crude, commer cially available from Cal Biochem was mixed with 4 ml of 50 mM carbonate buffer pH 9.6 and was briefly vortexed and sonicated. The pH of the resulting suspension was adjusted to pH 9.6 with 2N NaOH and was then stirred at room temperature overnight. The mixture was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 minutes after which the supernatant was recovered and the total protein concentration was determined by absorption at 280nm 20 microliters of the solution was diluted with 2.0 ml H₂O and A₂₈₀nm 1.66 was used for a solution of mg ml about 100 mg of protein was recovered . 82 mg of histamine propionic acid prepared as described in Example 1 was added to the above supernatant and the pH was adjusted to pH 5.0 by the addition of 1N HCl. Water was then used to bring the total volume to 7.5 ml and the solution was cooled in an ice bath. 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide 155 mg was added to the cooled solution with stirring and the pH was maintained at between 4.7 4.9 for two hours 0 C . The pH of the solution was then adjusted to 5.5 and was then stirred at 5 C overnight. The mixture was transferred to dialysis tubing cut off limit 12,000 14,000 dalton and was dialyzed against phosphate buffered saline 1 liter at 5 C. After five changes 7 days , the suspension in the tubing was recovered, a small portion of which was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 minutes. The supernatant was used to determine the protein concen tration by absorption at 280 nm, and the amount of histamine was determined by the residual free NH₂ group on the immunogen by Habeeb s TNBS method. All of the materials were combined and diluted to about 50 ml with phosphate buffered saline to render the desired immunogen conjugate. The molar ratio of histamine keyhole limpet hemocyanin was found to be between 83 and 116. 75 mg of bovine serum albumin BSA , 38.4 mg of 1 ethyl 3 3 dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide and 184 mg of histamine were mixed in a 0.1 molar boric acid solution to a total volume of 4.0 ml pH maintained at 4 5 . After stirring overnight room temperature the mixture was dialyzed extensively against phosphate buffered saline. Absorbance at 280 nanometers nm was measured and protein concentrations were calculated. Histamine epitope density was determined by scintillation counting using a tritiated histamine tracer, two representative runs having epitope densities of 17 and 53. The conjugates from the two runs were combined and used as described in the assay procedure of Example 6. Following standard techniques, female BALB C mice were immunized with histamine propionic acid bovine serum albumin and or histamine propionic acid keyhole limpet hemocyanin immunogen conjugates prepared as described in Examples 2 and 3, respectively and bled periodically over an approximately 4 month period. Spleen cells from immunized mice were mixed with the nonsecreting myeloma cell line X63.Ag8 653 publicly available from the The American Type Culture Collection having accession number CRL 1580 at a ratio of 2 1, respectively and fused with 50 polyethylene glycol 1,500 M.W. in the presence of RPMI 1640 medium containing no fetal bovine serum. The resulting hybridomas were seeded into 96 well microtiter plates with mouse thymocytes as feeder cells. The base tissue culture medium was composed of 15 fetal bovine serum and RPMI 1640 containing hypoxanthine and thymidine. Hybrids were selected by the addition of aminopterin to the culture medium. Anti histamine activity in whole serum was detected by polyethylene glycol PEG precipitation. Ten microliters µl of ³H histamine New England Nuclear containing 70,000 100,000 counts per minute cpm were incubated with either 100 µl mouse serum 1 10 dilution with phosphate buffered saline or 100 µl tissue culture supernatant for 2 3 hours at room temperature. In the case of tissue culture supernatants, 100 µl bovine gamma globulin 2 mg ml was added. Antibody was precipitated with 600 µl polyethylene glycol PEG 6000 20 w v . The pellet was washed twice with PEG 20 , resuspended in distilled water, and taken up in 3 ml of liquid scintillation counting fluid for scintillation counting. Cultures of hybridoma cells positive by the PEG precipitation assay were expanded and cloned by a single cell selection technique. With the aid of an inverted microscope, single cells were drawn from a dilute cell suspension into an elongated Pasteur pipet. The single cell was then seeded into a microtiter well containing mouse thymocyte feeder cells. Cloned hybridomas 10⁷ cells mouse were expand ed in ascites in pristane primed BALB C mice. Antibody from ascites was purified by caprylic acid precipitation as follows. Two volumes acetate buffer 60mM, pH 4 were mixed with one volume ascites and the pH adjusted to 4.8. Caprylic acid 0.74 ml 10 ml ascites was added dropwise at room temperature and the resulting suspension stirred for 30 minutes. After centrifugation at 4,000xg, the supernatant was collected and dialyzed extensively against phosphate buffered saline at 4 C to obtain an Ig fraction. High performance liquid chromatography of the pu rified Ig fraction revealed a predominant peak at a molecular weight corresponding to mouse IgG. Subclass and isotype analysis using a Chemicon Mouse isotyping kit determined that each of the hybrids expanded were producing IgG₁. Antibody affinities were measured using the RIA inhibition assay of Mueller The histamine bovine serum albumin conjugate of Example 4 was added to 0.1 molar NaHCO₃, pH 9.6 to a concentration of 75 µg ml. 50 µl aliquots of this solution were placed in the wells of a round bottom microtiter tray referred to as a coating plate . A few of the wells were either left open or filled with 50 µl of bovine serum albumin 75 µg ml in the 0.1 molar NaHCO₃ buffer to serve as controls. A lid with 96 pegs such as NUNC TSP or Falcon FAST lids was then placed on the coating plate and incubated for about one hour at room temperature. The lid with pegs was then removed and washed with 400 ml of a mixture of 0.05 percent Tween 20 in distilled water. A second microtiter tray referred to as the release plate was then prepared for the histamine release process as follows. A histamine standard curve was prepared by placing 5.5 µl of histamine standard solutions in successive duplicate wells. These standard solutions contained 10,000, 3333, 1111, 370, 123 and 41 nanomolar nM of histamine, respectively in distilled water or Tris ACM diluent i.e., a buffer of 25 millimolar, mM Tris pH 7.6 0.2 molar NaCl 5 mM KCl 0.3 mg human serum albumin 1 mM CaCl₂ and 0.5 mM MgCl₂ . In the course of the assay the concentrations of the histamine dilutions were further diluted ten fold.Stock allergen in 50 percent glycerol was diluted into seven serial ten fold dilutions using Tris ACM or distilled water as diluent. Aliquots 5.5 µl from each dilution not including stock were placed in successive duplicate wells of the release plate. This process was repeated for each desired allergen to be tested until the finished release plate had 5.5 µl of either histamine standards, allergen dilutions or Tris ACM buffer for control wells in all desired wells. The release plate was then ready for use. Heparinized blood from a subject patient was obtained and mixed 1 1 with Tris ACM buffer each plate required about 2.5 ml blood mixed with 2.5 ml of Tris ACM . A monoclonal anti histamine antibody horseradish peroxidase conjugate was prepared by the periodate borohydride coupling method described by Paul Nakane, in The data shown in Table I were obtained by the above described histamine release assay from a blood sample taken from a patient clinically known to be sensitive to Timothy grass extract. This blood sample was challenged with various dilutions of Timothy grass extract and the amount of histamine released was determined by reference to a histamine standard curve as described above.
