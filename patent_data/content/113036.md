# METHOD FOR MAKING BISPHENOL CATALYSTS

## Abstract
A method is provided for making sulfonated aromatic organic polymers having aminoorganomercaptan groups attached to backbone sulfonyl radicals by covalent nitrogen sulfur linkages. These sulfonated aromatic organic polymers can be used as an ion exchange resin for making bisphenols.
