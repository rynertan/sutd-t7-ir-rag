## Description
Program composing method This invention relates generally to a method. for composing a program which allows a user with limited programming experience to generate syntactically correct higher order language test programs and, particularly, to a method for composing a program which allows the user to obtain syntactically correct specifications, procedures, programs and. formal test requirements documentation by supplying test data input in a form natural to his environment. The traditional approach to the preparation of higher order language test specifications, test procedures and test programs requires several phases including a manual coding phase, a keypunch terminal input phase and a syntax check and compilation phase. Experience shows that statement syntax, program structure and automatic test equipment ATE usage errors are incurred by even the most experienced test programmers prior to the syntax check and compilation phase.For example, six to ten corrective iterations are typically required to produce a syntactically correct higher order language source. Likewise the preparation of test requirements documents are also tedious, time consuming and subject to many iterations of review and corrections. Traditional higher order language programming involves relatively high initial costs for training test oriented personnel in the higher order language formats and programming rules keypunch terminal support costs the need for rapid and easy access to reference material or prior sections of a test specification, test procedure or test program and iterative processing time and costs for producing syntactically correct source code. These costs repeat for subsequent updates during program validation and later program modifications, and hence add to already high programming costs. The present invention overcomes the disadvantages of traditional higher order language programming by providing a higher language program composing method which can be used by personnel with limited programming experience to generate syntactically correct higher order language. test programs. According to the invention there is provided a program composing method comprising the steps of writing the program specification on forms in a user oriented, format entering said forms into a program composing terminal for processing said forms and for generating an initial version of a program sequence storing said initial version of the program sequence reviewing said program specifica tion and the stored initial version of the program sequence utilizing the results of the review for generating a particularly oriented syntactically correct higher order language program editing said higher order language program and optionally storing the edited higher order language program and transmitting said program for utilization. The manner of carrying out the invention is described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings in which FIGURE 1 is a flow diagram showing the use of the invention during a macro program development cycle FIGURE 2 is a flow diagram showing the use of the invention during a unit under test UUT program development cycle FIGURE 3 is a block diagram showing the key elements of software of the invention FIGURE 4 is a diagrammatic representation showing a structural arrangement of the major hardware components used for carrying out the invention and FIGURE 5 is a flow diagram illustrating the use of the program composing terminal system for carrying out the invention. There is described herein a program composing terminal system for carrying out the invention which accepts test data inputs in a user oriented format and, in turn, generates a machine independent and syntax correct higher order language source for providing an easy to use, automatic test equipment ATE oriented program creation. facility. In addition, the same data inputs are. used to produce a test requirements document. The fundamental objectives of the program composing method according to the invention are to shorten the. unitunder test UUT test specification development to an ATE program development cycle to eliminate restriction to spe civic ATE or test language, to speed training of novice test programming personnel to maximize programmer productivity, to produce syntax correct test code and to enable traceability and configuration control between test programs and test re requirements documents. This program composing method has two major capabilities that shorten the UUT Test Specification Development to ATE program development cycle. The first capability is a language independent capability that allows design test personnel to generate lists of stimuli, loads, measurements, limits and diagnostic paths without being encumbered by language structure rules and syntax restrictions. The second capability is an interactive ATE oriented program development cycle which features tools that minimize the data keystrokes that must be inputed by a test programmer. FIGURE 1 is a flow chart which shows the use of a program composing terminal 1 during a macro program development cycle. This cycle starts at 2 with design test personnel writing, for example, a test specification as an input on simple test specification forms, as at 4. These forms can then be entered on line into program composing terminal 1 via a keyboard 6 and display screen CRT 8, or, alternatively can be put on punched cards 9 or perforated tape 11 via keypunch or tape perforation means 10 off line and entered in batch mode into the program composing terminal as shown by the dashed lines in the Figure. Program composing terminal 1 processes this data and generates a preliminary version of a test sequence at 12.The preliminary test sequence can be in the. form of lists or, alternatively, can be placed on cards 14, perforated tape 16, or. floppy discs 18, as shown by. the dashed lines in. the Figure, for recall during the program development cycle. FIGURE 2 is a. flow chart which shows. the use of program composing terminal 1 during a test program deve lopment cycle. During. this cycle, the. test programmer at 7 uti lizes test specification form 4 provided as heretofore described with reference to FIGURE 1 to input test data which are stored by the program composing terminal system. Using the stored input test dat a, terminal 1 is used to automatically generate the ATE oriented test program at 20. This program can be listed or stored in. floppy discs 22. Additionally, the terminal can optionally send the program to the ATE via a phone link 24 or hard wired modem 26. Alternatively, the test program can be carried to the ATE via perforated tape 28 or cards 30. There are three kinds of users for the program composing terminal systems for carrying out the invention.First, there are design test engineers who specify stimuli, measurements, connections, limits and diagnostic tabs for the units under test UUT s . The second kind of user is a test programmerftest engineer who relates the required testing to the automatic test equipment ATE and its unique language and hardware resources. Finally, the third kind of user is the system programmer compiler writer who creates the data base that makes the terminal serve the other users. Each user has a unique task to perform and the program composing terminal system for carrying out the invention provides an interface designed to meet the specialized user needs. The interface for the design test engineer is test specification form 4 referred to in connection withFIGURES 1 and 2. A major feature of this interface is that .the preliminary test sequence lists will be expanded automatically into the repetitious program sequences required by the ATE languages. The expansion occurs when the test programmers test engineers create the final program. The interface for the test programmers test engineers physically includes a keyboard and a pair of cathode ray tube CRT screens. This interface includes the following software tools in the code creation mode 1. Systems Menus these are self explanatory lists of software tools available on the ter minal. 2. Help File this is a data base that consists of clarification, notes, and hints for all users. 3. Language Menus these are lists pf the verbs available in the currently loa ded language set s. 4. Fill in Prompts these are systems responses that guide the programmer in the creation of language statements. The prompts are used with displayed input. forms or language syntax diagrams. 5. Error Messages these are flags that alert the user to an invalid action and allow for on the spot correction. 6. Editing operations these help to make changes to the current or existing programs. In this con nection, existing programs may be retrieved and edited. 7. Scrollable source this allows the programmer to look back at the earlier portions of his code. The system programmer compiler writer will interface physically through the keyboard and the two CRT sdreens.Software tools and features avail able in a data base creation mode include 1. Syntax Diagram Drawing Tools these are identi fication and reference box drawings, line draw ings and other tools that combine an unambiguous definition of language sets. 2. Menu Creation this tool is used also in the construction of language specific menus. 3. Help. file creation this Tool maintains the help files. Standard editing features are pro vided. There are two means of communication with the ATE 1. On Line In this mode the programmer can send, via telephone or modem, ATE oriented language or a full higher order language to the test station for compilation and error analysis look ing for omissions rather. than syntax errors and then generating the executable code . The ATE can return the results of this analysis or pro vide printed outputs. There is also the ability to request retrieval of a program from the ATE s memory stor age unit MSU request a compilation or request a listing. 2. Qff line In this mode, floppy discs, perforated tape or any other viable output media are taken to. the ATE for analysis. The primary objective of the program composing terminal system for carrying out. the invention are the following 1. It shall be a RESPONSIVE SYSTEM that encourages increased programmer productivity. The system characteristics that will make this feature possible are a. Maximum delay of 2 seconds between keystroke and screen update except where incremental processing is not possible and mass storage accesses are unavoidable . b. Incremental processing will be used e.g. maintain and update alternative screens in memory anticipating most probable operator actions . c. Ideally, the system should not operate at a speed that slows a typical programmers thought process i.e., it should react so that he can run the system and not get ahead of the system . 2. It shall provide a CODE CREATION MODE that func tions at a rate greater than a programmer work ing at a standard terminal, using an interactive compiler. The system will be constructed so that an experienced programmer should be able to pro duce code with forty percent of the number of keystrokes required for a standard terminal, using an interactive compiler. 3. It shall include a TEACHING CAPABILITY that speeds training of new programmers while assur ing almost immediate productivity. This feature shall be incorporated so that a. These of a manual to learn how to operate the terminal should be virtually eliminated by the. utilization of self explanatory menus and reference text. b. The .inexperienc ed programmer can opt to be guided. through the syntax of each state ment. c. Statement numbering should be automatic or manual with automatic incrementing. d. Report titles should be. user definable. 4. It shall provide a macro preprocessor that speeds the test specifieation development to ATE program development cycle. This should permit the follow ing a. Test specification writing by using a. form fillout technique that is, to the maximum extent possible, free of higher order lan guage constraints and extraneous words. b. Conversion of test specifications to valid source code to the maximum extent possible with the elimination of needless human entry of repetitive sequences e.g., often tests are apply measure verify sequences done many times over with. different stimulus output connection values . The best option would be to add an array processor to the higher order language. The terminal will compensate for this deficiency of test languages by genera ting the apply measure verify sequences from tables of stimulus output connection values. The chart of FIGURE 3 shows the key elements of software of the invention and the kind of activity assigned to each task. Thus, the real time monitor task at 32 has the assigned activity of queuing, scheduling, input output handling and utility support of applications tasks. The languagegram or wordgram file task at 34 has the assigned activity of creating, deleting, modifying, retrieving and displaying. functions for higher order language languagegrams. While. the higher order language data base task at 36 has the assigned activity of creating, deleting, modifying, retrieving and displaying functions for the higher order language core and subsets. The help, file task at 38 provides all necessary handshaking for interfacing to the ATE at 40. It schdules the necessary tasks. for incoming messages. The menu task at 42 is basically a tree structure that leads to the scheduling of an application task. It allows for rapid access by the experienced user while allowing the new user to find his way. The template fill in that at 44 has the assigned activity of an editing and limiting check for input data to fill in higher order language statements. Selection of these statements is also accomplished by this task. The macro preprocessor Task at 46 has the assigned activity of managing the data to be inputed from test specification forms 4, shown in FIGURES 1 and 2. The optional peripherals Task at 48 has the assigned activity of managing data for all optional peripherals such as card readers, tape punchers and tape readers. FIGURE 4 shows the structural configuration of the major hardware components of the program composing terminal system for carrying out the invention This structure includes a programmer unit 50 including a micro computer featuring a central processing unit CPU and associated memory. The operating system has real time, executive control and memory resident applications. The programmer unit should be of sufficient size and have sufficient speed to manage all system activities without swapping or overlaying. Preferably, it has an autoload feature and power fail protection. A local memory unit 52 features dual floppy discs storing current language definitions and source program. The local memory unit must have adequate space for a memory resident module, the currently applicable higher order language subset and HELP data bases. A pair of cathode ray tube CRT screens 54 and 56 are provided. Both screens are of the touch sensitive type.Screen 54 is a working screen which will speed the use of self teaching menus by a programmer. The fill in template or form will appear on this screen. Screen 56 is a reference screen which provides the capability of reviewing earlier portions of. the program. under development, examining reference material such as languagegrams and viewing aids, hints and advices from the HELP function of the system. Touch sensitive screens 54 and 56 may be of the commercially available type, having twenty four lines on the display disposed in relation to touch sensitive pads as is well known in the art. The use of touch sensitive screens for both the working and reference displays minimizes the number of special keys required on a custom keyboard 58 and limits the needed eye movements of. the. user. Custom keyboard 58 provides the ability to manage the cursor on both CRT screens 54 and 56, scroll the reference screen with single keystrokes and use standard units such as seconds, volts, counts, etc., with single keystrokes. Custom keyboard 58 may be a standard typewriter type keyboard which should have special key caps that allow single stroke entry of standard terms. Two cursor control pads should be available on the keyboard to manage the cursor for each of the screens 54 and 56. A separate number pad for ease in entering numeric strings should be provided, as well as a system control function for giving the operator access to system function such as the main directory without losing current activities. A phone link 60 to the main computer not shown allows down loading of higher order language subsets associated languagegrams and HELP function data bases, transmission of syntax correct higher order language to the main computer and receipt of message and data regarding compilations from the main computer. Optional hardware, not shown, but. usable with the invention as will be understood by those skilled in the art, includes a printer. for printing data from cards or tapes a card reader that can be. used to input cards from an off line keypunch operation for test specificaction a tape punch that can be used. to input source data to ATE s not attached to the program composing terminal a. tape reader that can be. used to input tape from an off line tape punch operation. for test specification and a magnetic cassette or cartridge having a function similar to the tape punch and tape recorder. With reference to FIGURE 5, which illustrates the use of the program composing terminal system for carrying out the invention, a sequence is started with the system in a power on condition via 62 and parametric data set into the system at 64. Language base or program generation is accomplished via 66 in response to languagegrams, fill in forms, menus and help files, collectively referred to as data sets. Creation editing of the data sets is accomplished at 68. Program composition is accomplished by setting initializing parameters at 70 and composing or editing at 72, including retrieving and editing existing programs. Edited programs are transmitted via 74 to phone link 60 for communication with the main computer as aforenoted and lists may be provided at 76 leading to program creation at 80. With the program created at 80, an inexperienced user sequence includes menu prompting at 82 and fill in forms at 84 in response to standard test library 86 and forms file 88 inputs leading to a completed form at 90 or a source program at 92. An experienced user sequence includes languagegram follow and fill in at 94, menu prompting at 96, fill in languagegrams at 98 and program composing at 100.
