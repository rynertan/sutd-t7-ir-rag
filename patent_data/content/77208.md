# Apparatus for intermittently dispensing a liquid additive into a flowing liquid stream.

## Abstract
Apparatus 10 for automatically dispensing a liquid treat ment chemical 12 from a replaceable supply bottle 14 into an intermittently flowing liquid stream 22 such as a recirculat ing water supply for a refrigeration system. The apparatus has a feeder chamber 16 into which the liquid stream 22 flows which is periodically emptied by a siphon tube 18 when the li quid reaches a level sufficient to establish a siphon effect in the siphon tube 18 . The rising level of liquid 22 in the chamber 16 also actuates, by means of a float 24 , the valve portion 31 of a closure assembly 30 on the inverted top of the sup ply bottle 14 . The valve portion 31 is fed by a capillary tube 50 and dispenses a predetermined, very small quantity of chemical each time it is actuated. The valve portion 31 is pre vented from becoming clogged by chemical crystals during in active periods by being mounted so that its surface will be flushed each cycle by the water 22 which rises in the feeder chamber 16 .
