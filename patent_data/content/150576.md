# Optical actuator.

## Abstract
An arrangement for the remote actuation of a controlled device, e.g. a hydraulic valve, in situations with stringent safety requirements, uses optical power. The optical power, e.g. from a high power laser, is conveyed via an optical fibre 1 to the controlled device. Here it falls on a heat absorbent surface 2 , as a result of which a volatile fluid e.g. freon is evaporated. This via a bellows 4 drives an output rod 6 , which operates the controlled device. Alternatives include a bimetallic strip, a thermostat type capsule, and a memory metal strip, as the heat responsive de vice.
