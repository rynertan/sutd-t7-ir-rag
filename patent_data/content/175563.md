# Apparatus for providing oscillating contaminant removal stream.

## Abstract
For removal of the contaminant deposits from a surface such as a tube sheet 13 of a vertical tube heat exchanger, as in a nuclear steam generator, having plural spaced heat ex change tubes 16 connected to the tube sheet, a lance 30 is radially moved along the tube sheet between parallel rows of tubes. The lance carries a nozzle 40 for ejecting a stream 55 of high pressure cleaning fluid toward the sludge deposits, the nozzle acting cyclically to sweep the stream throughout a range of directions centered about the nozzle axis 54 . The nozzle includes means for deflecting the cleaning fluid stream, about the central discharge axis.
