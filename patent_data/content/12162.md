# A method for the treatment of reducible hydrocarbon containing aqueous streams.

## Abstract
A new, economical system for removal of persistant reducible organic compounds from aqueous streams by passing the stream, preferably at or near neutral pH, through a column 34 containing a metal reductant 36 catalyzed to provide efficient and economical reduction or dechlo rination of a variety of pesticides and other compounds such as PCB or chloroform. The system is especially use ful to reduce the level of soluble, reducible hydrocarbons in very dilute waste streams 1 ppm or less generally by 99 or more.
