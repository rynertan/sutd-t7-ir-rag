# Band feeding and tightening apparatus.

## Abstract
A band feeding and tightening apparatus for a band strapping machine comprises a main shaft rotatably placed at a lateral position of a serial connection of a motor and a reduction gear device a high speed revolution transmitting means to transmit a rotational force at the high speed side of the reduction gear device to the main shaft a low speed revolution transmitting means to transmit a rotational force at the low speed side of the reduction gear to the main shaft through an electromagnetic clutch a sationary shaft placed in parallel to the main shaft, the stationary shaft rotatably supporting a feed roller and a power transmitting means to transmit a rotational foce of the high speed revolution transmitting mean to the feed roller through a friction clutch and the return roller mounted on the main shaft through a one way clutch.
