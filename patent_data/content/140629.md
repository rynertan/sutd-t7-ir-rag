# Decaffeination with treated activated carbon.

## Abstract
An aqueous coffee extract is decaffeinated with a treated activated carbon. The activated carbon is first con tacted with an ethyl cellulose solution in order to adsorb the ethyl cellulose on the carbon. The ethyl cellulose containing activated carbon is then dried and contacted with an aque ous coffee extract. The substantially decaffeinated extract is subsequently separated from the carbon.
