## Description
This invention relates to stators for electric motors in which the stator core consists of a stack of laminations shaped to provide the required number of poles separated by intervening slots in which are wound coils of wire which provide the stator windings, the invention being especially applicable to salient pole electric motors. The coils of wire are usually insulated from the stator core by means of liners formed from strips of paper or like material of the appropriate length introduced into the respective slots before the winding on of the coils. An object of the invention is to provide a stator having an alternative form of slot insulation which has advantages over the use of such conventional strip liners, as will be apparent from the following description. According to the invention a stator for an electric motor comprises a stator core consisting of a stack of laminations shaped to provide a plurality of poles separated by intervening slots, and a pair of moulded plastics insulator elements each comprising an annular support carrying a plurality of hollow projections corresponding in number and cross section to the said slots, the projections of the two elements fitting into the slots from opposite ends, with the supports abutting the respective ends of the stack and opposed projections engaging telescopically one within the other so as to provide insulating liners extending the length of the slots, adjoining projections at the outer end of each element being interconnected by a transverse web which extends across the face of the pole between the projections, such th√°t the sides and end of each pole are surrounded by a casing of plastics material around which the respective coil is wound. Such an arrangement has the advantage that it renders cunvenie7 it the uce of sb dRrd joiner elements for cores utiiisir the same form of stator laminations, but having different axial lengths, by varying the amount by which the projections of the two elements are telescoped within one another. The elements are conveniently held in position on the stator by the coils when the latter have been wound on to the respective poles. The projections are conveniently formed with slots which align with the mouths of the slots between adjoining poles to permit the coils of wire providing the stator windings to be wound on to the poles utilising known winding techniques. A further advantage of the invention is that the fitting of the elements is simplified compared with the insertion of separate insulating strips into the individual stator slots, and moreover since the sides and ends of the poles are surrounded by a casing of plastics material, the thickness of which can readily be controlled during the moulding process, the risk of insulation breakdown between the coils and the stator core is significantly reduced. Conveniently all the projections of one of the elements are arranged to fit within corresponding projections of the other element, although in some cases some of the projections of one element may be arranged to fit within respective projections of the other element, with the remaining one or more projections of the latter arranged to fit within the corresponding projection of the first element. The stator laminations are preferably secured together, as by welding or other known technique, to form a rigid stack before the fitting of the insulator elements. The invention includes within its scope electric motors having stators with moulded plastic slot liners as above, escribed. One stator in accordance with the invention for use in a salient pole electric oor will now be described, by way of exgnple, with reference toFigures 1 to 4 of the accompanying schematic drawing, in which Figure 1 represents an end view of the stator core showing the shape of the stator laminations, Figure 2 represents a perspective view of the stator, Figure 3 shows the inner end of one of two plastics liner elements employed in the stator, and Figure 4 represents a side view of the two elements prior to insertion into the stator core. Referring first to Figures 1 and 2, the motor stator comprises a core 1 formed by a stack of similarly shaped steel laminations 2, each consisting of a ring 3 with inwardly directed projections 4, such that when the laminations are assembled to form a stack they provide a substantially cylindrical shell 3.1 carrying a plurality of poles 4.1, for example four as shown, the laminations being secured together as by welding or in any other convenient manner. The inwardly facing surfaces 4.2 of the poles 4.1 provide a substantially cylindrical bore broken by slots 5 formed by the gaps between adjacent poles. The width of the poles is greatest adjacent the surfaces 4.2 and decreases towards the shell 3.1, the poles being joined to the shell by narrow necks 6. Accordingly the slots 5 have a relatively small transverse dimension between the pole surfaces 4.2 and open out into wider regions 7 as shown. The poles 4.1 are Vuwd, in ,known,manner, with wire coils 8, which are insulated from the stator core, in accordance with the invention, by an insulator assembly comprising two se a rate elements 11, 12, the construction of which is shown more clearly in Figures 3 and 4. Each element is formed of moulded plastics material and comprises a supporting ring 13 carrying four projections 14 shaped so that they fit closely within the wider parts 7, of the slots 5, the projections being slid into the respective slots from opposite ends of the stack of laminations 2 before the winding on of the coils 8, the latter then serving to hold the elements in position. Adjacent projections 14 on each element are connected by generally flat webs 15 lying perpendicular to the axis of the element, and serving to insulate the coils 8 from the ends of the poles 4.1, flanges 16 which project axially outwards from the radially inner edges of the webs 15 supporting the ends of the coils 8 against radially inward movement. The end parts of the projections 14 on one of the elements, for example 11, are of such dimensions that they are a telescopic fit within corresponding projections of the other element 12, such that the elements are capable of being used with different stator stacks of the same radial dimensions but different axial lengths. Moreover as only two insulating elements need to be handled, the assembly of the stator is simplified compared with the manufacture of stators requiring separate slot liners of strip form for the individual slots.
