# Chemical milling using an inert particulate and moving vessel.

## Abstract
Thin edged workpieces are chemically milled to remove material uniformly from their surfaces by tumbling the workpieces in a barrel in which is contained a sufficient volume of inert polymer particulate media. Titanium airfoils for turbomachinery are able to have an oxidized surface layer removed without suffering small nicks and other damage to their critically shaped edges.
