## Description
The present invention relates to a pilferproof closure for a container. The object of the present invention is to provice a pilfer proof closure for a container of the type having an aperture, the closure being insertable into the aperture. Accordingly, the present invention provides a closure for a container having a sleeve element insertable into an aperture in the container and having a pouring bore, a plug element insertable into the pouring bore for closing the container, and lifting means operably associated with said plug element for opening the same, characterized by frangible pilfer indicating means between at least one of said elements and said lifting means adapted to break apart attendant to lifting of said lifting means. The pilferage indicator of the invention is associated with the lifting means or opening lever structure such that once the lever is lifted, it breaks apart a readily apparent nonrepairable frangible tie or tether of the indicator and forms a hole through the center of the lever. Tampering is thus readily evident.The lever may also be formed to spring up when it is broken away from the indicator and thus the apparent tapering is more readily perceivable by the customer. The construction also preferably provides a wide latitude to accommodate movements such that the pilfer indicia is not accidentally or prematurely broken. The closure of the invention may be easily manufactured in a simple single molding operation and may be machine molded and the lever portion thereof tethered. in conjunction with. the anti pilfer structure prior to assembly with the container. These and other features inherent in the invention will become more apparent from the specification and the drawings wherein Figure 1 is a perspective view of a container with a closure incorporating the invention Figure 2 is an enlarged top plan view Figure 3 is a cross sectional view taken substantially on line 3 3 of Figure 2 Figure 4 is a view similar to Figure 3 but showing the parts with. the pilfer indicator broken preparatory to opening the closured Figure 5 shows the parts reclosed and Figure 6 is an enlarged top plan view of a por tidn of the handle showing the pilferproof structure Figure 7 is a cross sectional view of the closure and a portion of the container taken substantially on line 7 7 of Figure 9 showing the pilfer indicator unbroken Figure 8 is a cross sectional view the same as Figure 7 showing the parts with the pilfer indicator broken Figure 9 is a fragnentary top plan view Figure 10 is an enlarged fragmentary top plan view and Figure. 11 is a section on line 11 11 of Figure 10. The invention is shown applied to a container 2 made of metal such as aluminum and comprising a cylindrical body 3 with an integral outwardly convexed bottom 5 which is provided with outwardly protruding dimples 6 upon which the container rests. It will be understood that the invention is applicable to other types of containers. The upper open end portion of the body 3 has a necked in portion 9 which fits into an annular skirt portion 10 of a dome member 12 which forms the upper end of the container. A suitable adhesive 13 bonds the portion 9 to the skirt 10. The dome member 12 is formed with a stepped neck 14 Figure 3 and a toroidal section 18. The member 12 provides at the upper end of the container on neck 14 a shoulder 20 and an access opening 22, the neck 14 terminating in a curl 24. A plastic closure 25 is provided at the upper end of the container and comprises a tubular neck or sleeve portion 26, a closure plug portion 28 Figure 4 and a venting portion 30 to which is attached a finger grip lever or handle 32. The neck portion 26 is a clyindrical member which at its lower end is tapered at 36 and is tightly wedged through the opening 22 Figure 3 and then expands radially outwardly and engages its shoulder 38 under the lower edge of shoulder 20 of the neck 14. The neck portion 26 has an upper outwardly projecting annular flange 40 which engages the top edge of the curl 24 and provides a fluid tight pressure seal with the shoulder 38. The interior bore surface 50 Figure 4 of the neck portion 26 provides a pour and fill opening within which there is located a locking ring member or annular shoulder 52 with a bottom locking surface 60 which extends normal to the axis of the neck portion. The plug 28 has a cylindrical side wall 65 which adjacent to its lower edge is provided with an annular locking ring or rib 66 which is of generally triangular cross section having a lower downwardly tapered pilot surface 67 which is adapted to be guided with the inner face 56 of th neck or sleeve locking ring 52 when the plug or cap is pressed into the neck opening or bore 50 whereupon the apical edge 68 on ring 66 is deflected and the locking ring or shoulder 66 on the cap or plug slips under the shoulder 52 of the neck and a flat radially outwardly extending surface 69 at the upper side of the shoulder 66, normal to the axis of the neck or sleeve, locks under the face 60. The plug portion or cap 28 has a top wall 70 integral with the upper end of the plug 28, the wall 70 extending beyond the perimeter of the plug and forms an annular rim portion 72 which on its underside is pressed in position against the top surface 75 of the annular flange 40 integral with and extending radially outwardly from the upper end of the neck portion 26. The bottom side 77 of flange 40 presses against the crest 78 Figure 5 of the curl 24 of the metal neck 14. A tether in the form of a narrow strap 80 connects a peripheral edge of flange 72 with a peripheral edge of portion 40 of the neck member 26. The wall 70 is provided close to its marginal edge with a vent opening 84 in an area diametrically opposite to the tether 80 adjacent to the interior surface of the wall 65 of the plug. A frusto conical pilot cavity 86 is formed at the upper end of opening 84 for guiding the male venting closure pin or element 30 which in the closed position extends into the opening 84. The upper end of the closure element or vent pin 30 depends from and is integrally connected with the handle or lever member 32 intermediate its ends. The handle or lever 32 has a fulcrum end 96 which engages with the top edge the thickened portion of a combination pouring lip and fulcrum rim 97 formed on the top side of the flange 40. The lever 32 is connected below the fulcrum end 96 to one end of a narrow strap 108 which is folded and which has its other end connected to the outer edge of flange 72 in an area diametrically opposite the strap 80. A pilferproof structure 150 is provided which comprises a post 152 which is formed integral with the top wall 70 and projects upwardly thereform through an opening and is heat bonded to a disk 156 which is formed in the intermediate portion 158 of the handle 32 in the plane thereof. The disk 156 is connected by a series of frangible straps or tethers 162 to the depressed body edge section 164 of the handle portion 158. The handle has a peripheral reinforcing rib 160 and a lift tab 161 facilitating entry of a finger thereunder. Thus, to open the closure shown closed inFigure 3, the user lifts on portion 161 diametrically opposite the strap 108 and breaks the straps 162 and lifts the fulcrum end portion 96 outwardly and withdraws the vent plug 30 from opening 84. Continued rotation of the lever or handle engages the fulcrum portion 96 against the rim or ledge 97 and further pivotal movement rightwardly Figures 3 and 4 pries the plug 28 out of the sleeve 26.Removal of the pin or plug 30 enhances the flexibility of wall 70 and the plug wall 65 in the immediate area and thus the flexure of that portion of the wall 65, that is, in the region of the vent opening whereby as the lever is fulcrummed, it pulls on the tether 108 which, in turn, curls the adjacent portion 72 of the top wall 70 upwardly and causes the portion of the wall 70 contiguous to the vent opening to warp radially inwardly thus facilitating partially unhooking of the ledge or shoulder 66 from under the shoulder 52 and disengaging the locking face 69 from face 60. The plug 28 then easily lifts out of the neck or sleeve opening and with the handle or lever portion 30 lays to one side of the pour opening 50 and may be grasped by the user so as not to obstruct pouring. To reclose the closure, the olua 28 of the closure is pressed into the sleeve opening until the shoulder 52 snaps under the shoulder 66. Then the handle or lever is folded over the cap 28 and the vent plug or pin 30 is pressed into the yent opening 84. Since the pilferindicating straps 162 have been broken, it will be apparent to the observer that there is a strong probability that the closure has been previously opened. However, the pilferproof feature in no way interferes with the reclosing of the closure. The handle or lever 32 is so molded that when tacked down as in Figure 3, it is stressed and biased upwardly so that when released by breaking stops 162, it will assume the position shown in Figure 5 which brings attention to the possible pilfering. On Figures 7 11, is shown a further embodiment of the invention applied to a container 2 fragmentarily shown made of aluminum but which may be made of any other material. The upper open end portion of the container has a dome memb.er 12 which is formed with a stepped neck 14.The neck 14 provides a shoulder 20 and an access opening 22. The neck 14 terminates in a curl 24 at its upper end. A closure 25 made of plastic material is provided at the upper end of the container and comprises a tubular neck or sleeve portion 26, a closure plug portion 28 and a venting portion 30 to which is attached a finger grip lever or handle 32. The neck portion 26 is a cylindrical member which at its lower end is tapered at 36 and is tightly wedged through the opening 22 Figure 9 and then expands radially outwardly and engages its shoulder 38 under the lower edge of shoulder 20 of the neck 14. The neck portion 26 has an upper outwardly projecting annular flange 40 which engages the top edge of the curl 24 and provides a fluid tight pressure seal with the shoulder 38. The interior bore sufrace 50 of the neck portion 26 provides a pour and fill opening within which there is located a locking ring member or annular shoulder 52 with a bottom locking surface 60 which extends normal to the axis of the neck portion. The plug 28 has a cylindrical side wall 62 which, adjacent to its lower edge, is provided with an annular locking ring or rib 66 which is of generally triangular cross section having a lower downwardly tapered pilot surface 67 which is adapted to be guided with the inner face 56 of the neck or sleeve locking ring 52 when the plug or cap is pressed into the neck opening or bore 50 whereupon the apical edge 68 on ring 66 is deflected and the locking ring or shoulder 66 on the cap or plug slips under the shoulder 52 of the neck and a flat radially outwardly extending surface 69 at the upper side of the shoulder 66, normal to the axis of the neck or sleeve, locks under the face 60. The plug portion or cap 28 has a top wall 70 integral with the upper end of the plug 28, the wall 70 extending beyond the perimeter of the plug and forms an annular rim portion 72, which on its underside, is pressed in position against the top surface 75 of the annular flange 40 integral with and extending radially outwardly from the upper end of the neck portion 26. The bottom side 77 of the flange 40 presses against the crest 78 Figure 11 of the curl 24 of the metal neck 14. A tether in the form of a narrow strap 80 connects a peripheral edge of flange 72 witch a peripheral edge of portion 40 of the neck member 26. The wall 70 is provided close to its marginal edge with a vent opening 84 in an area diametrically opposite to the tether 80 adjacent to the interior surface of the wall 65 of the plug. A frusto conical pilot cavity 86 is formed at the upper end of opening 84 for guiding the male venting closure pin or element 30 which in the closed position extends into the opening 84. The upper end of the closure element or vent pin 30 depends from and is integrally connected with the lever member 32 intermediate its ends. The lever or handle 32 has a fulcrum end 96 which engages with the top edge the thickened portion of a C shaped combination pouring lip and fulcrum rim 97 formed on the top side of the flange 40.. The lever 32 is connected below the fulcrum end 96 to one end of a narrow strap 108 which is folded and which has its other end connected to the outer edge of flange 72 in an area diametrically opposite the strap 80. In this embodiment there is provided a pilferproof structure 150 which comprises a post 152 which is formed integral with the top wall 70 and projects upwardly therefrom and has an upwardly tapered head and a lower annular shoulder 154. The head is forced through an opening 155 into a cavity 157 formed in an inverted cup shaped socket or receptacle 159 molded on the underside of a disk 156 which is formed in the intermediate portion 158 of the handle or lever 32 in the plane thereof. The disk 156 is connected by a series of frangible straps or tethers 162 to the body edge section 164 of the handle portion 32. The handle or lever has a peripheral reinforcing rib 160 and a lift tab 161 facilitating entry of a finger thereunder.It will be noted that the cup shaped retainer has an annular side wall 158 at the lower edge of which is formed an inturned flange 161 which catches under shoulder 154. It will be seen that there is considerable space between the disk and the bottom flange 161 so that there is vertical play between the head of the rivet and as best seen in Figures 7 and 8, the tab 161 is capable Qf being lifted sufficiently to conveniently admit the finger or thumb of the user without excessive stress beneath the tab 161 such as will not break the straps 162. To open the closure, the lever is lifted breaking the pilfer indicator. The lever is swung over over the fulcrum until the plug is withdrawn from the sleeve. To reclose the closure, the plug 28 of the closure is pressed into the sleeve opening until the shoulder 52 snaps under the shoulder 66. Then the handle or lever is folded over the cap 28 and the vent plug or pin 30 is pressed into the vent opening 84.Since the pilfer indicating straps 162 have been broken, it will be apparent to the observer that there is a strong probability that the closure has been previously opened. However, the pilferproof feature in no way interferes with the reclosing of the closure. The lever is so molded that when attached, as in Figures 7 and 8, it is stressed and biased upwardly and upon its release by straps 162 being broken, it will assume an elevated position which brings attention to possible pilfering.
