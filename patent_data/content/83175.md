# Aluminium treated proteins.

## Abstract
Phytate containing proteinaceous materials are treated with trivalent aluminium to alter the physical, chemical and metabolic functional and nutritional values of the protein. Protein derived from phytate containing seed materials treated with trivalent aluminium possess improved solvent solubility, protease digestibility, reduced thermophiles and trypsin inhibition reduction, low viscosity, trace mineral bioavailability, etc. without requiring phytate or phytic acid removal. The aluminium treatment may be conducted at numerous protein manufacturing stages with a wide variety of different materials. Phytate containing proteins may be effectively extracted at acid pH levels in the presence of trivalent without sacrificing recoverable protein yields.
