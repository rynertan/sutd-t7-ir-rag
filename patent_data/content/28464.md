# Azo dyestuff preparation by phase transfer catalysed coupling in a two phase medium.

## Abstract
Azo dyestuffs from difficult coupling components such as diphenylamine, carbazole and N ethylcarbazole are prepared by conducting the coupling reaction in a mixture of water and a water immiscible polar aprotic solvent in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst which contains an anionic water solubilising group.

## Description
This invention relates to azo dyestuff preparation by phase transfer catalysed coupling in a two phase medium. Certain coupling components react in the azo coupling reaction only with difficulty even with highly active diazonium compounds under the conventional aqueous reaction conditions. It has now been found that the rate at which these difficult coupling components will react with diazoniun compounds in the azo coupling reaction can be greatly increased by conducting the coupling in a two phase system in the presence of a suitable phase transfer catalyst According to the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of azo dyestuffs which comprises reacting together an amino coupling component which is free from ionic water solubilising groups, and a diazonium compound, in a mixture of water and a waterimmiscible polar aprotic solvent and in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst which contains an anionic watersolubilising group. The coupling components to which the above process is applicable are those which contain an amino group and are so hydrophobic and or of such low reactivity that they do not react satisfactorily with diazonium compounds under conventional aqueous azo coupling conditions. Attempts to increase the rate of coupling, for example1 by raising the reaction temperature, usually result in decomposition of the diazonium compound, and the azo dyestuff, if obtained at all, is usually contaminated with the by products of this decomposition. In using the expression amino coupling component we include carbocyclic coupling compounds in which a primary, secondary or tertiary amir,o group is attached directly to the carbocyclic ring and heterocyclic coupling compounds having a ring nitrogen atom which gives rise to a excessive heterocycle, i.e. a heterocycle susceptible to electrophilic substitution. Examples of coupling components which participate only with difficulty in conventional azo coupling reactions and to which the present process is applicable areN ethylcarbazole1 carbazole, diphenylamine and N ethyl Nbenzylaniline. Examples of water immiscible polar aprotic solvents which may be used in the process are dichloromethane, chloroform and nitrobenzene. The phase transfer catalysts which may be used in the process are, for example, compounds containing a hydrophobic group and an acidic group, for example, a carboxylic acid or, preferably, a sulphonic acid group which is ionised at the pH of the coupling reaction. Examples of such compounds are alkali metal salts, for example1 the potassium and especially the sodium salts, of n decanoic acid, didodecylacetic acid, diisopropylnaphthalene sulphonic acid, 4 dodecylbenzenesulphonic acid and dioctylsulphosuccinic acid. Also very effective, but less preferred because of its high cost compared with the compounds mentioned above, is sodium tetraphenyl borate. The relative proportions of water and water immiscible polar aprotic solvent which are used in the process are not critical and may be from 9 1 to 1 9 by volume. It is convenient to use aproxirately equal volumes. The amount of phase transfer catalyst which is used may be from 0.01 to 0.5, preferably from 0.05 to 0.25, equivalent based on its anionic group content with respect to the diazonium compound. The coupling reaction mixture may also be buffered by the addition of, for example, acetic acid, since an increased yield of the desired azo dyestuff may be obtained in this way. The reaction temperature is preferably maintained below that at which decomposition of the diazonium compound occurs, and is conveniently 0 5 C. The temperature will in general not exceed 25or. The diazonium compound which is used may be derived from any amine A NH2 in which A is an optionally substituted including a single carboxylic acid or sulphonic acid substituent aryl or heterocyclic radical. As examples of the optionally substituted aryl radicals represented by A there may be mentioned optionally substituted naphthyl radicals and preferably optionally substituted phenyl radicals, in particular phenyl radicals containing one or more substituents such as chlorine, bromine, cyano, trifluoromethyl, nitro, alkyl such as methyl, alkoxy such as methoxy and ethoxy, alkylsulphonyl such as methylsulphonyl, alkylcarbonyl such as acetyl, acylamino such as acetylamino, phthalyl so as to form an anthraquinone nucleus , alkoxycarbonyl such as methoxycarbonyl and ethoxy carbonyl, and hydroxy and alkoxy substituted derivatives thereof such as ss methoxyethoxycarbonyl, p hydroxyethoxycarbonyl and ss ss ethoxyethoxy ethoxycarbonyl, aminosulphonyl and N alkyl,N,N dialkyl and N phenyl derivatives thereof such as N methylaminosulphonyl, N, N diethylaminosulphonyl, N phenylaminosulphonyl and N ethyl N phenylaminosulphonyl, aminocarbonyl and N alkyl and N,N dialkyl derivatives thereof such as N methylaminocarbonyl and N,N diethylaminocarbonyl, and aminosulphonyloxy and N alkyl andN,N dialkyl derivatives thereof. As examples of optionally substituted heterocyclic radicals represented by A there may be mentioned 2 thienyl, 3 pyrazolyl, 2 or 5 imidazolyl, 3 1,2,4 triazolyl , 5 Cl ,2,3, 4 tetrazolyl , 2 thiazolyl, 5 isothiazolyl, 5 Cl 1214 thiadiazolyl , 2 1,3,4 thiadiazolyl , 3 pyridyl, 2 benzoxazolyl, 2 benzthiazolyl, 3 benz 2, 1 isothiazolyl , 3 indazolyl, 3 thienylC2,3 b pyridine , 3 isothiazolyl 3,4 d pyrimidine , 3 isothiazoly 3,4 b thiophene . The diazotisation of the amine A NH2 may be carried out by methods conventionally used for this reaction. For example1 sodium nitrite optionally in the form of an aqueous solution thereof may be added to a solution or dispersion of the amine A NH2 in a strong inorganic acid or an aqueous solution thereof 1 or to a solution of the amine in acetic acid optionally in admixture with propionic acid, or by stirring the amine with nitrosylsulphuric acid.The resulting solution or dispersion of the diazonium compound is then added to a vigorously stirred mixture of water and water immiscible polar aprotic solvent containing the coupling component and the phase transfer catalyst If desired the progress of the reaction can be followed spectrophotometricafly at the max of the product, or, in certain cases, at the hmax of the protonated dye.When reaction is substantially complete the resulting azo dyestuff may be isolated from the reaction mixture, for example, by distilling or steam distilling out the waterimmiscible polar aprotic solvent which may be re used and separating the dyestuff from the residual aqueous medium by filtration or other conventional means. The invention is illustrated by the followingExamples.Example 1 4 Nitrobenzenediazonium chloride 1.0 m mol in water 50 ml at OC is added to dichloromethane 50 ml , carbazole 2.0 m mol and sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate 0.05 m mol and the mixture is vigorously agitated at OC. The rate of reaction is followed spectrophotometrically and found to be 11.1 x 109 moB dim 3. If the catalyst is omitted the rate is only 1.25 x 109 mols 1 dm 3.Example 2 The procedure described in Example 1 is repeated except that the 2.0 m mol of carbazole are replaced by 2.0 m mol of diphenylamine. The rate of the catalysed reaction is 1830 x 109 mols 1 dm 3. If the catalyst is omitted the rate is only 7.5 x 1o9 mols 1 dm Example 3 A mixture of 4 nitrobenzenediazonium chloride 1 equivalent in water, N ethylcarbazole 2 equivalents in dichloromethane and sodium 4 dodecylbenzenesulphonate 0.2 equivalent is agitated vigorously at 0 C. Colour development is rapid and after 48 hours 3 4 nitrophenylazo N ethylcarbazole is formed in 44 yield. Using dioctylsulphosuccinic acid as the phase transfer catalyst increases the yield to 52 . Attempts to couple 4 nitrobenzenediazonium chloride on to N ethylcarbazole in water acetic acid or water dimethyl formamide were unsuccessful. Thus, after 48 hours, by which time all the diazonium ion had decomposed, the reaction mixture contained largely unreacted coupling component and only a small amount of coloured material. Thin layer chromatographic analysis showed the latter to contain a small amount of the expected azo coupling material together with several other components. Example 4 p Nitroaniline l.38g was dissolved in hot concentrated hydrochloric acid 2.5 ml and ice was added to precipitate the amine. The slurry was cooled to OC and a solution of sodium nitrite 0.7 g in water 5 ml was added. The mixture was stirred for 30 minutes, filtcred and added to a solution ofN ethylcarbazole 2.0 g and sodium dioctylsulphosuccinate 1.1 g in msthylene chloride 50 ml at 000. The mixture was stirred and allowed to warm up to room temperature. After 24 hours no diazonium salt was present and the mixture was allowed to separate into two layers. The aqueous layer was discarded and the solvent was rerr.oved from the methylene chloride layer in a rotary evaporator. The resulting oil was dissolved in toluene 25 ml and the solution wa purified by chromatography on a column of silica gel.The dyestuff was eluted with toluene, the toluene was removed and the residue was recrystallised from light petroleum b.pt.100 120 C to give a red solid 1.2g 35 m.pt. 129 1300C. A second crystallisation gave red crystals of 3 4 nitrophenylazo N ethylcarbazole, m.pt. 168 169 C. C20H16N402 requires C,6,o.76 H,4.65 N, 16.27 . Found C, 69.95 H, 4.90 N, 16.00 . Max.

When the dyestuff in the form of an aqueous dispersion is applied to an aromatic polyester textile material a reddishyellow shade is obtained.Examples 5 to 27 The following table illustrates further preparations of dyestuffs according to the process of the invention, using the procedure described in Example 4.
