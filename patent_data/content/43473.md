## Description
PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF POLYETHYLENEBACK GROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a process for the production of polyethylene and more particularly to an efficient process for the production of polyethylene having a broad distribution of molecular weight by the use of a specific catalyst. Polyethylene has been widely used as an excellent synthetic resin in various applications and in particu lar, polyethylene having a broad distribution of molecular weight has been desired in view of moldability, physical properties of molded article, etc. It is known that polyethylene for the production of a catalyst prepared by reacting a magnesium compound and a titanium halide has a higher activity than the socalled Ziegler catalyst polyethylene. In accordance with the conventional methods of production, if the distribution range of molecular weight of the product polyethylene is sufficiently broad, the catalyst activity will be low. These conventional methods are disadvantageous in that the production efficiency is low and since a large amount of catalyst is required, it is necessary to provide an operation for removal of the catalyst from the polyethylene products. An object of the invention is to provide an efficient process for the production of polyethylene having a broad distribution of molecular weight by the use of a catalyst having high activity. Another object of the invention is to provide a process for the production of polyethylene which does not require a de ash step i.e., a step of removing the catalyst . A further object of the invention is to provide a process for the production of polyethylene having a large apparent density, a relatively uniform particle size, and a very low content of fine powder.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a process for the production of polyethylene which comprises polymerizing ethylene in the presence of a catalyst containing the following Components A and B as effective components A a solid product prepared by reacting i a solid material comprising the reaction product of a a compound containing at least titanium, magnesium and halogen, and b at least one compound selected from the group consisting of tetraalkoxyzirconium, zirconium tetrahalide and tetraaalkoxytitanium, with ii3 a an organoaluminum halide represented by the general formula AlR1nXÚ3 n wherein RÚ is an alkyl group, K is a halogen atom, and 0 n 33 or b a halogen containing titanium compound represented by the general formula Ti oR2 mX24 X2 R2 is an 2 m 4 m wherein R is an alkyl group, K is a halogen atom, and 0 m 4 and B3 an organoaluminum compound. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The catalyst for use in the process of the invention comprises Components A and B as described above. With regard to the compound containing at least titanium, magnesium and halogen which is used for the preparation of Component A , i.e., a solid product, there is no limitation thereto, and various compounds can be used. Suitable examples of the compounds con taining at least titanium, magnesium and halogen include the following solid substances solid substances prepared by reacting inorganic magnesium compounds, such as magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate, magnesium sulfate, and magnesium halide, with titanium halide solid substances prepared by reacting inorganic mag nesium compourds with silicon halide, alcohol and titan ium halide in that order solid substances prepared by reacting dialkoxymag nesium, e.g., magnesium diethoxide, with magnesium sul fate and titanium halide solid substances prepared by reacting precipitates which are formed by reacting Mg O bond containing in organic compounds, such as magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide, and magnesium carbonate, with magnesium sulfate, silicon halide and alcohol in that order, with silicon halide or organosilicon compounds, e.g., SiCl4, CH30StC13, CH30 2SiC12, CH30 3SiCl, Si OCH3 4, C2H5OSiCl3, C2H5O 2SiCl2, C2H5O 3SiCl and Si OC2H5 4 and titanium halide and solid substances prepared by reacting dialkoxymagnesium and an alcohol adduct of magnesium halide, such as MgC12 6C2H50H and treating the reaction product with alcohol, and then by reacting the reaction product thus treated with titanium halide. The solid product, Component A , is prepared by reacting the solid substance as prepared above, i.e., the compound containing at least titanium, magnesium and halogen, with at least one compound selected from the group consisting of tetraalkoxyzirconium, zirconium tetrahalide and tetraalkoxytitanium. Examples of such tetraalkoxyzirconium compounds include tetramethoxyzirconium, tetraethoxyzirconium, tetrapropoxyzirconium and tetrabutoxyzirconium. Of these compounds, tetrabutoxyzirconium is particularly preferred. Examples of zirconium tetrahalide compounds include tetrachlorozirconium and tetrabromozirconium.

The solid product of Component A is usually prepared by reacting the compound containing at least titanium, magnesium and halogen with any one of tetraalkoxyzirconium, zirconium tetrahalide and tetraalkoxytitanium. When the compound is reacted with two or three compounds of tetraalkoxyzirconium, zirconium tetrahalide and tetraalkoxytitanium, the resulting catalyst effectively acts to produce polyethylene having a broader distribution of molecular weight and markedly improved physical properties. The ratio of the compound containing at least titanium, magnesium and halogen to the compound or compounds selected from the group consisting of tetraalkoxytitanium, zirconium tetrahalide and tetraalkoxytitanium is not limited, and a suitable ratio is determined depending on the conditions employed.Usually, based on one mole of titanium atoms contained in the compound containing at least titanium, magnesium and halogen, tetraalkoxyzirconium is added within the range of about 0.1 to 20 moles, preferably about 0.2 to 10 möles,and zirconium tetrahalide or tetraalkoxy titanium are each added within the range of up to about 20 moles, preferably about 0.05 to 10 moles. The foregoing reaction is carried out at a tempera ture of 0 C to about 2000C, preferably about 200C to 1500C, for a period of about 5 minutes to 10 hours, preferably 30 minutes to 5 hours, and preferably, in an inert hydrocarbon solvent, such as pentane, hexane, heptane, oxtane, cyclohexane, benzene and toluene. The thus prepared solid material is fully washed and then is reacted with the organoaluminum halide compound represented by the general formula AlR1nX13 n or the halogen containing titanium compound represented by the general formula Ti OR2 mX24m. of varius organoaluminum halide compounds represented by the foregoing general formula, dimethylaluminum monochloride, diethylaluminum monochloride, diisopropylaluminum monochloride, diisobutylaluminum monochloride, methylaluminum dichloride, ethylaluminum dichloride, isopropylaluminum dichloride, and isobutylaluminum dichloride, and mixtures thereof are preferred.

The amount of the organoaluminum halide compound or halogen containing titanium compound added is usually determined within the range of about 1 to 200 moles, preferably about 10 to lDO moles, per mole of the titanium atom in the solid material described above. The reaction of the solid material and the organoaluminum halide compound or halogen containing titanium compound is performed under the conditions of a tempera ture of O to about 2000C, preferably about 30 to 5DOC and a reaction period of about 5 minutes to 10 hours, preferably about 30 minutes to 5 hours. The reaction can be performed either in an inert hydrocarbon solvent, such as pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, cyclohexane, benzene and toluene, or in a slurry state without the use of a solvent. In the process of the invention, the solid product thus prepared is, if desired, washed and used as Com ponent A of the catalyst. Typical examples of organoaluminum compounds used as component B which constitutes the catalyst for use in the process of the invention include those compounds represented by the general formula AlR3kX33 k wherein 3 3.R is an alkyl group, X is a halogen atom, and O kS3 and by the general formula AlR4i OR5 3 i wherein R4 and R5 are each an alkyl group and Oci 3 .

In accordance with the process of the invention, polyethylene is produced by polymerizing ethylene in the presence of the catalyst containing Components A and B as described hereinbefore as effective components. The ratio of Component A to Component B is not limited. Usually, Components A and B are mixed so that the aluminum atoms in Component B are about 1 to 1,000, preferably about 10 to 500 moles, per mole of the titanium atoms in Component A . The amount of the catalyst comprising Component A and B used can be changed within wide limits and is determined depending on the conditions employed. Usually, it is used in an amount, calculated as the titanium atoms in the Component A , of about 0.001 to 10 millimoles and preferably about 0.005 to 0.5 millimoles, per liter of the reaction system. In producing polyethylene by polymerizing ethylene in accordance with the process of the invention, the catalyst prepared by using Components A and B is added to the reaction system and then ethylene is introduced thereinto. The procedure and conditions of the polymerization are not limited. Any of solution polymerization, suspension polymerization, gas phase polymerization, etc., can be employed. The polymerization can be performed either continuously or discontinuously. As media for the reaction system, inert solvents, such as butane, pentane, hexane, cyclohexane, heptane, benezene and toluene, are preferably used.The polymerization can.be performed under the following conditions ethylene pressure of about 2 to 100 2 2 kg cm , preferably about 5 to 50 kg cm reaction tem perature of about 20 C to 2000C, preferably about 500C to 1500C, and a period of about 5 minutes to 10 hours, preferably about 30 minutes to 5 hours, to thereby produce the desired polyethylene. The regulation of the molecular weight in the polymerization can be carried out by a conventional method, e.g., by the use of hydrogen. The term 11polyethyiene1, as used herein includes copolymers of ethylene with a small amount of an a olefin, as well as homopolymers of ethylene. Some of the major advantages of the process of the invention follow 1 Since the catalyst for use in the process of the invention has high catalytic activity, sufficient effect can be obtained by using only a small amount of the catalyst. This permits omitting the step of removing the catalyst after the completion of polymerization. 2 The polyethylene produced in accordance with the process of the invention has a large apparent density, a uniform particle size, and a very low content of fine powder, and furthermore a broad distribution range of molecular weight. Thus, the polyethylene has very good moldability and excellent physical properties. 3 By appropriately determining the mixing ration of components in the catalyst used, polymerization conditions and so forth, the distribution range of molecular weight of the polyethylene can be controlled within the desired range. Thus, the process of the present invention is very effective. The alkyl groups which are contained in the constituents of component A and component B , e.g. tetraalkoxyzirconium, tetra alkoxytitanium, aluminum halide and titanium halide constituents of component A and of the organoaluminum compound of component B , preferably contain from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and more preferably from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Chlorine and bromine are the preferred halogen constituents of the halide constituents of the catalyst.

At the end of the time, unreacted gases were removed, and the polymer formed was separated and dried.Thus, 225 gram of white polyethylene was obtained. The apparent density of the polyethylene thus produced was 0.29 g cm2, and MI 2.16 and F.R. were 0.50 and 31, respectively.
