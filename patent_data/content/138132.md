# Stabilized moisture curable composition.

## Abstract
A moisture curable composition having an improved storage stability comprising a hydrolyzable silyl group containing vinyl polymer and an orthoacetic acid ester as a stabilizer. The storage stability of the composition contain ing the hydrolyzable silyl group containing vinyl polymer, which is curable in the presence of moisture at low tem peratures, can be remarkably improved by the presence of the orthoacetic acid ester.
