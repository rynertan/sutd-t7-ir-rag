## Description
HYDROHALOGENATION OF CONJUGATED DIENES IN THE PRESENCE OF ORGANIC AMINES BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The invention relates to processes for the hydro halogenation of conjugated diene hydrocarbons. Brief Description of the Prior Art The literature is replete with descriptions of processes for the hydrohalogenation of conjugated dienes. Representative of such descriptions are those found in the U. S. Patents 2,882,323 and 3,016,408 and in British Patent 896,262 see also German Offenlegungsschrift 1,768,544. In the latter patent, hydrohalogenation of butadiene is conducted in the presence of aqueous mixtures including organic amines. The reaction mixtures are corrosive and in some reactions would tend to promote solvolysis. The German Auslegeschrift 1,253,264 describes the hydrochlorination of butadiene in a gas phase reaction. The present invention is an improvement over the prior art processes in that it may be carried out in liquid phases of the reactants, at low temperatures and with minimal solvolysis of products. Improved yields are obtained of the desired products. The present invention is particularly advantageous when used to hydrochlorinate myrcene. Myrcene is a conjugated diene of the formula EMI1.1 When hydrochiorinated in the absence of any catalyst, the major product is myrcenyl chloride.However, the commercially valuable products of myrcene hydrochlorination are the associated co products, namely, geranyl chloride and neryl chloride Hydrochlqrination in the plesence of a copper catalyst shifts the reaction in favor of the desired cc products. It has been postulated that the hydrochlorination of myrcene in the presence of a copper catalyst proceeds according to the reaction scheme EMI2.1 tb SEP partial tb SEP isomerization tb SEP 1 SEP D SEP 0C1 tb SEP A SEP Cl SEP SEP I tb SEP I SEP Cl tb myrcene SEP geranyl SEP neryl SEP linalyl tb SEP chloride SEP chloride SEP chloride tb SEP L SEP 11 SEP III SEP Iv tb SEP Se tb SEP Cm SEP cm tb SEP cnchlerides SEP alpha terpinyl tb SEP chloride tb SEP V SEP VI tb Cyclization may also undesirably occur to form the alpha terpinyl chlorides. When the copper catalyst employed is in the form of cupric chloride CuCl2 the products generally include substantial proportions of linalyl chloride and lesser proportions than the desired geranyl and neryl chlorides. When the copper catalyst is in the form of cuprous chloride, the linalyl chloride product is lessened due, apparently, to partial isomerization to the desired geranyl and neryl chlorides. From the above proposed reaction scheme, it will be appreciated that any process for hydrochlorination of myrcene, to be commercially feasible, must result in a favorable yield of the desired geranyl II and neryl III monochlorides and minimal formation of linalyl IV and alpha terpinyl VI monochlorides. It was previously appreciated that the relative proportions of monochlorides II , III and IV in the hydrochlorination product reaction mixture could be controlled to some degree by I selection of the reaction temperature, gas flowrate andI catalyst concentration. We have now found that when the prior art hydrohalogenation of a conjugated diene, such as the hydrochlorination of isoprene and in particular the hydrochlorination of myrcene, is carried out in the presence of an organic amine, then the isomerization of the allylic chloride products during the hydrohalogenation reaction is shifted to favor formation of the less substituted allylic chloride, being geranyl chloride II and neryl chloride III in the above example. The advantages associated with the improved process of the invention include improved overall yield of the more desirable chloride, for example prenyl chloride from isoprene and neryl and geranyl chlorides from myrcene, and for the latter case, a greater selectivity of the more important geranyl isomer.SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention comprises, in a method for the hydrohalogenation of a conjugated diene which comprises, hydrohalogenating the diene under anhydrous, liquid phase conditions in the presence of a catalytic proportion of a hydrohalogenation catalyst, the improvement which comprises carrying out the hydrohalogenation in the presence of an organic amine. The improved process of the invention may be carried out in a batch or a continuous manner.It is preferred that the amine contains at least 6 carbon atoms whereby especially preferred are trihexylamine, a mixture of tri alkyl amines where the alkyl portion comprises a chain of from eight to ten carbon atoms, trioctylamine, tri tridecyl amine, distearylmethylamine, dihydrogenated tallow methylamine, tridecylamine and tri docecyl amine.Preferred dienes are myrcene, isoprene and ocimene whereby halogen should be chlorine and the cat√Öalyst is a copper catalyst.An improved process is carried out at a temperature of from about 300C to 500C.As catalyst cuprous chloride is preferred.The catalytic proportion of copper catalyst should especially be within a weight range of 0.01 to 10.0 percent of the dry diene.It is preferred to carry out the process for a period of from 3 to 15 hours.Finally the molar ratio of amine to copper catalyst should preferably be within the range of from 0.1 to 5.0.BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The drawing is a schematic representation of a preferred embodiment method of the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION The process of the invention may be employed for the hydrohalogenation of any conjugated diene. Representative of such dienes are myrcene, isoprene, 2 methylpiperylene, beta phellandrene, 2 ethylbutadiene, ocimene, alloocimene, l phenylbutadiene, and the like. The method of the invention is particularly advantageous for the hydrohalogenation of myrcene to obtain the geranyl and neryl halides which are intermediates for the manufacture of commercially valuable geraniol and nerol. When applied to myrcene, the improved method of the invention will increase the overall yield of the geranyl and neryl halides over the prior art processes and will improve selectivity of the ratio of geranyl isomer to the neryl isomer. Commercially available myrcene made by pyrolysis of beta pinene, purified forms of myrcene, and myrcene isolated from natural materials may be provided as the starting material in the preferred process of the invention. The accompanying drawing is a schematic representation of a preferred embodiment method of the invention for the hydrochlorination of myrcene. As shown in the Figure the provided myrcene initially held in tank 10 may be first dried in a conventional salt bed dryer 20 to remove water, as necessary. The dried myrcene is then preferably cooled to a temperature in the range of from about 300C. to about 300C. most preferably circa 100C. in a cooling unit 30. Alternatively, the myrcene may be cooled first and then processed through a salt bed dryer 20 to remove water, Cooling the starting myrcene prior to drying in the salt bed dryer 20 is somewhat advantageous in that pre cooling increases drying efficiency in the salt bed dryer 20. As shown in the Figure the dried and cooled myrcene starting material may be passed into a hydrohalogenation apparatus which comprises in the preferred embodiment a stirred tank reactor 40. In reactor 40, hydrohalogenation of the introduced myrcene is carried out in the presence of a catalytic proportion of a hydrohalogenation catalyst, at a temperature within the range of from about 30 C. to about 500C. preferably at a temperature within the range of from l00C. to 250C., most preferably about 100C. Hydro halogenation may be effected, for example, by reaction of the myrcene with a hydrogen halide like hydrogen chloride or hydrogen bromide, in substantially anhydrous form and under substantially anhydrous conditions, i.e. having less than about 5 water present in the reaction mixture. As shown in the Figure, the preferred hydrohalogenation is with gaseous hydrogen chloride which is introduced as a gas possibly generated in a vaporizer, and then metered into the reactor 40 via appropriate conduits.Advantageously, the hydrogen chloride is metered into the reactor 40 at a rate of from about 2.0 to about 300 gms hour mole of myrcene present in the reactor 40. Preferably, the rate is from about 4.0 to 8.0 gms hour mole of myrcene. The organic amine is introduced into the reactor 40 from fro storage vessel 50. Myrcene, amine, hydrogen chloride and copper catalyst are introduced into the reactor 40 sequentially. Preferably, the reactor 40 after purging with an inert gas such as nitrogen is first charged with the cool myrcene, the copper catalyst, and the organic amine. While cooling and stirring, the hydrogen chloride is added incrementally to the charge. A A wide variety of catalysts for hydrohalogenation of i myrcene are well known and include, for example, any copper compound having a valency of 2 or less, including metallic copper. Any copper compound convertible to the halide such as the bromide, iodide or chloride under conditions of the i reaction may also be used.

The term alkenylene means the divalent moiety obtained on removal of two hydrogen atoms, each from a non adjacent carbon atom of a parent hydrocarbon and includes alkenylene of 3 to 10 carbon atoms, inclusive, such as 1,3 propenylene, 1, 4 butenylene, 1,5 pentenylene, 1,8 octenylene, 1,10 decenylene and the like. The terms substituted hydrocarbyl and substituted alkenylene as used herein mean the hydrocarbyl or alkenylene moiety as previously defined wherein one or more hydrogen atoms have been replaced with an inert group, i.e.a chemical group which does not adversely affect the desired function of the organic amine of formula VII .Representative of such groups are aminophosphino , hydrocarbyl, quaternary nitrogen ammonium , quaternary phosphorus phosphonium , hydroxyl , alkoxy, mercapto , alkyl, halo , phosphate, phosphite, carboxylate groups and the like.

It will be appreciated that under specific conditions of operating the process of the invention, certain of the above described compounds of the formula VII given above have advantages over other compounds of the same genexal formula. Selection of a particular compound VII for use under specific process conditions, for optimum yields may be made by trial and error technique. The organic amine is used in a proportion to isomerize, during the hydrohalogenation reaction, at least some of the more substituted allylic chloride produced in the method of the invention. Such a proportion is generally within the range of from about 0.01 to 10 percent by weight of the diene charge, preferably 0.2 to 2.5 percent. Optimum proportions will depend to some extent upon the amine selected and may be determined by trial and error technique. The controlling reaction rate in the hydrohalogenation process of the invention is the isomerization of the more substituted halide to the desired less substituted halide. This is controlled by residence time in the hydro halogenation reaction zone. We have found that in hydrochlorination of myrcene, the preferred minimum total residence time is within the range of from 3 to 15 hours, and most preferably 5 to 8 hours under the above described operating temperatures. The presence of linalyl chloride in the reaction mixture may be monitored by conventional analytical techniques. Longer residence times in the hydrochlorination reactor may cause a yield loss due to conversion of the monochlorides to alpha terpinyl chloride. Shorter residence times may not be sufficient to isomerize the linalyl chloride to the desired geranyl neryl chlorides. When it has been determined that hydrohalogenation has occurred to a maximum desired point, the hydrohalogenation product mixture is passed from the hydrohalogenation apparatus. The desired hydrohalogenated diene may be separated from the reaction mixture employing conventional and known techniques including washing, decantation, distillation and like techniques.
