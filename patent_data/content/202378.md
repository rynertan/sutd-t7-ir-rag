## Description
The present invention relates to a coin selection apparatus used in an automatic vending machine or a money changing machine. Various coin selection apparatus have been proposed. In one electronic coin selection apparatus, at least two detection coils are arranged in a path of coins and changes of impedances of the detection coils caused when a coin passes therethrough under an influence of electromagnetic fields by the detection coils are detected. The selection system of the apparatus of this type includes a frequency change detection system in which the detection coils are used as oscillation coils and the changes of equivalent inductances caused when the coin passes therethrough are detected as changes of oscillation frequencies, an impedance voltage detection system in which the detection coils are used as oscillation coils and changes of equivalent loss resistances R caused when the coin passes therethrough are detected as changes of resonance circuit impedances, and a system in which a bridge circuit is constructed by the detection coil, a standard impedance element and two other impedance elements and a balance point of the bridge when the coin passes therethrough is detected. In the coin selection, in order to enhance the selection accuracy including the selection of denomination of the coin and ejection of false coin, the above selection systems are combined, or in a single selection system, a plurality of frequencies are set for electromagnetic fields by the detection coils. Fig. 8 shows a configuration of a prior art frequency change detection system. Three detection coils 201, 202 and 203 arranged in a coin path detect shape, thickness and material of a coin, respectively. The detection coils 201, 202 and 203 are constructed as oscillation coils of oscillation circuits 204, 205 and 206 having independent oscillation frequencies. Numeral 207 denotes an AND circuit, and numeral 208 denotes a counter. The oscillation frequencies of the oscillation circuits 204, 205 and 206 are sequentially read by strobe signals S₁, S₂ and S₃ from a microcomputer 209 and coins are selected by examining the read data by executing a coin selection program in the microcomputer 209. See Japanese Examined Patent Publication 58 6985 . In Fig. 8, IN Fig. 9 shows a configuration of a prior art bridge balance point detection system. An oscillation coil 351 is excited by an A.C. power supply 350 of a constant voltage and supplies constant voltages to two receiving coils 352 and 353. Numeral 310A denotes a detection coil for detecting material and thickness of a coin, and numeral 310B denotes a detection coil for detecting a shape of the coin. The detection coil 310A forms bridge circuits 311A 314A one for each denomination of coin and each including the detection coil 310A in one side of the bridge. Outputs of the bridge circuits are supplied to differential amplifiers 301A 304A, respectively, and outputs thereof are supplied to comparators 305A 308A, respectively. Outputs of the comparators 305A 308A are supplied to a discrimination circuit 309. The detection coil 310B is similarly configured to the detection coil 310A and connected to the discrimination circuit 309. An output of the A.C. power supply of the bridge circuits is supplied to the discrimination circuit 309 through a waveform conversion circuit 310. The discrimination circuit 309 supplies a reference pulse train to a clock pulse input port CP and output levels from the comparators 305A 308A and 305B 308B and compares them with a predetermined reference to select the coin. See Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. 58 30632 In Fig. 9, L1A L4A and R1A R4A are variable inductors and variable resistors which form standard impedance elements for denominations of coins of the bridge circuits 311A 314A including the detection coil 310A, Y Fig. 10 shows a configuration of a prior art impedance voltage detection system. Numeral 901 denotes a detection coil arranged in a coin path to detect a material of a coin, numerals 902 and 903 denotes detection coils for detecting a thickness of the coin and numeral 904 denotes a detection coil for detecting a diameter of the coin. The coils 901 904 form a portion of an oscillation circuit OSC. Changes of impedances of the coils 901 904 are outputted as a frequency change of the oscillation circuit OSC and the frequency change is converted to a voltage by a frequency voltage conversion circuit FVC, an output of which is supplied to material, thickness and diameter discrimination circuits M, T and D. The discrimination circuits M, T and D compare the detection outputs with predetermined references for each denomination of coin to select the coin. Numerals 905, 906 and 907 denote sensors arranged near the detection coils 901, 902 and 903, respectively, for detecting passage of the coin through the detection coils. The discrimination circuits M, T and D are set and reset by the signals of the sensors 905, 906 and 907. See Japanese Examined Utility Model Publication No. 56 11182 . A₁ A₄ denote AND gates which produce outputs when coins A, B, C and D are discriminated, respectively, and A₅ denotes an AND gate which produces a false coin output when a coin does not correspond to any of the coins A, B, C and D. The AND gate A₅ produces the output when NO signals are supplied from the discrimination circuits M, T and D. DT₁ and DT₂ denote first and second differentiation circuits which output signals in response to the detection signals of the passage detection sensors 905 and 907. A flip flop FF is set and reset by those signals. In the prior art selection apparatus shown in Fig. 8, a plurality of independent oscillation circuits are provided one for each of test items of the coin size, material and thickness and they are operated at the frequencies suitable for the respective tests. As a result, the flows of signals in the detection system is complex and the circuit configuration is complex. Further, wiring cables for the detection coils must be shielded in order to prevent interference of the signals in the oscillation circuits. In the circuit of Fig. 9, two side bridge impedance elements, differential amplifier and comparator are required for one detection coil for each denomination of coin. Thus, the signal flow in the detection system is complex and a number of circuit components are required. Further, adjustment for balancing the bridge for each denomination of coin is required. In the circuit of Fig. 10, the detection coils are connected in series and the detection circuit including the oscillation circuits is simplified. However, the independent detection coils are required one for each of the test items of the coin size, material and thickness , and the coin passage sensor and the detection circuit are required for each detection coil. Accordingly, the number of circuit components increases and the circuit configuration is complex. The prior art selection apparatus are thus complex in the circuit configuration and require a large number of components. Accordingly, the cost increases, chance of occurrence of trouble is high and serviceability is low because the signals in the detection system are complex. In a coin changer or an automatic vending machine which incorporates the coin selection apparatus, a demand to reduce the size of the apparatus has been increasing. The prior art apparatus cannot satisfy such demand. GB A 1401363 describes a coin selector which has a coin path with a pair of detection coils which are connected in antiphase and which operate in conjunction with a field winding to detect coins. US A 4323148 describes a coin selector having a coin path, two sets of detection coils each having two coils opposingly arranged along the coin path and a detection circuit for detecting changes of impedances of the detection coils caused when the coin passes through the detection coils. According to the present invention there is provided a coin selection apparatus comprising The present invention will be described now by way of example only, with particular reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figs. 1, 2 and 4 show one embodiment of the present invention, and Figs. 3, 5 and 6 show representative characteristics. In Figs. 2 and 4, the like numerals to those shown in Fig. 1 designate the like elements. Fig. 1A shows a main portion of the coin selection apparatus and Fig. 1B shows a circuit configuration. In Fig. 1, a coin 7 thrown in from a port 2 of a coin selection apparatus 1 rolls down a graded ramp 3 and passes by a detection coil 8 and a detection coil 9, and if the coin 7 is determined to be a true coin by the detection coils 8 and 9, a gate 4 is opened and the coin 7 is fed to a true coin path 5. If the coin 7 is determined to be a false coin, the gate 4 is not opened and the coin 7 is returned through a false coin path 6. The first detection coil 8 and the second detection coil 9 have coils 8a and 8b, and coils 9a and 9b connected in series as shown in Fig. 1B and form a resonance circuit with capacitors C₁ and C₂. The resonance circuit and a feedback amplifier 15, base resistors R₂ and R₃, an emitter feedback resistor R₁ and a transistor Q₁ form an oscillation circuit 12. The oscillation circuit 12 normally oscillates at a constant frequency determined by a series equivalent inductance of the detection coils 8 and 9 and the capacitors C₁ and C₂, and an A.C. output determined by a ratio of a load impedance of the resonance circuit and the emitter feedback resistor R₁ is produced at a collector of a transistor Q₁. As the thrown in coin 7 approaches the detection coils 8 and 9, the load impedance of the resonance circuit changes depending on a conductivity of the coin 7, a permeability µ of the coin 7, a thickness τ of the coin 7 and relative positions between the coin 7 and the detection coils 8 and 9, and the change appears as a change in the collector voltage of the transistor Q₁. C₃ denotes a D.C. blocking coupling capacitor. The A.C. voltage output of the transistor Q₁ is supplied to a rectification circuit 13 through the coupling capacitor C₃ and a detection output is taken out as a D.C. voltage. D₁ and D₂ denote rectifying diodes, C₄ and R₄ denote filtering capacitor and resistor, and R₅ and C₅ denote resistor and capacitor of a low pass filter, which bypasses a high frequency component of a steady oscillation frequency band of the oscillation circuit 12. Thus, the detection output free from a high frequency ripple noise is supplied to an A D converter input terminal of a microcomputer 14. The pair of detection coils 8 and 9 are placed in grooves of pot type ferrite cores 402A 402D as shown in Figs. 2A and 2B with the coils 8a, 8b, 9a and 9b being embedded therein. In the present embodiment, the outer diameters of the detection coils 8 and 9 are smaller than a minimum diameter of true coins as shown in Fig. 4, and arranged in the coin paths 10 and 11 so that they are within the range of the diameter of the coin 7. Thus, the detection coils 8 and 9 are little influenced by the diameter of the true coin 7. The detection coil 8 of Fig. 1 includes the coils 8a and 8b arranged opposingly to the coin paths 10 and 11 with a spacing of d₃ therebetween, as shown in Fig. 2A. Those coils are connected in series and in phase. Accordingly, a direction of magnetic fluxes created thereby is in a direction to penetrate into the coin 7 as shown by an arrow 410. Therefore, the magnetic fluxes change depending on the type of the coin 7 and the thickness and material of the coin can be detected. The second detection coil 9 has coils 9a and 9b opposingly arranged to the coin paths 10 and 11 with the spacing d₃ therebetween as shown in Fig. 2B. Those coils are connected in series with opposite phases. Accordingly, a direction of magnetic fluxes created thereby is along the surface of the coin 7 as shown by an arrow 411. When the coin is placed in the influence of the electromagnetic field, the penetration factor of the magnetic fluxes into the coin is given by d 1 In the present embodiment, the oscillation frequency of the oscillation circuit 12 is set to 115 KHz. The surface wave depth d in copper Cu which is frequently used for the coin is given below with a frequency being a parameter. It has been known that the thickness of the coin can be determined accurately if the surface wave depth d meets a relationship of d coin thickness 0.1. On the other hand, from the standpoint of the determination of the material of the coin, the surface wave depth d is preferably larger than the thickness of the coin and the oscillation frequency is preferably as low as possible. In the present embodiment, the detection coil 8 comprises the opposing sensors and the opposing coils 8a and 8b are connected in series and in phase so that the apparent surface wave depth d is large enough relative to the thickness of the coin in determining the material of the coin. Fig. 3 shows a typical example of a waveform of a detection voltage developed at the A D converter input terminal of the microcomputer 14 of Fig. 1, when the coin 7 passes by the detection coils 8 and 9. The microcomputer 14 sequentially reads in the detection voltages from the A D converter input terminal and detects an output voltage E₀ when the coin 7 does not exist in the coin paths 10 and 11 and voltages V Figs. 5A and 5B show detection voltages developed when a circular false coin 703 having a diameter equal to a minimum diameter of the true coins to be selected and a false coin 703 having a diameter equal to a maximum diameter of the true coins and having the same material and thickness as those of the false coin 703 are passed through the coin paths 10 and 11 in which the first detection coil 8 and the second detection coil 9 are arranged as shown in Fig. 4. A point 710 corresponds to the material of the coin and a point 711 corresponds to the thickness of the coin. In the present embodiment, the points 710 and 711 have no change because the coins 702 and 703 are of the same material and thickness. A detection output for the false coin 702 when a mutual action between the second detection coil 9 and the false coin is eliminated is shown by a curve 704, and a detection output for the false coin 703 is shown by a curve 706. The point 710 shows the voltage bottom point of the curves 704 and 706. A detection output for the false coin 702 when a mutual action between the first detection coil 8 and the false coin is eliminated is shown by a curve 705, and a detection output for the false coin 703 is shown by a curve 707. The point 711 shows a voltage bottom point of the curves 705 and 707. A distance D₅ between the first detection coil 8 and the second detection coil 9 is selected such that the curve 704 does not affect to the bottom 711 of the curve 705 and the curve 705 does not affect to the bottom of the curve 704 when the true coin passes through the detection coils 8 and 9. Accordingly, a combined output of the curves 704 and 705 is represented by a curve 708, and a combined output of the curves 706 and 707 are represented by a curve 709. A test output voltage V The order of the arrangement of the first detection coil 8 and the second detection coil 9 along the flow of the coin may be reversed so long as the relative positional relationship of the detection coils 8 and 9 is held in the manner shown in Fig. 4A. Fig. 4B shows an arrangement of the detection coils when a diameter detection coil is additionally used as a third detection coil. Figs. 5C and 5D show detection voltage curves developed when the false coins 702 and 703 are passed through the coin paths 10 and 11. A detection output by the detection coil 8 and the false coin 702 when the mutual action between the second and third detection coils 9 and 800 and the false coin is eliminated is shown by a curve 801, and a detection output by the false coin 703 is shown by a curve 804. Similarly, a detection output by the detection coil 9 and the false coin 702 is shown by a curve 802, a detection output for the false coin 703 is shown by a curve 805, a detection output by the detection coil 800 and the false coin 702 is shown by a curve 803, and a detection output for the false coin 703 is shown by a curve 806. In the present embodiment, the third detection coil 800 is used to detect the size of the coin. The distance between the first detection coil 8 and the second detection coil 9 is selected such that, when the true coin passes therethrough, the curve 801 does not affect to the voltage bottom point 810 of the curve 802 and the curve 802 does not affect to the voltage bottom point 809 of the curve 801. It need not be smaller than the minimum diameter of the true coin. On the other hand, the distance D The third detection coil 800 is preferably has opposing sensors like the second detection coil 9 and the coils are connected in series and opposite phases so that the affect by the material to the detection output is reduced. Depending on the selection accurracy required by the coin selection apparatus, the third detection coil 800 may not be the opposing sensors. Figs. 6A to 6C show characteristic curves devived from detection outputs when circular false coins of white copper CuNi and lead Pb are passed through the coin paths 10 and 11, with an abscissa representing a diameter or a thickness t and an ordinate representing voltage V Fig. 7 shows a compare discrimination program in the microcomputer 14 of Fig. 1B. In steps 1 3, whether V In order to enhance the rejection ability for the false coin and the discrimination ability for true coin, the mutual relationship between the levels at the peak and bottom points of the detection output waveform shown in Fig. 3 and the time is determined in steps 4 and 5. In the step 4, an absolute value of a difference between V Even if the false coin is manufactured by the same material of the same diameter and thickness, if the coin has a center hole, relative difference between the peak and bottom points such as V Those differences between the true coin and the false coin could not be detected in the prior art apparatus. In the present embodiment, those differences are checked in combination to attain accurate discrimination of the true coin. In accordance with the present invention, two sets of detection coils each having two coils opposingly arranged in a predetermined spaced relationship along a coin path along which a coin is slid, and one set of detection circuit detect the three factors of the coin diameter, material and thickness and the appearance difference from a reference coin for example, presence or absence of a center hole . Accordingly, the coin can be accurately selected with a very simple arrangement and a small number of components. Thus, the serviciability is enhanced. The present invention can satisfy the requirement for the compactness in the coin changer and the automatic vending machine which incorporate the coin selection apparatus.
