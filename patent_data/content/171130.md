# Cartridge tape drive with improved head positioner means.

## Abstract
A miniaturized cartridge type tape drive for data storage applications has a main support frame upon which is mounted a tape drive motor and a transducer positioning motor, disposed one behind the other. Both such motors preferably have generally flat silhouettes and are directly coupled to corresponding actuat ing members a tape driving capstan for the tape drive motor, and a rotary positioning cam for the transducer positioning motor. An elongated transducer positioning linkage arm 40 extends from the rotary cam, to the transducer, and is pivotally mounted 42 in mounts on the frame. The arm is biassed into contact with the cam at one end 48 , and the transducer at the other 52 , by means of a spring 54 .
