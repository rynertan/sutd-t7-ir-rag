# Improvements in self energising disc brakes.

## Abstract
In order to provide a substantially constant input velocity ratio, a substantially constant brake factor, or a compromise between the two, the arrangement of the recesses 14 in the pressure plates 6, 7 , and in particular that of the ramp surfaces 22 , is constructed and arranged such that a given relative angular movement between the plates produces a predetermined separation of the plates in an axial direction. This can be achieved by constraining the balls 13 in both recesses of each pair for movement in a predetermined path, conveniently by means of a scissors action, or the balls 13 are constrained against relative bodily movement in the recesses in one plate 6 , with the ramp surfaces 22 of the recesses in the other plate 7 being suitably profiled.

## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN SELF ENERGISING DISC BRAKES This invention relates to self energising disc brakes of the kind in which rotatable friction discs provided with friction linings are adapted to be brought into engagement with spaced opposed braking surfaces in a housing by pressure plates located between the friction discs and centred by stationary pilot lugs, application of the brake being initiated by angular movement of the pressure plates effected by operation of a brake applying mechanism connected to radially projecting lugs on the plates, and through which a brake applying force is applied to the plates, balls or rollers being located in co operating recesses in the adjacent faces of the pressure plates such that on operation of the brake applying mechanism to move the pressure plates angularly in opposite directions, the engagement of the balls or rollers with ramps defined by edges of the recesses causes the pressure plates to move apart into engagement with the friction discs which are urged into engagement with the braking surfaces, the pressure plates being carried round with the friction discs until one is arrested by the engagement of a lug on the plate with a drag taking stop abutment in the housing and the continued angular movement of the other pressure plate provides a servo action. Self energising brakes of the kind set forth are commonly used in tractors and like vehicles. In known brakes of the kind set forth the balls or rollers are free to adopt any free position within the constraints of a pair of ramps which are substantially parallel. In addition the brake applying mechanism usually comprises links which are pivotally connected to the radially projecting lugs on the plates and through which a brake applying force, for example from a pedal, is applied to the plates which a pull rod, which is pivotally connected to the inner ends of the links, is moved in a radial direction. In such known constructions in which the links are substantially equal in length, and the distances between the pivotal connections on the lugs and the common pivotal connection with the pull rod are substantially equal, the input velocity ratio changes as wear of the friction linings progresses.Specifically the velocity ratio steadily reduces as the links follow up the relative angular movement of the pressure plates which, via the balls or rollers and ramps, is a consequence of clearances, deflections, and lining wear of the braking faces. It therefore follows that there is an undesirable reduction in mechanical advantage which progressively worsens during the life of the friction linings. Clearly it is desirable to maintain the velocity ratio substantially at a constant value throughout the wear life of the friction linings, particularly in those constructions in which travel setting, usually precise manual adjustment to compensate for wear of the friction linings, is normal practice. In other constructions it may be desirable, as a modification to this for the brake factor1 to remain substantially constant. The brake factor BF can be defined as BF Total Lining Drag Pull rod effort Then constancy can be achieved using the relationship EMI3.1 where Ol is the instantaneous effective ramp angle in synchronisation with V1 the instantaneous velocity ratio pull rod travel fangular movement of the pressure plates measured at the lining effective radius . 0 is similarly in association with V2 and ss is the nominal brake lining coefficient of friction. A substantially constant brake factor will ensure a substantially constant input effort, the optimum conditions for balanced braking, especially on steer turn tractors with independent pressure balanced hydraulically actuated brakes. A substantially constant brake factor is normally to be preferred to a substantially constant overall velocity ratio, since the latter displays improving performance characteristics as brake lining wear occurs, but it is in the new lining condition that any legal requirements are measured. In some circumstances a compromise between the constant velocity and the brake factor approach may be desirable. According to one aspect of our invention, in a self energising disc brake of the kind set forth the ramps are so constructed and arranged that for a given relative angular displacement between the pressure plates the balls or rollers are constrained to be located in a single pre determined position relative to the pressure plates, the balls or roller being located in corresponding single positions relative to the pressure plates for each corresponding relative angular displacement of the pressure plates, a given relative angular movement between the pressure plates producing a pre determined separation of the plates in an axial direction. This is achieved by avoiding parallelism between the ramps of a pair and instead arranging for the profiles of the ramps to be such that the effective ramp angles change in senses which directly complement changes in the geometry of the links of the brakeapplying mechanism. By suitably varying the ramp angles we can achieve a substantially constant velocity ratio or a substantially constant brake factor BF , or compromise between the two. When it is desired to provide a substantially constant velocity ratio, the required variations in the ramp angles are greater than those required for a constant brake factor, and the brake can become more sensitive to lining frictional changes. Balls may be constrained by a scissors action of the recesses of a complementary pair with the recesses being set in directions which cross. For a measured relative angular movement of the pressure plates, the resultant axial separation between the plates diminishes as the balls assume a reducing pitch circle diameter. In such a construction the angle of each ramp may be uniform or variable. In another construction each ball or roller can be constrained against relative movement with respect to one of the plates, with the necessary ramp angle being profiled in the complementary recess in the other plate. In such a construction the ball or roller may be constrained by a liner of low friction material housed in the recess. This improves performance in brakes of a dry type. In brakes of a liquid cooled type no such liner is normally necessary since adequate lubrication is provided by the cooling oil. According to a second aspect of our invention an actuator assembly for a disc brake of the selfenergising type comprises first and second pressure plates which are superimposed upon each other, balls or rollers located in co operating inclined angularly spaced recesses in adjacent faces of the pressure plates, and tension return springs acting between the pressure plates to urge them towards each other with the balls or rollers urged towards the lower ends of ramps defined by the edges of the recesses, the ramps being so constructed and arranged that for a given relative angular displacement between the pressure plates the balls or rollers are constrained to be located in a single pre determined position relative to the pressure plates, the balls or rollers being located in corresponding single positions relative to the pressure plates for each corresponding relative angular determined separation of the plates in an axial direction. A known disc brake of the kind set forth and some brakes in accordance with the present invention are illustrated in the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 is an end elevation of a known brake provided with new friction linings and with the brake in an off position Figure 2 is a view similar to Figure 1 but with the brake applied Figure 3 is a section through a pair of complementary recesses in the pressure plates in the position they assume in Figure 2 Figure 4 is a view similar to Figure 1 but with the friction lining fully worn Figure 5 is a view similar to Figure 4 but with the brake applied Figure 6 is a section through a pair of complementary recesses in the pressure plates in the position they assume in Figure 5 Figure 7 is an elevation of portions of pairs of pressure plates in accordance with our invention with new friction linings Figure 8 is a section on the line 8 8 of Figure 7 Figure 8 is a section on the line 8 8 of Figure 7 Figure 9 is an elevation similar to Figure 7 but with the lining worn Figure 10 is a section on the line 10 10 of Figure 9 Figure 11 is a section through a pair of pressure plates showing a modification Figure 12 is a section similar to Figure 11 but including a further modification and Figure 13 is a section similar to Figure 11 but showing another construction. In the known construction illustrated in Figures 1 to 6 of the drawings a self energising brake comprises a housing I through which a rotatable shaft 2 extends axially. A pair of axially spaced friction discs 3, 4 provided on opposite sides with linings of friction material are slidably splined on the shaft 2. The discs 3, 4 are adapted to be brought into engagement with axially spaced radial braking surfaces at opposite ends of the housing 1 by a pair of annular pressure plates 6 and 7 which are located between the discs and are centred by three stationary pilot lugs 10, 11, 12 on the housing 1. Balls or rollers 13 are located in angularly spaced co operating oppositely inclined recesses 14 in adjacent faces of the pressure plates 6 and 7. Angularly spaced tension return springs not shown act to urge the pressure plates together. The application of the brake is initiated by moving the pressure plates 6 and 7 angularly in opposite directions which causes the balls 13 to tend to ride up ramps formed by parallel walls of recesses 14, and the pressure plates 6 and 7 then move apart into with the friction discs 3, 4 to urge them into engagement engagement with the radial surfaces 8 on the housing 1. When the discs 3, 4 are rotating in one direction, the plates 6 and 7 are carried round with the discs 3, 4 until one plate is arrested by the engagement of a radial lug 15, 16 on that plate with a drag taking stop abutment in the form of an anchor pin defined by the lug 12. Continued angular movement of the other plate provides a servo action to increase the braking torque. When the shaft 2 is rotating in the opposite direction and the brake is applied, the sequence described above is repeated except that the angular movement of the other plate is arrested. The angular movement of the plates 6 and 7 to apply the brake is initiated by a brake applying mechanism 20. The mechanism 20 comprises a pair of toggle links 21 and 22 which are symmetrically arranged and are of equal lengths. The link 21 is pivotally connected at its innermost end to a radial lug 15 on the pressure plate 6 by a connection 23, and the link 22 is pivotally connected at its innermost end to a radial lug 16 on the pressure plate 7 by a pivotal connection 24. The free ends of both links 20 and 21 are pivotally connected between the limbs of a bifurcated fitting 25 by means of a pivot pin 25 and the fitting is coupled to the inner end of a radially movable pull rod 27. In the application of the brake, a pull applied to the pull rod 27 in a radial direction is transmitted to both toggle links 21 and 22 to urge the lugs 15 and 16 towards each other in a circumferential direction to effect application of the brake with selfenergising action as described above. When the shaft 2 is rotating in the anti clockwise direction shown by the arrow A in Figure 2 of the drawings, the pressure plates 6 and 7 are carried round with the discs 3 and 4 until the plate 6 is arrested by the engagement of the lug 15 with the stop abutment 12. When the friction linings are new as shown inFigures 1 to 3, the links 21 and 22 are substantially in the positions shown in full lines in Figure 2 with the pull rod 27 having been displaced circumferentially through a relatively small distance and with the balls or rollers 13 having ridden away correspondingly small distances up the ramp surfaces 14 when the brake is applied. When the friction linings are worn, in an off position of brake shown in Figure 4 the balls or rollers 13 are held up the ramp surfaces 14 and both lugs 15 and 16 are displaced by substantial distances from the anchor pin 12. When the brake is applied, as shown in Figure 5, the pull rod 22 is displaced circumferentially through a similar distance to that between Figures 1 and 2, but the distance through which it is moved to effect application of the brake is relatively less than the distance through which it is moved to apply the brake when the linings are new. conditions illustrated in Figures 1 to 3, and inFigures 4 to 6. In the construction in accordance with the invention and illustrated in Figures 7 to 10, the overlapping recesses 14 of each pair are arranged to diverge inwardly in a generally radially inwards direction from a deeper outer end portion 30 of partspherical outline to a shallower and narrower inner end portion 31. The ramp surfaces 32 which interconnect the outer and inner end portions 30 and 31 may be of uniform or variable angle. Each ball 13 is constrained between the recesses 14 of the respective pair by a scissors action of the two recesses. As shown in Figures 7 and 8, with the linings new, the balls 13 are constrained between the deeper outer end portions 30 of corresponding pairs of recesses 14.When the brake is applied the balls 13 ride up the ramp surfaces 32 as shown in Figure 8, with the balls 13 assuming a reducing pitch circle. As shown in Figures 9 and 10, with the linings worn, the balls 13 are constrained by the recesses between the ends of the ramp surfaces 32 which are adjacent to the shallower inner end portions 31 of the recesses. It will thus be seen that for a measured relative angular movement of the pressure plates 6 and 7, the resultant axial separation of the plates diminishes relatively as the balls 13 assume the reducing pitch circle diameter. In the modified construction of Figure 11, each ball 13 is constrained directly by the corresponding recesses 14 in the plate 6 which is of substantially hemi spherical outline, and the ramp surfaces of the recesses 14 in the plate 7 are of variable angle to provide the desired velocity ratio or brakefactor BF . As shown in Figure 12, each ball 13 is constrained by a liner 33 of low friction material which is received in the respective recess 14 in the plate 6. The liner 33 improves the performance of brakes of the dry type. The modified construction illustrated in Figure 13 is similar to Figure 11 except that the ramp surfaces 32 have uniform angles and the inner end portions 31 are omitted. This facilitates construction since machining of the recesses in the plate 7 is simplified.
