# Apparatus and methods for controlling induction motors.

## Abstract
When induction motors are lightly loaded, their power fac tors and efficiency are poor but in the arrangement power fac tor is controlled regardless of load. An induction motor 10 is connected by way of a triac 12 to a supply 11 . The voltage opening across the triac 12 is monitored by a comparator 21 for vol tage steps which correspond to current turn off and a signal is developed at the output of an amplifier 19 , which represents error from required phase lag. A comparator 17 and trigger pulse generator 16 trigger the triac 12 in accordance with the error. An override circuit 31 overrides the control system during starting. A number of further induction motors 28, 29 may be connected in parallel with the motor 10 . Additional circuits deal with problems arising when a three phase induc ction motor is connected by three wires only.
