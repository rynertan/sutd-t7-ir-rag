# PROCEDURE FOR SHEARING ROLLED PRODUCTS AT HIGH SPEED, AND A SHEARS WITH DEVIATOR WHICH CARRIES OUT SUCH PROCEDURE

## Abstract
This invention concerns a procedure for shearing rolled products, and in particular rolled bars 14 , which is suitable for shearing rolled products 14 sliding at high and very high speeds and in which the rolled product 14 in motion is de viated sideways locally and brought into contact at an angle with stationary blade means 15 , the rolled product 14 thus being sheared. The invention also concerns a high speed shears with de viator 10 , which is suitable for carrying out the above proce dure and comprises a channel 11 for delivering rolled pro ducts 14 , a channel 12 to forward the same 14 to a usage means and a channel 13 for scrap and includes stationary blade means 15 and means 16 18 to deviate the rolled pro duct 14 upstream from such blade means 15 .
