# Process and device for the continuous production of glass fibre or strand reinforced sheets of thermoplastic polymers.

## Abstract
A device suitable for preparing thermoplastic polymer sheets reinforced with fibres or strands, comprising, in the following order A one or more glass fibre or strand feeders B a conveyor belt 13 underlying such feeders C a heating element 19 for heating the glass fibres or strands 3 D proportioning device 20 above such belt, for proportion ing the powdered polymer E a fibre compression roller 21 on such belt F proportioning device 22 above such belt, for proportion ing the powdered polymer G a heating element 23 for the glass strands or fibres 3 H proportioning device 24 above the belt, for proportioning the powdered polymer I a compression element 30 for compressing the aggre gate of fibres and polymer at a temperature higher by at least 50 C than the polymer melting temperature.
