# Pickup device for picking up vibration transmitted through bones.

## Abstract
A pickup device for picking up sound generated by the vocal chords and transmitted through bones from the nasal bone. A microphone 11 is mounted on or embedded into an eyeglass like assembly 13, 15 . When the microphone is mounted as a nosepiece, it is made into direct contact with the nose so that it directly picks up vibration transmitted through the nasal bone. When the microphone is mounted on the eyeglass like frame or embedded therein, it picks up vibration transmitted through the nosepieces and eyeglass like frame. A cord 12 whose end is electrically connected to the microphone is held by holding member extended from the eyeglass like assembly 13, 15 so that the transmission of mechanical vibration to the microphone is prevented.
