# Optical fiber position sensor.

## Abstract
An optical fiber position sensor includes an optical fiber cable 40 wound in the shape of a single layer, tightly wound coil, the coil being secured to a first member 43 . A second member 21 , which is linearly movable with respect to the first member, has fixed thereto an LED 20 which is aimed at the coil such that radiation being emitted from the LED is in jected approximately tangentially into the coil. Radiation being transmitted through the coil is attenuated as a function of the distance that it travels therethrough and as a result, radiation exiting the coil through the terminations is representative of the location of the movable member 21 with respect to the fixed member 43 .
