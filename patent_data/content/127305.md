# Human growth hormone, and process for its production, expression vehicles for producing pre HGH and host cells transformed thereby.

## Abstract
The production of mature hGH In E. coli and Pseudomonas strains transformed by a plasmid which encodes pre hGH comprising the signal polypeptide and the hormone itself is described. These prokaryotes process the pre hGH to cleave the signal sequence and, thereby, produce mature hGH.
