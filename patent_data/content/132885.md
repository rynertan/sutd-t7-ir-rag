# Multiplying circuit comprising switched capacitor circuits.

## Abstract
Multiplying circuit for multiplying a first signal x t by a periodic second signal y t and being particularly suitable for use as an amplitude demodulator in a stereo decoder or in a phase locked loop. It comprises N signal channels 26 . , each receiving the first signal x t and each producing a channel signal. Each signal channel is formed by, arranged in cascade, a switched capacitor circuit 28 , 1, 28 . 2 , 29 . , the circuit included in the signal channel having number k being control led by a train of control pulses g k,i which each have a finite duration and occur with a repetition period T₀ and at instants t₀ k T₀ N iT₀ where i .... 2, 1,0,1,2,3, ..., means 29 . , 31, 30 for multiplying the amplitude of the signal x t by a con stant weighting factor W k which is equal to y t₀k T₀ N , pulsereshaping means 29 . , 30, 31 for converting a pulse applied thereto into a pulse having a predetermine duration. The channel signals thus obtained are added together in an adder device 30, 31 to form a sum signal. This sum signal is sampled in a sampling arrangement 34 1 , 34 2 , 35 at instants comprised within the interval between the end of a control pulse g k,i and the beginning of the subsequent control pulse g k 1,i .
