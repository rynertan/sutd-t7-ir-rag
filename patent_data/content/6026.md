# Charge plate and method of manufacture.

## Abstract
A charge plate for an ink jet printer comprises a rigid support plate 26 provided with a medially extending elongated slot 27 and an electrode support structure 28 cast in place adheringly against the walls of the slot 27 . The electrode support structure 28 is fabricated from a non conductive casting resin which is cast against a silicone elastomer mold 23 having a series of upstanding pegs 24 coated with a release agent and an overcoating of conductive epoxy 25 . The casting resin flows around the peg structure 24 and bonds itself to the conductive epoxy coating 25 . The conductive epoxy material 25 transfers from the mold surface 23, 24 to the electrode support structure 28 upon mold separation, so that the casting process produces a series of cylindrical charging electrodes 29 cast in place within charging tunnels 21 in the electrode support structure 28 . The resulting product is subjected to a finishing operation, and flexible printed circuits leads are thereafter attached to the charging electrodes 29 .
