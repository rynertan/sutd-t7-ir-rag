# DEVICE FOR MAUFACTURE OF HEMMED PIECES OF CLOTH CUT FROM A WEB

## Abstract
A device for manufacture of pieces of cloth 12a cut from a web 12 e.g. a mesh tissue web or the like in the direction of the threads, and having the cut edges trimmed e.g. hemmed, and of the type where the web prior to the cutting is straightened in pile free positions 13 by means of a straightening device 14 . The object of the present inven tion is to provide a device with which a straightening, cutting and then a trimming of the cut edges are effected on a simple way, without the piece of cloth thereby having any possibility of becoming deformed. Another object of the invention is to provide a compact device which does not demand larger place than the known straightening devices. Furthermore according to the invention it shall also be possible to treat webs which are equipped with longitudinal side seams with the device. These tasks have been solved by the fact that the straightening device consists of two rulers extending later ally across the web and being adjustable relative to each other, thus that the web or only pile free portions thereof can pass freely between them, that in front of the straightening device as seen in the web direction is arranged a transfer device adapted to pass through a first conveyor device and equipped with seizing means for conveying the forward edge of the web for advancing and metering a piece of cloth and for transfer of its forward edge to a second conveyor device, and that the first and second conveyor devices are provided with means for arresting the cut edges of each piece of cloth and for transport of the piece of cloth in arrested position to a device for trimming the cut edges.
