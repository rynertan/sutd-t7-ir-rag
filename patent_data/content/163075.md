# High density silicon nitride bodies.

## Abstract
A pressureless sintering process is disclosed for produc ing silicon nitride bodies of near theoretical density from an admixture of silicon nitride and sintering aids of mixtures of lanthanum oxide and aluminum oxide, lanthanum alumin ate, and mixtures of lanthanum aluminate and aluminum oxide and mixtures of lanthanum aluminate and lanthanum oxide.
