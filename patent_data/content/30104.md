# Process for preparing organic dispersion of acid type fluorinated polymer.

## Abstract
An organic dispersion is prepared of an acid type fluorinated polymer comprises copolymerizing a fluorinated ethylenically unsaturated monomer and a functional monomer having an acid type functional group in an aqueous medium under an action of a polymerization initiator source to obtain an aqueous dispersion of an acid type fluorinated polymer having the functional monomer unit content of 5 to 40 mol and replacing an aqueous medium of the aqueous dispersion to a hydrophilic organic medium under maintaining the dispersion.
