# A gate circuit for a thyristor and a thyristor having such a gate circuit.

## Abstract
A gate circuit for a thyristor 1 is provided which supplies gate on current to the gate of the thyristor 1 when anode ca thode voltage of the thyristor 1 exceeds a predetermined lev el Vref and turns off the gate on current when the anode ca thode voltage falls below the predetermined level Vref , so that conduction time of the gate on current is made as small as necessary. Such a gate circuit for a thyristor 1 comprises a comparator 2 having one input connected to the thyristor anode A and another to a predetermined voltage level source the output of the comparator 2 being connected to an AND circuit 3 another input of which is provided by a gate ignition signal generator circuit 5 and the output of which supplies the thyristor gate signal via a pulse amplifier circuit 4 .
