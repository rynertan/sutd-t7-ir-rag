# Nonrandom copolymers of ethylene and an alpha, beta unsaturated carboxylic acid, a process for their preparation and ionomers prepared from those nonrandom copolymers.

## Abstract
Compositionally uniform but nonrandom copolymers of ethylene and α,β ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms are provided having an acid content of from about 6 to about 35 weight percent, a melt index of from about 0.1 to about 800, and a ratio of weight percent adjacent acid to weight percent total acid in the copolymer of from about 0.44 to about 1.0. These copolym ers have improved physical properties such as hardness, stiffness, heat resistance and creep resistance. Further provided, is a process for preparing these copolymers in a constant environment stirred autoclave in a continuous manner wherein the reaction zone is maintained in a steady state at a pressure of from 0 to about 500 psi above, and at a temperature of from 0 to about 15 C above that needed to maintain a single phase reaction mixture at a given concen tration of copolymer and at the given acid comonomer content of the copolymer.
