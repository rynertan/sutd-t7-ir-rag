# Rotating electric motor.

## Abstract
A rotating electric motor has a permanent magnet member 23 of a circular form and an armature core 24 made of a magnetic material. The permanent magnet member 23 has a plurality of N and S poles positioned alternately around the rotary axis of the motor, and the number of the poles is P which is an even number. The armature core 24 has a plurality of teeth 26 formed between two adjacent winding slots of the armature core, and the number of the teeth is T which is an integer not less than 2P. Overlapping winding coils A,B,C of polyphase winding groups are wound in the winding slots of the armature core 24 , and the number of the phases of the polyphase winding groups is H which is an integer not less than 2. The armature core 24 has at least a pair of a short block m,a and a long block a,m each of which is a group of the teeth 26 having at least two teeth positioned sequentially. The short block has at least one short tooth n o , at least one standard tooth m n and no long tooth, and the long block a,m has at least one long tooth b c , at least one standard tooth a b and no short tooth, where the effective pitch of the standard teeth is equal to D 360 T degree, the effective pitches of the short teeth are smaller than D and the effective pitches of the long teeth are larger than D. Because of the above arrangement, the phases of the winding slots of the armature core with the period of the 1 pole pitch of the permanent magnet member are different each other, and the cogging torque of the rotating electric motor is small.
