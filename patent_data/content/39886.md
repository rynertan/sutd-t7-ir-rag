# Semiconductor laser device and method of manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A buried heterostructure semiconductor laser including a mesa shaped optical confinement region having an active layer 3 and a clad layer 4 and disposed on a semiconductor substrate 1 a burying layer 6, 7 burying both side surfaces of the region and at least one p n junction 12 so formed inside the burying layer 6,7 in parallel to the active layer 3 as to be brought under the reversely biased state during the operation of the laser wherein surface protection semicon ductor layers 5, 8 are formed on the mesa shaped optical confinement region and on the burying layer 6, 7 , respec tively, for protecting the semiconductor assembly in the arrangement such that these surface protection semiconduc tor layers 5, 8 do not come into direct contact with each other. Even if the forbidden band gaps of these surface protec tion semiconductor layers 5, 8 are relatively small, it is poss ible to realize a semiconductor laser having an extremely small leakage current and reduced variance of threshold cur rent values, while protecting the surface of the multi layer semiconductor layers.
