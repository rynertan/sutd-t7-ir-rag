# DATA PROCESSING APPARATUS ADAPTED FOR MEMORY READBACK CHECKING

## Abstract
To provide for a more economic buffer capacity through facilitating high speed readback check of data transferred to a cyclic memory 16 from a free input buffer before the source data is lost, the cyclic memory is orga nized into a number of data blocks, each interleaved with or simultaneously accessible with the other data blocks. Thus, a long data record comprises several data blocks and therefore several cycles of the memory. A readback check of data transferred is accomplished by writing data into one check number generator 51 and one data block in a first cycle, writing data into another block on the second cycle while reading back the first data block to a second check number generator 52 , continuing in this manner until the entire record is transferred, and reading the last block of written data into the check number generator 52 . The two generated check numbers are then compared to detect any error and effect a retransfer if required before the source of the record is lost by overwriting.
