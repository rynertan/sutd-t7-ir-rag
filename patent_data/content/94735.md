# Fuel feed and charge forming apparatus.

## Abstract
The disclosure embraces a fuel feed and charge forming apparatus wherein the apparatus is of comparatively small size particularly for use with chain saws and other motor driven tools to effect the reduction in weight. The charge forming apparatus embodies a body 36 construction pro viding external support members 78 to resist creep and bolt torque deformation, as well as providing a heat sink heat transfer means. A valve seat construction 137 for shape retention is also provided to inhibit fuel metering distortions caused by deformation of valve seats by carbure tor body creep.
