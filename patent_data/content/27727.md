# Polyamides suitable for use as hot melt adhesives, process for their production, and adhesive compositions comprising them.

## Abstract
A polyamide suitable as a hot melt adhesive contains pendent graft copolymerised chains derived from aromatic compounds having an olefinically unsaturated moiety, e.g. styrene, or from lower methacrylates, epoxy containing unsaturated compounds, acrylonitrile or methacrylonitrile, but contains no free graft comonomer. The polyamides show improved peel strengths, espe cially at low and high temperatures. The low temperature properties may be further improved by incorporating an elas tomer, preferably a thermoplastic elastomer, part of which is compatible with the graft copolymerised chains.
