# Data recording reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A date recording reproducing apparatus which uses a recording medium having a data recording area divided into a plurality of sectors, each sector having an address section in which a first address signal is recorded and a data recording section, wherein a second address signal is added to data to be recorded, the second address signal representing an address of a sector in which the data is to be recorded, the data combined with the second address signal is encoded for error compensation and is recorded in the recording mode, and the second address signal reproduced with the data from the data recording section in the reproduction mode is used to dis criminate an address of a target sector for reproduction. The sector address is obtained to the same level of precision as that of the reproduced data, thereby performing precise sec tor control and preventing data loss.
