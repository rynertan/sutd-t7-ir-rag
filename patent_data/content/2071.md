# Synthetic resin pipe joint.

## Abstract
A synthetic resin pipe joint having front and rear inclined walls 6, 7 defining a packing holding annular groove 5 is provided with softness and elasticity sufficient to cause flattening deformation on impingement with a pipe 2 contained therein, and expansion of a gap d between this pipe and the inner circumferential face of the pipe joint is effectively prevented. On overall flattening deformation of the pipe joint, the front and rear inclined walls are similarly deformed and a packing 4 contained therein is deformed stably with the deformation of the inclined walls without causing distortions in the packing. Because of such high elasticity and flexibility as not possessed by rigid joints, a pipe line can be effectively constructed by using this pipe joint.
