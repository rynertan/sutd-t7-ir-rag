# Recovery of cell receptors.

## Abstract
A method is provided for recovering cell surface receptors for a specific ligand. In the method cells are incubated in the presence of a ligand for a period of time sufficient to permit the ligand to bind to the receptor on the cell membrane surface and to form a complex of the ligand and the receptor. The incubation is continued for a time sufficient to permit the complex to become internalized in the cell in the form of coated vesicles. The membrane of the cells is then disrupted prior to the time that the complex is released from the coated vesicle within the cell to provide a dispersion of cell fragments and coated vesicles. The dispersion is then contacted with a monoclonal antibody which is specific for the protein coating of the coated vesicle so as to recover the coated vesicle containing the cell surface receptor for the specific ligand.

## Description
RECOVERY OF CELL RECEPTORSField of the Invention Generally, the present invention is directed to a method for recovering cell surface receptors for a specific ligand. More particularly, the present invention is directed to the recovery of a specific cell surface receptor for use as an immunogen for producing monoclonal antibodies and for testing the efficacy of drug delivery via cell surface receptors.Background of the Invention It is known that various ligands, including hormones, such as insulin nutritional substances, such as low density lipoproteins LDL viruses, such as adenovirus toxins, such as diptheria toxin and ricin and immunoglobulin, including polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies, bind to specific receptors on the surfaces of cells. Such cell surface receptors are often markers for specific types of cells or functional lymphocyte subsets. For example, the asialoglycoprotein receptor is found only on parenchymal cells of the liver and transferrin receptor is a marker for activated lymphocytes see, for example, Wall D. A. et al 1981 Galactosespecific Recognition System of Mammalian Liver Receptor Distribution on the Hepatocyte Cell Surface J.Cell Biol 90 687 696 and Trowbridge, I.S. et al 1981 Human cell surface glycoprotein related to cell proliferation is the receptor for transferrin Proc. Nat l Acad. of Science U.S.A. 78 3039 3043. Monoclonal antibodies reacting with such receptors provide both tissue specific probes and a tool for analyzing the level of lymphocyte subpopulations. Tissue specific monoclonal antibodies can be used to identify the tissue origin of a metastatic cell and to target drugs to a specific tissue. Monoclonal antibodies which can detect lymphocyte subsets are useful in diagnosis of immunological states and also for targeting drugs to malignant cell subpopulations. Heretofore, monoclonal antibodies have been prepared which are specific to certain cell surface receptors. The current technology for preparing such monoclonal antibodies involves immunizing mice with whole cells. Of course, the whole cell contains receptors other than the receptors of interest.This complicates the screening process to recover a monoclonal antibody which is specific for the cell surface receptor of interest. The cell surface receptor of interest is a minor component of the total cell surface protein immunogen. It would be desirable to provide a purified or partially purified receptor for use in immunizing mice to simplify the procedure for producing monoclonal antibodies specific for the desired cell surface receptor. It has recently been discovered that some cell surface receptors actually enter the cells in combination with the ligand which recognizes the receptor Scientific American, How Receptors Bring Proteins and Particles Into Cells, A. Dautry Varsat et.al., Vol. 250, No. 5, pp. 52 58, May, 1984. For example, it has been learned that insulin receptors and insulin enter cells together. The method whereby receptors are internalized within the cells has also recently been discovered. Some receptors are localized to places on the cell surface called coated pits where they bind to a ligand, such as LDL. Other receptors bind ligands, such as insulin, then move to coated pits. The receptor and its ligand are then internalized by the cell in a membrane sack called a coated vesicle. The coated vesicles fuse and accumulate in sacks inside the cells, known as endosomes or receptosomes . The coated vesicles have a coating of protein which dissociates as they form the endosomes.The endosome evolves into a form referred to as a CURL compart for uncoupling receptor and ligand which contains an acid bath where the ligand is released from the receptor. The ligand, in many cases, goes to the lysosome where it is digested.The receptor, in many cases, goes back to the cell surface. As indicated, when the appropriate ligand hormone, antibody or nutrient binds to its cell surface receptor, those receptors aggregate in the membrane and are internalized along with the ligand.This process is called receptor mediated endocytosis RME . Internalization results in the formation of a coated vesicle inside the cell which contains receptor ligand complexes at a much higher concentration than their occurence on the cell surface. The coated vesicles are surrounded by a protein which is probably involved in the mechanism of receptor ligand internalization.As a result of work by Barbara M F Pearse of the Medical ResearchCouncil Laboratory of Molecular Biology in England, this protein when obtained from the pig is known as clathrin Pearse, B M F. 1975 Coated vesicles from pig brain purification and biochemical characterization J.

Summary of the Invention The present invention provides a method for recovering cell surface receptors for a specific ligand. In the method cells are incubated in the presence of a ligand for a period of time sufficient to permit the ligand to bind to the receptor on the cell membrane surface and to form a complex of the ligand and the receptor. The incubation is continued for a time sufficient to permit the complex to become internalized in the cell in the form of coated vesicles.The membrane of the cells is then disrupted prior o the time that the complex is released from the coated vesicle within the cell to provide a dispersion of cell fragments and coated vesiclesThe dispersion is then contacted with a monoclonal antibody which is specific for the protein coating of the coated vesicle so as to recover the coated vesicle containing the cell surface receptor for the specific ligand.The Drawings Figure 1 is a schematic diagram showing various steps in the method of the present invention for recovering cell surface receptors.Detailed Description of the Invention In the method of the invention, a viable culture of the cells of interest is provided. As used herein the term cell culture includes a viable culture of cells and a fresh tissue sample containing viable cells. The cell culture may be provided by any suitable methods, such as those described in Fresh neyR.I. 1983 Culture of Animal Cells A Manual of Basic Technique Alan R. Liss, New York. The ligand of interest is then added to the cell culture. The ligand is preferably dispersed in a suitable medium, such as phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4. The addition of ligand, at a concentration of from about 0.1 to about 1 mg ml, is preferably such that from about 0.001 to about 0.01 mg of ligand are added per milligram of cell. The cells and ligand are then incubated for a period of from about 40 to about 60 minutes from about 2 C to about 6 C, preferably at about 4 C followed by incubation for about 3 to 5 minutes from about 32 C to about 42 C, preferably at 37 C.Incubation at these times and temperatures is sufficient to permit the ligand to react and bind with receptor sites to form a complex on the surface of the cell membrane and to permit the complex to become internalized within the cell in the form of a coated vesicle. The incubation conditions are selected, however, to prevent the coated vesicle from being ruptured within the cell, thereby releasing the ligand and receptor. The incubation at the lower temperature is sufficient to effect binding of the ligand to the receptor to form a complex but inhibits internalization of the complex into the cell. The incubation at the higher temperature for the indicated times is sufficient to permit internalization of the complex to form coated vesicles but is insufficient to permit the coated vesicles to evolve into endosomes. The cell membrane is then disrupted by any suitable method to provide a dispersion of cell fragments and coated vesicles. One suitable method for disrupting the cell membrane and releasing the coated vesicle is as follows The cells in a solution of 70mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.15M Nazi, 1mM EGTA, 0.5mM MgC12, 0.02 NaN3, 0.2mM PMSF are forced through a Stansted Cell Disruptor at an air pressure of about 2 bar and exposed to a back pressure of 12.5 psi. Unbroken cells and nuclei are then removed by centrifugation. In the case of using tissue as a source of cells. The tissue would be perfused with ligand at the same concentrations, time and temperature conditions stated above. Perfusion techniques are described in Wall D.A. et al. 1981 Galactose specificRecognition System of Mammalian Liver ReceptorDistribution on the Hepatocyte Cell Surface J. CellBiol 90 687 696. The incubated tissue would be disrupted in a high speed, shear type blender, such as a Waring blender. The coated vesicles are then recovered from the dispersion of cell fragments and coated vesicles by contacting the dispersion with a monoclonal antibody which is specific for the protein which coats the coated vesicle. There is no difficulty in developing monoclonal antibodies for such proteins, by adoption of available techiques for the preparation of monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, in the case where this protein is clathrin, a suitable clathrin specific monoclonal antibody has been developed in mice by the Stançord University School of Medicine and is available from the AmericanType Culture Collection ATCCTIB 137 CVC.4 mouse mouse hybridoma . For ease of separation, the monoclonal antibody is preferably coupled to a substrate, such as a column of agarose, such as Sepharose 2B. The dispersion of cell fragments and endosomes is then flowed through the column where the protein of the coated vesicles reacts and binds to the monoclonal antibody, while the cell fragments pass through the column. Suitable means for attachment or coupling of antibodies to substrates are well known and will not be further described herein. One suitable method is described in March, S.C., Parikh, I., Cuatrecasas, P A simplified method for cyanogen bromide activation of agarose for affinity chromatography. Anal.Biochem 60 149 152 1974 . The coated vesicles are then removed from the column with a suitable reagent. The removal conditions are preferably selected so as to sirrjltaneously disrupt the coated vesicle to provide a dispersion of ligand and receptor and leave the clathrin bound to the column. A suitable reagent is an aqueous solution with a pH of 8.0 containing about 1 of an octyl glucoside detergent, such as 50mM Tris HC1. All percentages used herein are by weight unless specifically noted otherwise. The dispersion of ligand and receptor is highly concentrated in receptor as compared to the original cell and is useful as an immunogen for production of monoclonal antibodies specific for the receptor. The receptor may also be further purified from this dispersion for use as immunogen. This involves empirical determination of further purification methods, which would vary for each individual receptor. United States Patent No. 4,364,936 to Kung et al. Column 5, line 43 to Column 6, line 39, describes a method for immunizing mice with an immunogen and producing monoclonal antibodies after such immunization. The method of the present invention may also be used to analyze the efficacy Or internalization of certain ligands, such as drugs or toxins or antibodies coupled to drugs or toxins into cells.Antibody drug or antibody toxin conjucates can be prepared as described by Thorpe eft awl 1982 , The preparation an cytotoxic pro perties of antibody toxin conjugates, Imunol. Rev. 62 199 118. Using the method of the invention, the drug, toxin or antibody conjugate is incated with the cells. The cells are disrupted and the coated vesicles are recovered. The orated vesicle can then be analyzed for the presence of t drug, toxin1 or antibody.

Cells are left on ice, 1 hr., then removed by centrifugation.3. Cells are resuspended in 50 mls. of Buffer A 1OmM HEPES pH 7.2, 0.15 M NaCL, 1mM EGTA, 0.5mMMgCl2, 0.02 NaN3, 0.2mM PMSF which has been warmed previously to 37 C. 4. After 3 minutes, during which cells are filtered through gauze into a tube in a 37 C water bath, the cell suspension is passed through a Stansted Cell Disr pter at 2 bar air pressure with a back pressure of 1 .5 ci, at rootr temperature.5. Broken cells are collected and centrifuged 12,500 rpm in an SS 34 rotor, 4 C, for 30 minutes. 6. The supernatant is removed and spun at 100,000 xg, 4 C, to pellet coated vesicles and other membrane f rarents. 7. The pellet is resuspended in 5 mls. of 20 mM MES, pE 6.2, 2mM CaCl2 Buffer B and applied to a 1 ml column of anticlathrin monoclonal antibody coupled to Cepearcse 2S, equilibrated in the same buffer.8. After washing the column with 50 volumes ofBuffer B, the column is eluted with Buffer C 50 mM Trips, pH 8.0, 1mM, SDTA . Membrane vesicles are eluted off and their clathrin coat remains on the column.9. The eluate is diluted 1 1 with 2 octylglucoside in Buffer C, to disrupt the membrane vesicles. 10. After 30 min., 4OC, the eluate is dialyzed against phosphate buffer saline, pH 7.4. This causes the receptors dissolved from the coated vesicles to form micelles.11. Mice are immunized with the dialyzed column eluate and monoclonal antibodies to components in the eluate, including insulin receptor, are produced. Example 2 Deterination of whether ricin cou led to anti transferrin receptor monoclonal antibody enters coated vesicles. Picin coupled monocional antibody is prepared as described in Thorpe, P.E. and Ross,W.C.J. 1982 , The preparation and cytotoxic properties of antibody toxin conjugates, Immunol.

Cells are treated as in Steps 2 9 above.3. Goat ânti mouse Ig is immobilized on a polyvinyl chloride microliter plate and protein binding sites are blocked with bovine serum albumin.4. Eluate from the anti clathrin monoclonal antibody column is applied to the coated plate and after 1 hour at 4 C, unbound material is washed away. 5. The presence of mouse monoclonal antibody bound to the plate is detected with 1 25I anti mouse Ig or enzyme coupled anti mouse Ig. A positive signal dc monstrates that the ricin coupled antibody had entered coated vesicles in the cell and would be eventually targeted to an acidic compartment in the cell. The accompanying drawing illustrates the procedure of Example 1. B cells are contacted with insulin and then incubated for mobilization of the coating protein and formation of vesicles. Cell disruption yields the vesicles which are temporarily retained on a column of supported monoclonal antibody. Elution under conditions favouring disruption of the vesicles leads to a dispersion containing insulin and insulin receptors, which is then used to generate monoclonal antibodies to the insulin receptor.
