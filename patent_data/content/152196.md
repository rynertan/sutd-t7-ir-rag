# Electric fencer utilizing a sealed plastic housing.

## Abstract
The electric fencer 1 comprises a completely sealed housing 12 which includes two plastic components 14, 16 having an interfitting groove 46 and rib 54 , as well as integral pins 48 on one component 16 which are pressed into recesses 50 in the other component 16. The two components 14, 16 are sonically welded together to form the completely sealed housing 12 . Additionally, a grommet 62 resists the entrance of moisture along the power cord 56 , as well as firmly gripping the power cord 56 . The grommet 62 is composed of a U shaped groove 68c on one component 14 and a tongue 70 on the other component 16 , the tongue 70 pressing against the power cord s insulation 60 so that some of the insulation 60 is forced into the U shaped groove 68c . The top 20a of the housing 12 overhangs the front panel 18 so as to shield the light coming from a small neon light 28 so that the light can be more readily seen in direct sunlight, the side walls 20c, 20d inclining forwardly so that their upper portions 21c, 21d assist in the shielding action.
