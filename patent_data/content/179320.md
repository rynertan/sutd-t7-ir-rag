# Super radiant light source.

## Abstract
A super radiant light source having an output with a low temporal coherence well suited, for example, to optical in ertial sensor applications, includes a single mode optical waveguide such as an optical fiber having its core doped with an active laser material, such as neodymium. Pump light is coupled into the optical fiber at an intensity sufficient to produce a significant amplification of the spontaneous emis sion. The reflectivity at the exit end of the fiber is low enough so that even with a high gain for the light in one traverse through the fiber, the fiber is operated well below threshold for laser oscillation. The resulting emission is of high inten sity, but has a low temporal coherence. In one form, the pump light is coupled into one end of the fiber and a dichroic filter is interposed in the light path between the pump light and the optical fiber to pass pump light into the core and reflect the spontaneous emission of the active material back into the core and toward the output.
