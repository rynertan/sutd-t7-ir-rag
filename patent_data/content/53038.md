Detailed Descriotion of the Invention The preferred processes used in preparing compounds of the invention I and II , pyrimidines of Formula III and sulfonylureas of Formula VI , illustrated heretofore in Reactions A through F, are more fully described as follows Reaction A illustrates the process for preparing comoounds of the invention I . According to this process, a substituted 3 aminocrotononitrile of Formula Iv is reacted with an alcohol or mercaptan in an inert liquid medium containing an excess of hydrogen chloride gas up to a 30 mole excess .The reaction is run at a temperature in the range of about 100C to 500C, preferably at about 100 to 50 C. In order to lessen or prevent side reactions, an excess of up to a moles of alcohol or mercaptan can be used, Dreferably about a 0.5 to 1 mole excess. Also, in order to lessen or prevent side reactions, the hydrogen chloride gas and the alcohol or mercaotan can be added first to the liquid medium and then the substituted 3 aminocrotono nitrile IV can be added. Preferably, IV is added at a low temperture, about 30C, and then the reaction mass is warmed to about room temperature. The liquid medium used in the reaction can be any inert liquid that provides suitable solubility for the reactants.Suitable liquids include chloroform, dioxane, methanol and methyl acetate. Methyl acetate is the preferred solvent. The reaction time is ordinarily about 1 to 24 hours, Preferably about 3 to 6 hours. Reaction A can be further exemplified by the following procedure To a solution of about 400 ml methyl acetate saturated with hydrogen chloride gas and containing 1.7 mole of alcohol or mercaptan cooled to about O C is added a solution containing 1.2 mole of a 3 aminocrotononitrile IV dissolved in methyl acetate. After addition is complete, coolinq is removed and the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for about 1 to 24 hours, cooled, and the product I is isolated by filtration. The starting substituted 3 aminocrotononitriles IV described herein are known in the art and can be prepared by several methods, examples of which are described in the following references D. J.

According to this process, a two step sequence is used which can be more fully illustrated as follows EMI8.1 In the first step of Reaction B, the dihydrochloride salt of Formula I is contacted with one equivalent weight of a base in an inert liquid medium to produce a monohydrochloride salt Ia . The pH should be no higher than about 7 when an aqueous medium is used. The base is preferably an alkali metal preferably sodium bicarbonate, carbonate, hydroxide or methoxide, pyridine or triethylamine or other tertiary amine base . Sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate or sodium hydroxide are ordinarily used as their aqueous solutions.The liquid medium used to suspend or dissolve the reactants can be any liquid inert to the reaction. Typical liquids are halogenated compounds such as CH2C12 or CHCl3, ethers such as diethyl ether or dioxane, esters such as methyl acetate or ethyl acetate, alcohols such as methanol or ethanol, hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, hexane and cyclohexane, and water. Methylene chloride and water are the ore ferred liquid mediums. The pH of an aqueous reaction mixture is preferably maintained in the range of 5 7.Temperature of the reaction is preferably in the range of about 100C to about 200C. In the second step of Reaction B, the monohydrochloride salt Ia is contacted with cyanamide to produce a compound of the invention II . Generally, a 0 80 molar excess of cyanamide is used, preferably as 50 aaueous cyanamide. The temperature of the reaction is usually in the range of about l0 400C, preferably about 15 300C. The reaction time is usually about 30 minutes to 2 hours. It is an important part of this invention that at higher temperatures or reaction times longer than about 2 hours, II can be further converted to pyrimidine III , more fully described hereinafter. Reaction B can be carried out by any one of the following procedures 1 Step 1 solid dihydrochloride salt I is suspended in any one of the described organic liquid mediums and then contacted with one equivalent of base at 10 to 200C to form monohydrochloride salt Ia .Step 2 an excess about 10 to 80S molar excess of cyanamide, preferably as 50 aqueous cyanamide, is added and the reaction mass is warmed to 200 to 300C where it is held for 30 minutes to 2 hours. Water is then added to dissolve the salts present. The aqueous phase is separated from the organic phase and II is isolated from the organic phase by evaooration of the solvent with vacuum at less than 300C 2 Step 1 solid dihydrochloride salt I is added to one equivalent of one of the preferred aqueous bases, e.g., Na2C03, NaHC03 or NaOH, in water at 10 to 200C to form monohydrochloride salt Ia .Step 2 an excess about 10 to 80 molar excess of 50 aqueous cyanamide is added and the solution is warmed to room temoerature where it is held for 30 minues to 2 hours. Solid product II , which precipitates during this time, is then isolated by filtration 3 Step 1 a suspension of dihydrochloride salt I in one of the described organic liquid mediums is added simultaneously with one equivalent of an aqueous base to ice water, maintaining a pH of 5 7 by regulating the addition rate of either stream, to produce monohydrochloride salt Ia . Step 2 an excess about 10 to 80 molar excess of 50 aqueous cyanamide is then added and the two phase mixture warmed to room temperature where it is held for about 30 minutes to 2 hours.Water is then added to dissolve any salts present, and the reaction is worked up as described in 1 to produce product II 4 solid dihydrochloride salt I is suspended in methanol and then contacted with one equivalent of sodium methoxide at 100 to 10 C to form monohydrochloride salt Ia . The salt Ia is isolated as a precipitate by a filtering the mixture to remove the NaCl formed, b evaporating the methanol from the filtrate under vacuum at less than 300, c adding a suitable organic liquid such as acetone, methylacetate or diethyl ether to preciPitate Ia , and d isolating Ia by filtration.Step 2 solid Ia is then suspended in one of the described organic liquid mediums and contacted with an excess about 10 to 80 molar excess of cyanamide, preferably as 50 aqueous cyanamide, and the reaction mass is stirred at room temperature for a period of 30 minutes to 2 hours. Water is then added and the mixture is worked up as described in 1 to produce product II . The preferred procedure is 1 or 2 because of ease of synthesis and higher yields of oroduct II . Reactions C, D and E illustrate the processes of this invention for preparing pyrimidines of Formula III which are useful as herbicide intermediates. As illustrated in Reaction C, compounds of the invention II can be caused to undergo ring closure to pyrimidines III by heating. Preferably, compound II is dissolved or suspended in a suitable inert liquid medium such as water, methanol, toluene or xylene and maintained at a temperature in the range of about 0 to 1400C, preferably about 40 1100C, until the rearrangement is comolete. Alternatively, ring closure can be accomplished by heating the neat compound of Formula 11 to a temperature above its melting point for a suitable period of time. Reaction C is exemplified by one of the following procedures 1 a solution or suspension of II in an inert liquid medium is heated to tLO 1100C until rearrangement is complete about .1 to 3 hours at 400C to about 30 minutes at 110 C then the solution or susoension is cooled and pyrimidine III isolated by filtration or evaporation of solvent 2 a compound of Formula 11 is heated neat to its melting point, e.g., when R and R2 are methyl and R1 is H and X is 0, heating to about 1200C will give ring closure in less than one minute. The ring closure reaction of either procedure 1 or 2 is highly exothermic and can lead to boiling of the liquid or a considerable rise in temperature of the melt when II is heated neat. Alternatively, as illustrated in Reaction D, dihydrochloride salt I can be converted directly to pyrimidine III . The process can be considered to occur as follows EMI11.1 Intermediates Ia and II are already described inReaction B . According to this process, dihydrochloride salt I is contacted with one equivalent weight of a base at a pH no higher than about 7 in an inert liquid medium, followed by the addition of cyanamide. The resultant reaction mass is then heated to a temoerature in the range of about 250 to 1000C for a time sufficient to produce pyrimidine III up to 24 hours at 250C and to about one hour.at 1000C . The base is ordinarily contacted with the dihydrochloride salt I at a temperature in the range of about 100 to 200C. Typical bases that can be used include alkali metal preferably sodium bicarbonate, hydroxide or methoxide, pyridine or triethylamine or other tertiary amine bases . Sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate or sodium hydroxide are usually used as their aqueous solutions.The preferred bases are pyridine and triethylamine or other tertiary amine bases . Suitable inert liquid mediums in which the reaction can be run include halogenated compounds such as CH2C12 or CHC13, ethers such as dioxane or tetrahydrofuran, esters such as methyl acetate or ethyl acetate, hydrocarbons such as benzene or toluene, and water. The preferred liquid mediums are methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, methyl acetate and toluene. Preferably, an equivalent or sliqht excess about 10 of cyanamide is used in the reaction. The cyanamide can be added to the reaction mass as a solid, as a solution or suspension in one of the described organic liquid mediums, or as a 50 aqueous solution. The above mentioned pH limitation, as elsewhere herein, is to be understood as applying to aqueous systems. Reaction D is more fully exemplified by one of the following procedures 1 solid dihydrochloride I is suspended in any one of the described non aqueous liquid mediums and one equivalent of a base is added. After a few minutes, one equivalent or a slight excess about 10 of cyanamide is added, and the reaction mass is heated at about 40 800C until the reaction is complete up to 5 hours at 400C and to 2 hours at 800C . Water is then added to dissolve any salts present.Any undissolved product III is isolated by filtration, then the aqueous phase is separated from the prganic phase and additional III is isolated from the organic phase by evaporation of the solvent at reduced pressure 2 The procedure in 1 above is carried out except that one equivalent or a slight excess about 10 of 50 aqueous cyanamide is used 3 solid dihydrochloride salt I is added to one equivalent of a base in water at about 10 to 10 C, followed by one equivalent or slight excess about 10 of 50 aqueous cyanamide. The resultant reaction mass is warmed to room temperature where it is held for about 2 hours and then heated at a temperature in the range of 25 100 C until the reaction is complete up to 24 hours at 250C to about 1 hour at 1000C .After cooling, solid product III which precipitates during this time, is isolated by filtration. The preferred procedure is 1 or 2 above because of ease of synthesis and generally higher yields of product III . An alternate process for preoaring pyrimidine III is illustrated in Reaction E, and is more fully described as follows EMI14.1 In the first step, dihydrochloride salt I is contacted with two equivalents of a base at a pH no higher than about 8 in an inert liquid medium to form imidate Ib . The base is preferably an alkali metal or alkaline earth carbonate or hydroxide and more preferably an alkali metal carbonate such as sodium or potassium carbonate. Preferably, the salt I , which is suspended in an inert organic liquid medium, is added to an aqueous solution of the base. Suitable liquid mediums include CHCl3 and CH2C12, the latter being preferred. The aqueous base to solvent ratio is preferably about 1 1 although higher or lower ratios are operable.The reaction mixture is cooled to maintain a temperature within the range of about 100 to 500C. The imidate product is contained in the organic phase. The first step of Reaction E is exemDlified by the following procedure A suspension of I in one of the described liquid mediums is added to a solution or suspension of at least two equivalents of an aqueous base in ice water. The organic phase containing the product Ib is removed and the water layer is further extracted with additional organic solvent. The combined organic solutions are dried over magnesium sulfate or sodium sulfate. If a different solvent is to be used in the first step, evaporation of solvent at reduced pressure will yield an oily product. In the second step, imidate Ib is contacted with cyanogen chloride in an inert liquid medium to prepare a mixture of the monohydrochloride salt Ia and N cyanoimidate II . The reactants are combined in the organic layer retrieved from the first step, or, if the imidate has been isolated, in an inert organic solvent. Suitable solvents include methylene chloride, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, with methylene chloride being preferred. The cyanogen chloride is preferably in the amount of about one half to about one mole per mole of imidate. The reaction is run at a temperature of about OOC to 800C, preferably about 200 to 450C. When the solvent used is methylene chloride, pressure must be aDplied to achieve temperatures above reflux. The reaction time will vary with the temperature selected.For example, at the reflux temperature of methylene chloride, a reaction time of approximately 3 hours is required. The monohydrochloride salt Ia precipitates during the reaction. Thus, the N cyanoimidate II may be isolated by filtration followed by evaporation of the solvent. As part of the process, it is recognized that for some thermally unstable N cyanoimidates II , ring closure to pyrimidines III may occur, either partially or totally, during the heating phase of the second step. For those cases, pyrimidine III andN cyanoimidate II are isolated by a filtering and evaporating the filtrate to obtain N cyanoimidate II plus any pyrimidine III dissolved in the solvent, and b isolating any insoluble pyrimidine III by washing the precipitate with water to remove the water soluble monohydrochloride Ib . It is also recognized, as part of the process, that isomers can form when cyanogen chloride is reacted with imidate Ib , as illustrated by formulas 11 and via . EMI16.1 The presence of isomers is not critical, however, because both isomers can ring close to pyrimi dine III EMI16.2 The second step of Reaction E is exemplified by the following procedure Gas or liquid cyanogen chloride is added to the solution of Ib prepared in the first steo. Alternatively, solvent free Ib is dissolved or suspended in an inert liquid medium to which cyanogen chloride is added. The mixture is heated, and a precipitate of monohydrochloride salt Ia is formed. The mixture is cooled to 250C and filtered. The filtrate, which contains the desired N cyanoimidate II , plus any solvent soluble pyrimidine III formed during the reaction, is concentrated at reduced pressure to afford II plus III .The precipitate isolated during the filtration procedure is washed with water to remove the monohydrochloride salt Ia , leaving any insoluble pyrimidine III formed during the reaction. The monohydrochloride salt Ia formed during the reaction may be recycled to produce the imidate Ib by following the procedure of the first step.Unlike the first step, however, only one equivalent of base is needed to neutralize the salt. In the fourth step of Reaction E, the N cyanoimidate II or mixture of II plus pyrimidine III is converted to pyrimidine III by heating. Preferably, the N cyanoimidate or mixture of N cyanoimidate plus pyrimidine is dissolved or suspended in a suitable inert liquid medium such as water, methanol, toluene or xylene and maintained at a temperature in the range of about 0 to 1100C, preferably about 400C to 800C, until the rearrangement is complete. Alternatively, ring closure can be accomplished by heating the neat compound or mixture of comoounds II and III to a temperature above the melting point of II for a suitable period of time. The fourth step of Reaction E is exemplified by the following procedure 1 a solution or suspension of II , or II plus III , in an inert liquid medium is heated at 40 1100C until rearrangement is complete several hours at 400C to about 30 minutes at 1100C . Then the solution or suspension is cooled and the pyrimidine III is isolated by filtraton or evaporation of the solvent 2 a compound of Formula II , or a mixture of II plus a compound of Formula III , is heated neat to the melting point of II . For example, when X is 0, R and R2 are CH3 and R1 is H, heating to about 1200C will give ring closure in less than one minute. Because of ease of synthesis and generally higher yields of product, the preferred process for preparing pyrimidine III is the process described as Reaction D.

Accordinq to the process, the aryl group of the sulfonylisocyanate may be a benzaromatic, naphthylaromatic or heteroaromatic ring, such as 2 methoxycarbonylphenyl , 2 chloronaphthalen l yl , 2 chloropyridin 3 yl , and 2 methoxy carbonylthien 3 yl . The process comprises reacting the N cyanoimidate II with one equivalent or slight excess 5 to 10 of arylsulfonylisocyanate V in an inert liquid medium at 100C to 50 C for 5 minutes to 3 hours.The pyrimidino arylsulfonylureas VI formed are readily isolated by filtration or evaporation procedures.Suitable inert liquid mediums include halocarbons such as CH2C12 or CHCl3, ethers such as dioxane or tetrahydrofuran, hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene, esters such as ethyl acetate or methyl acetate and acetonitrile. Reaction F is exemplified by the following procedure 1 to a solution or suspension containing N cyanoimidate II is added at 0 C to 300C a solution containing one equivalent or a slight excess about 10 of arylsulfonylisocyanate V the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1 to 3 hours, and the sulfonylurea VI is isolated by filtration or evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure. As part of the invention, it is recognized thatN cyanoimidate II may be converted to pyrimidine III under the conditions of reactions described above. Any pyrimidine, preformed or formed under these conditions, will also react with the arylsulfonylisocyanate to form sulfonylurea VI in good yields, as illustrated heretofore in Reaction G. The processes of this invention are further illustrated by the following examples in which parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated. ExamPle 1 A solution of 67.2 9 methanol in 488 ml methyl acetate was cooled at 00C and saturated with hydrogen chloride gas. Next, a solution of 100 g 3 aminocrotononitrile 85 pure dissolved in 366 ml methyl acetate was slowly added while still cooling the reaction solution at OOC. Cooling was then removed and the solution was stirred at room temperature 6 hours, with precipi tation starting after about 0.5 hours of stirring. The mixture was then cooled to SOC, filtered and the solid methyl 3 amino 2 butenimidate 2HC1 was washed with excess methyl acetate and dried under nitrogen atmosphere yield 178 g, m.p. 99 1020C. Analysis Calculated for C5H12N2C120 C, 32.1 H 6.5 N, 14.9. Found C, 31.7 H, 6.1 N, 14.9. Example 2 To a suspension of 12.6 g NaHC03 in 130 ml water cooled at 0 C was added portionwise 30 9 of methyl 3 amino 2 butenimidate 2HC1 Example 1 . To the resulting sqlution was added in one portion 25 g of 50 aqueous cyanamide and the solution was warmed to room temperature where it was held for 45 minutes.Solid methyl 3 amino.N cyano 2 butenimidate precipitated during this time which was removed by filtration, after having cooled the mixture to 50C yield 9 g, m.p. 114.1170 C. A portion of the solid was recrystallized from acetone at less than 300C by dissolving the solid in excess acetone and evaporating the solvent at room temperature under vacuum until precipitation started.The mixture was then cooled to 50C and filtered to give pure methyl 3 amino N cyano 2 butenimidate m.p. 123 1250C. Analysis Calculated for C6H9N30 C, 51.8 H, 6.5 N, 30.2. Found C, 51.9 H, 6.5 N, 30.1. Examole 3 To a suspension of 9.4 g methyl 3 amino 2 butenimidate dihydrochloride in 100 ml methylene chloride was added dropwise 5.1 g triethylamine while cooling the suspension at 5 150C. After stirring the mixture for several minutes, 6.5 g of 50 aqueous cyanamide was added in one portion. The mixture was then warmed to room temperature where it was stirred for 1.5 hours, then diluted with 25 ml of water. The organic phase was separated, dried over Na2SO4, and evaporated under vacuum at less than 300C to give crude methyl 3 amino.N.cyano.2 butenimidate yield 3.8 g, m.p. 115 1180C. Example 4 One gram of crude product from Example 2 was heated in a test tube with the aid of an oil bath to about 1200C, at which point a sudden release of energy raised the temperature of the melt to 1750C. The melt was then cooled and solidified. The resulting product melted at 155 158 and its IR spectrum was identical with pure 2 amino 4 methoxy 6 methylpyrimidine. Example 5 A suspension of 4 g of crude product from Example 2 in methanol was heated at 50 600C for 30 minutes.The methanol was evaporated from the mixture to give 2 amino 4.methoxy.6 methylpyrimidine in quantitative yield, m.p. 155 1580C. Example 6 To a suspension of 9.4 g methyl 3 amino 2 butenimidate dihydrochloride in 65 ml of methylene chloride was added dropwise 5.1 g of triethylamine while cooling the suspension at about 5.20OC. After stirring the resultant mixture about 5 minutes, a suspension of 2.1 q cyanamide in 10 ml of methylene chloride was added and the mixture was heated at 400C for 2 hours, then cooled to room temperature and diluted with 30 ml of water. Solid product, 2 amino 4 methoxy 6 methylpyrimidine, which precipitated during the reaction, was removed by filtration. Additional product was obtained by separating the aqueous phase from the filtrate and evaporating the organic phase to dryness. Solid product from the filtration and evaporation procedures were combined and dried to yield 6 g of 2 amino 4 methoxy 6 methylpyrimidine m.p. 154 1570C. Example 7 The procedure in Example 6 was repeated using 4.5 9 of 50 aqueous cyanamide instead of a suspension of cyanamide in methylene chloride. The mixture was heated at 400C for 2 hours. This reaction yielded 5.4 g of solid product, 2 amino 4 methoxy 6 methylpyrimidine m.p. 154 1570C. Example 8 To a suspension of 12.6 g sodium bicarbonate in 130 ml water at OOC was added, in small portions, at a pH greater than 4.5, 30 g of methyl 3 amino 2 butenimidate dihydrochloride Example 1 . To the resulting solution was added 13.5 g of 50 aqueous cyanamide and the solution was warmed to room temperature where it was held for 16 hours. Solid product, 2 amino 4 methoxy 6 methylpyrimidine, which precipitated during this time, was removed by filtration and dried yield 12 g, m.p. 155 1580C. The product was contaminated with a small amount of high melting impurity which was removed by washing the product with warm 1N aqueousNaOH. Example 9 The reaction in Example 8 was repeated except that the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours and then heated at 1000C for one hour. The reaction mixture was then cooled and filtered to give 11 g of 2 amino 4 methoxy 6 methylpyrimidine m.p. 155 1580C. A small amount of high melting impurity was removed by washing the product with warm 1N aqueous NaOH. Example 10 To a stirred mixture of 400 ml aqueous potassium carbonate 309 g liter and 400 ml methylene chloride, 73 9 of methyl 3 amino 2 butenimidate dihydrochloride is added in portions. The organic layer is removed, and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 80 ml portions of methylene chloride. The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and then filtered. The filtrate is evaporated to give methyl 3 amino 2 butenimidate as an oil. Example 11 A 3.5 ml portion of cyanogen chloride is added to a solution of 7.4 g of the product of Example 1D in 100 ml of methylene chloride. After the mixture is refluxed for 4 houXs the solvent is evaporated. The residue is washed with water to give crude 2 amino 4 methoxy 6 methylpyrimidine. The yield is increased by recycling the methyl 3 amino 2 butenimidate monohydrochloride by product dissolved in the water washing. Example 12 To a suspension of 2 g of methyl 3 amino N cyano2 butenimidate in 25 ml acetonitrile was added slowly a solution of 3 g of 2 chlorobenzenesulfonylisocyanate in 5 ml of acetonitrile. A mild exotherm occurred 250 350C as a solution formed followed by a preciDi tate within 5 minutes after the addition. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours, cooled to 50C and filtered to give the solid product, 2 chloro N 4.methoxy.6.methylpyrimidin 2 yl aminocarbonyl benzene.sulfonamide yield 4 g, m.p. 234 2060C.
