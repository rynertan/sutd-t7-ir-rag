## Description
This invention relates to novel N heterocyclic aminocarbonyl imidazolesulfonamides, pyrazolesulfonamides, thiazolesulfonamides and isothiazolesulfonamides, to herbicidal compositions containing them and to methods of using them to control the growth of undesired vegetation. New compounds effective for controlling the growth of undesired vegetation are in constant demand. In the most common situation, such compounds are sought to selectively control the growth of weeds in useful crops such as cotton, rice, corn, wheat and soybeans, to name a few. Unchecked weed growth in such crops can cause significant losses, reducing profit to the farmer and increasing costs to the consumer. In other situations, herbicides are desired which will control all plant growth. Examples of areas in which complete control of all vegetation is desired are areas around fuel storage tanks, ammunition depots and industrial storage areas. There are many products commercially available for these purposes, but the search continues for products which are more effective, less costly and environmentally safe. A number of different types of N heterocyclic aminocarbonyl arylsulfonides are known as herbicides. Two of the first patents to issue on such compounds are U.S. Patents 4,169,719 and 4,127,405, issued on October 2, 1979 and November 28, 1978, respectively. These patents disclose compounds of the general formula where W can be O or S, Z can be N or CH, and R is optionally substituted benzene, optionally substituted thiopene, optionally substituted furan or naphthalene. Later publications have disclosed similar compounds were R₁ is a thiophene or pyrrole. See, for example, EP A 41,404 EP A 64,804 EP A 30,142 and EP A 39,239. Nowhere in the art is there a disclosure of N heterocyclic aminocarbonyl imidazole , pyrazole, thiazole, or isothiazolesulfonamides of any indication that such novel compounds would be useful as herbicides. However, EP A 87,780 and EP A 96,003 are relevant merely to the novelty of this invention in some designated states, and for this reason the appended claims for such states contain some additional limitations. It has now been found that the compounds of Formula I have utility as plant growth regulants and or herbicides. where R is H or CH₃ Q is R₁ is H, C₁ C₈ alkyl, C₃ C₆ alkenyl, C₅ C₆ cycloalkyl, C₅ C₆ cycloalkenyl, C₃ C₆ alkynyl, C₄ C₇ cycloalkylalkyl, R₁₇CH or C, C₆, alkyl substituted either with and agriculturally suitable salts thereof. This invention therefore relates to compounds of Formula I as set out in this claims, to herbicidal compositions containing the compounds and to methods of using the compounds to control the growth of undesired vegetation. Certain groups of compounds are preferred because of their high herbicidal and or plant growth regulant activity and or because of the ease with which they may be prepared. These preferred groups are as follows The following compounds are specifically preferred because of their high herbicidal and or plant growth regulant activity and or because of the ease with which they may be synthesized.

The sulfonylureas of this invention can be prepared by a number of methods. These methods, and the publications or sources describing them are as follows As shown in Equation 1, an appropriately substituted sulfonyl isocyanate a is reacted with an appropriate aminoheterocycle b . The reaction is best carried out in an inert aprotic solvent, such as methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, ether or chloroform, at temperatures ranging from about 20 to 50 C. in some cases, the desired product may crystallize from the reaction medium amd may be filtered. Reaction products which are soluble in the reaction medium may be isolated by evaporation of the solvent, tituration of the residue with solvents such as diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, 1 chlorobutane or hexane. Chromatography e.g., silica gel may also be necessary for purification. The process is described in U.S. Patents, 4,127,405, 4,257,802 and 4,221,585. As shown in Equation 2, compounds of Formula I can also be prepared by reacting a sulfonamide e with an appropriate methyl carbamate d in the presence of an equimolar amount of trimethylaluminium. The reaction is best run in an inert aprotic solvent such as methylene chloride at about 25 to 40 C for 10 to 96 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere. The product can be isolated by addition of an aqueous acetic acid solution followed by extraction of the product into methylene chloride, or by filtration of a product of low solubility. The product can be purified by trituration with solvents such as 1 chlorobutane, ethyl acetate or ethyl ether or by column chromatography on silica gel. Examples of other methods for preparing compounds of this invention are illustrated in Equations 3 and 4 and described in our EP A 30,140. The first step of this two step process Equation 3 involves reacting of a diazole sulfonamide and a heterocyclic isocyanate to yield a N haloheterocyclicaminocarbonyl aromatic sulfonamide f . This reaction is best run in an inert organic solvent such as acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, acetone or butanone, preferably at a temperature of about 25 to 110 C. The product can then be further reacted with selected nucleophiles, for example alkoxide OR , Equation 4 to yield herbicidal N substituted heterocyclicaminocarbonyl aromatic sulfonamides of this invention. European Patent Application 81810282.4, published January 27, 1982 European Patent Application 81810282.4, published January 27, 1982 Equations 5 to 6 illustrate two additional methods for preparing the compounds of this invention. As shown in Equation 5, a diazole sulfonamide e is reacted with an N heterocyclic carbamate g in the presence of a base. Alternatively, in Equation 6, an N phenylsulfonylcarbamate h is reacted with an amine b . Both of these processes are described in our EP A 44,807. Both reactions are best carried out in aprotic, inert organic solvents such as methylene chloride, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, dioxane and toluene, at temperatures between 20 and 120 C. Suitable bases for use in the process of Equation 5 are organic bases such as amines and inorganic bases such as hydrides, hydroxides, carbonates and bicarbonates.

X This method is known to those skilled in the art and is carried out in a manner analogous to the process outlined in Equation 7. Many of the sulfonamides of Formula c are known in the art or can be prepared from known imidazole intermediates by chemical transformations known to those skilled in the art. General literature references describing the chemistry of imidazoles include Elderfield, Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds, Vol. V, p. 194 297, 1957, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York. T. Kauffman and R. Werthwein, Angew Chem., Int. Ed. Engl, M. R. Grimmett, Adv. Heterocycl. Chem. 12. 104 184 1970 . The preparation of substituted nitro imidazolesulfonamides of Formulas c 3 and c 4 Q is Q 2 or Q 3 and R₅ and R₈ are NO₂ is shown in Equation 12. where R₄ and R₈ are H R₆ and R₉ are H, CH₃ or CH₂C₆H₅ X This process is as described in B. S. Huang. M. J. Lauzon and J. C. Parham, J. Het. Chem.

The preparation of 4 5 bromo imidazole The preparation of additional intermediates for use in preparing the compounds of this invention from readily available imidazole intermediates is outlined in Scheme 1. The preparation of 4 chloro or bromo 5 nitro imidazole Protection of the imidazole nitrogen for futher manipulation of the ring is accomplished with such groups as CH₃OCH₂ or CH₃OCH₂CH₂O CH₂ . These groups can be introduced and removed by procedures taught in C. Tang, D. Davalian, P. Huang, and R. Breslow, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 3918 1978 and E. J. Corey, J. L. Cras and P. Ulrich, Tet. Let. 809 1976 . Protection and deprotection can also be accomplished with groups such as by procedures taught in T. Brown, G., Shaw and G. Durrant, J. C. S. Perkin I 2310, 1980 . Protection of the imidazole as shown in Scheme 1 leads to a mixture of isomers The mixture is used without separation of the isomers in the following steps, since deprotection of either isomer eventually leads to the same product Introduction of R₅ or R₈ as F can be accomplished by procedures taught in U.S. Patent 4,069,262 in which fluoronitrobenzene is produced from chloronitrobenzene by displacement with KF and CsF as catalyst. Replacement of halogen in Compounds of Formulas Conditions for carrying out the transformations outlined in Scheme 2 are known in the art. For example, see M. H. Fisher, W. H. Nicholson and R. S. Stuart, Can. J. Chem., Compounds of Formula Reduction of nitroimidazoles shown in Scheme 1 of Formulas Imidazoles of Formula in which R₄ is H or CH₃ and R₅ is H or C₁ C₄ alkyl are produced by nitration of the corresponding imidazole using procedures well known in imidazole chemistry. For example, see V. K. Bhagwat and F. L. Pyman, J. Chem. Soc., Conversion of analogous to those outlined in Scheme 1. Functionalization of This procedure carried out under typical conditions for alkylating or acylating nitrogen, produces the mixture of isomeric sulfonamides in which R₄ is H or CH₃ and R₂₃ is C₁ C₃ alkyl or allyl and P is a suitable protecting group such as are prepared from the corresponding amino compound by diazotization, followed by coupling with SO₂ and HCl in the presence of a copper catalyst. The sulfonyl chlorides produced are converted to the sulfonamides by treatment with ammonia solution. This procedure is outlined in Scheme 4. Protected amino esters Intermediates of Formula c in which Q is Q 4, Q 5 or Q 6 may be prepared by procedures analogous to those outlined above for the imidazole intermediates. A number of references are available which teach chemical transformations and preparation of pyrazole intermediates needed for this invention. For example A. N. Kost and I. I. Groundberg, Advan. Heterocyclic Chem T. L. Jacobs, In Heterocyclic Compounds R. C. Elderfield, ed. , Vol. 5, pp. 45 161, Wiley, New York, 1957. Many of the compounds of Formula c in which Q is Q 4 or Q 5, for example The procedure of Equation 13 is suitable for those substituents which can survive the pyrazole metallation for example R₁₂ is H or CH₃, R₁₀ is C₁ C₄ alkyl, C₃ C₄ alkenyl, C₃ C₄ alkynyl or SO₂NR₂₀R₂₁. Metallation reactions of pyrazoles are discussed in H. W. Gschwend and H. R. Rodriguez, Organic Reactions , Vol. 26, p. 23, 24, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1979. For the pyrazoles cited above, as well as pyrazoles with groups sensitive to metallation conditions, the procedure of Scheme 5 can be used. For example, compounds in which R₁₀ and R₁₂ are as defined for Formula I and R₁₁ is H, C₁ C₃ alkyl, F, Cl, Br, OR₁₆, S O ₂NR₂₀R₂₁ may be prepared, Suitable protecting groups include CH₂OCH₂CH₂OCH₃ and Compounds of Formulas Compounds of Formula c in which The chlorosulfonation of pyrazoles TPE or CH₂OCH₂CH₂OCH₃ MEM . For details of this procedure with TPE see H. W. Gschwend and H. R. Rodriguez Organic Reactions , Vol. The lithiation of protected pyrazoles and subsequent reactions with electrophiles is taught in H. W. Gschwend and H. R. Rodriguez Organic Reactions , Vol. 26, p. 24, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1979. Further reactions of Deprotection of the sulfonamide and pyrazole is accomplished with an acid such as trifluoroacetic acid. Use of HCl in an alcohol R₂₄OH lead simultaneously to esterification and deprotection to yield sulfonamide Alkylthio, alkylsulfinyl and alkylsulfonyl analogs are produced from The halo derivatives Treatment of heteroaryllithium reagents with halogens is well known in the art. Details are available in H. W. Gschwend and H. R. Rodriguez Organic Reactions , Vol. 26, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1979. Using similar procedures, the analogous compounds in which R₁₄ is C₁ C₃ alkyl Sulfonamides of Formula c where Q is Q 7, Q 8, Q 9 or Q 10 can be prepared by amination of the corresponding sulfonyl chlorides of Formula 83 by methods well known in the art. The intermediate sulfonyl chlorides of Formula 83 can be prepared by one of the methods shown in Equation 17. In Equations 17A and 17B, a solution or a suspension of a benzyl sulfide of Formula 84 or a thiol of Formula 85 in aqueous acetic acid is treated with at least three molar equivalents of chlorine at temperatures of about 0 to 15 . The sulfonyl chloride of Formula 83 can be isolated by dilution of the reaction mixture with water, followed by either filtration or extraction with an organic solvent such as ether, methylene chloride or 1 chlorobutane. In Equation 17C, a bromide of Formula 86 is treated with one molar equivalent of In Equation 17D, a heterocycle of Formula 87 is treated with an excess of chlorosulfonic acid at temperatures of about ambient to the boiling point of chlorosulfonic for periods of from several hours to several days. The sulfonyl chlorides of Formula 83 can be isolated by pouring the reaction mixture into ice water, and either filtering the product of extracting it into an organic solvent. In Equation 17E, a heterocyclic amine of Formula 88 is diazotized with sodium nitrite in a mixture of water, concentrated hydrochloric acid and acetic acid at temperatures from about 5 to 10 . The resulting diazonium salt is added to a mixture of sulfur dioxide, cuprous or cupric chloride, concentrated hydrochloric acid and acetic acid, and the reaction mixture is stirred at temperatures from about 0 to ambient. The sulfonyl chloride of Formula 83 can be isolated by diluting the reaction mixture with water and either filtration or extraction with an organic solvent. Agriculturally suitable salts of compounds of Formula I are also useful herbicides and can be prepared in a number of ways known to the art. For example, metal salts can be made by treating compounds of Formula I with a solution of alkali or alkaline earth metal salt having a sufficiently basic anion e.g., hydroxide, alkoxide, carbonate or hydride . Quaternary amine salts can be made by similar techniques. Salts of compounds of Formula I can also be prepared by exchange of one cation for another. Cationic exchange can be effected by direct treatment of an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of Formula I e.g., alkali metal or quaternary amine salt with a solution containing the cation to be exchanged. This method is most effective when the desired salt containing the exchanged cation is insoluble in water, e.g., a copper salt, and can be separated by filtration. Exchange may also be effected by passing an aqueous solution of a salt of a compound of Formula I e.g., an alkali metal or quaternary amine salt through a column packed with a cation exchange resin containing the cation to be exchanged. In this method, the cation of the resin is exchanged for that of the original salt and the desired product is eluted from the column. This method is particularly useful when the desired salt is water soluble, e.g., a potassium, sodium or calcium salt. Acid addition salts, useful in this invention, can be obtained by reacting a compound of Formula I or II with a suitable acid, e.g., The preparation of the compounds of this invention is further illustrated by the following specific examples.

By the methods described in Examples 1 26, or modifications thereof, the compounds of Tables I X may be prepared. Useful formulations of the compounds of Formula I can be prepared in conventional ways. They include dusts, granules, pellets, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates and the like. Many of these may be applied directly. Sprayable formulations can be extended in suitable media and used at spray volumes of from a few liters to several hundred liters per hectare. High strength compositions are primarily used as intermediates for further formulation. The formulations, broadly, contain about 0.1 to 99 by weight of active ingredient s and at least one of a about 0.1 to 20 surfactant s and b about 1 to 99 solid or liquid diluent s . More specifically, they will contain these ingredients in the following approximate proportions Lower or higher levels of active ingredient can, of course, be present depending on the intended use and the physical properties of the compound. Higher ratios of surfactant to active ingredient are sometimes desirable, and are achieved by incorporation into the formulation or by tank mixing. Typical solid diluents are described in Watkins, et al, Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers , 2nd Ed., Dorland Books, Caldwell, New Jersey, but other solids, either mined or manufactured, may be used. The more absorptive diluents are preferred for wettable powders and the denser ones for dusts. Typical liquid diluents and solvents are described in Marsden, Solvents Guide , 2nd Ed., Interscience, New York, 1950. Solubility under 0.1 is preferred for suspension concentrates solution concentrates are preferably stable against phase separation at 0 C. McCutcheon s Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual , MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood, New Jersey, as well as Sisely and Wood, Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents , Chemical Publishing Co., Inc., New York, 1964, list surfactants and recommended uses. All formulations can contain minor amounts of additives to reduce foaming, caking, corrosion, microbiological growth, etc. The methods of making such compositions are well known. Solutions are prepared by simply mixing the ingredients. Fine solid compositions are made by blending and, usually, grinding as in a hammer or fluid energy mill. Suspensions are prepared by wet milling see, for example. Littler, U.S. Patent 3,060,084 . Granules and pellets may be made by spraying the active material upon preformed granular carriers or by agglomeration techniques. See J. E. Browning, Agglomeration , For further information regarding the art of formulation, see for example H. M.

The ingredients are blended, hammer milled until all the solids are essentially under 50 microns, re blended, and packaged. The ingredients are blended, coarsely hammer milled and then air milled to produce particles essentially all below 10 microns in diameter. The product is reblended before packaging. A slurry of wettable powder containing 25 solids is sprayed on the surface of attapulgite granules in a double cone blender. The granules are dried and packaged. The ingredients are blended, hammer milled and then moistened with about 12 water. The mixture is extruded as cylinders about 3 mm diameter which are cut to produce pellets about 3 mm long. These may be used directly after drying, or the dried pellets may be crushed to pass a U.S.S. No. 20 sieve 0.84 mm openings . The granules held on a U.S.S. No. 40 sieve 0.42 mm openings may be packaged for use and the fines recycled. The ingredients are ground together in a sand mill until the solid particles have been reduced to under about 5 microns. The resulting thick suspension may be applied directly, but preferably after being extended with oils or emulsified in water. The ingredients are thoroughly blended. After grinding in a hammer mill to produce particles essentially all below 100 microns, the material is re blended and sifted through a U.S.S. No. 50 sieve 0.3 mm opening and packaged. The active ingredient is dissolved in the solvent and the solution is sprayed upon dedusted granules in a double cone blender. After spraying of the solution has been completed, the blender is allowed to run for a short period and then the granules are packaged. The ingredients are blended and ground together in a sand mill to produce particles essentially all under 5 microns in size. The salt is added directly to the water with stirring to produce the solution, which may then be packaged for use. The active ingredient is dissolved in a solvent and the solution is sprayed upon dedusted granules in a double cone blender. After spraying of the solution has been completed, the material is warmed to evaporate the solvent. The material is allowed to cool and then packaged. The ingredients are blended and milled to pass through a 100 mesh screen. This material is then added to a fluid bed granulator, the air flow is adjusted to gently fluidize the material, and a fine spray of water is sprayed onto the fluidized material. The fluidization and spraying are continued until granules of the desired size range are made. The spraying is stopped, but fluidization is continued, optionally with heat, until the water content is reduced to the desired level, generally less than 1 . The material is then discharged, screened to the desired size range, generally 14 100 mesh 1410 149 microns , and packaged for use. The ingredients are blended and ground in a hammer mill to produce a material essentially all passing a U.S.S. No. 50 screen 0.3 mm opening , the concentrate may be formulated further if necessary.

The ingredients are thoroughly blended, coarsely hammer milled and then air milled to produce particles essentially all below 10 microns in size. The material in reblended and then packaged. The ingredients are combined and ground together in a sand mill to produce particles essentially all below 5 microns. The product can be used directly, extended with oils, or emulsified in water. Test results indicate that the compounds of the present invention are powerful herbicides. Many of them have utility for broad spectrum pre and or post emergence weed control in areas where complete control of all vegetation is desired, such as around fuel storage tanks, ammunition depots, industrial storage areas, parking lots, drive in theatres, around billboards, highway and railroad structures. Alternatively, the subject compounds should be useful to modify plant growth. The rate of application for the compounds of the invention are determined by a number of factors, including their use as plant growth modifiers or as herbicides, the crop species involved, the types of weeds to be controlled, weather and climate, formulations selected, mode of application, amount of foliage present, etc. In general terms, the subject compounds should be applied at levels of around 0.02 to 10 kg ha, the lower rates being suggested for use on lighter soils and or those having a low organic matter content, for plant growth modification or for situations where only short term persistence is required. The compounds of the invention may be used in combination with any other commercial herbicide, examples of which are those of the triazine, triazole, uracil, urea, amide, diphenylether, carbamate and bipyridylium types. The herbicidal properties of the subject compounds were discovered in a number of greenhouse tests. The test procedures and results follow. Although some of the compounds do not exhibit a high degree of activity at the rate tested, it is expected that these compounds will exhibit herbicidal effects at higher rates. Seeds of crabgrass The ratings for the compounds tested by this procedure are presented in Table A. It will be seen that, at the low rates of application selected for this test, the compounds tested have utility for plant growth modification, and also are highly active herbicides.
