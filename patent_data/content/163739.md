## Description
This invention relates to methods of manufacturing Such fine powders are required, for example, for ceramic capacitors of small size, light weight and large capacitance, operable at high frequencies. To make thin and uniform ceramic layers, the dielectric material used must be formed into a fine powder, this also enabling a low sintering temperature to be used. Such fine powders can also form the raw material for electrostriction material, piezoelectric material and transparent ceramic material. As one such dielectric material, there is known barium titanate and barium zirconate solid solution, Many attempts have been made to overcome these problems, for example by using a metal alkoxide method as disclosed in Japanese examined patent application No. 58 2220. However, this method uses very expensive starting materials, and is difficult to practice. It has also been proposed GB A 1 225 719 to form calcium zirconate impregnated with barium titanate at high temperature using a mix muller, the resulting product then being subjected to calcination. According to the present invention there is provided a method of manufacturing The fine powder may be rinsed with water or hot water to remove alkali ions such as, K For the Zr compound, it is possible to use an aqueous solution made by dissolving For the Ti compound, it is possible to use an aqueous solution of For the Ba salt, there can be used As the reaction condition for synthesizing BZT fine powder, it is preferably that the pH is selected to be equal to or higher than 13.5 when x is in a range of 0 x It is preferably that the reaction temperature is selected to be equal to or higher than 80 C when x is in a range of 0 x The molar ratio of The reaction time may be very short once the reaction begins, when x is in a range of 0 x Using methods according to this invention, BZT solid solution fine powder with good crystalline properties can be synthesized from the liquid phase. High uniformity, high purity, and high uniformity of the ratio x can be achieved. Although the prior art solid phase reaction method requires calcining and firing at high temperature, but with these wet synthesizing methods, the BZT solid solution is already made, so that the calcining process can be omitted, and the firing temperature lowered. Therefore, differences in Curie temperatures and electrostatic characteristics due to different firing temperatures can be substantially decreased and the reliability can be increased. Moreover, due to the uniform particle diameter, non uniformity upon moulding and porosity upon sintering are decreased. As no granulating and mixing processes are necessary, there is no risk that impurities such as Fe or Al will be mixed into the fine powder, and hence scattered electrostatic characteristics due to such impurities do not occur. In addition, unlike the metal alkoxide in the alkoxide method mentioned above, the starting materials are inexpensive materials such as The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figures 1A, 1B and 1C are diagrams showing X ray diffraction patterns of Figure 2 is a graph showing time dependence on producing BZT50 Figure 3 is a graph showing a composition state of BZT50 in its initial stage of reaction Figure 4 is a graph showing measured results of lattice constant with respect to BZT solid solution fine powder in which x takes various values and Figures 5, 6, 7 and 8 are photographs of BZT10, BZT20, BZT30 and BZT40 respectively taken by an electron microscope. The invention will now be described in greater detail with reference to examples. About 200 g of To make BZT20, 49.25 ml of Ti standard solution and 13.75 ml of Zr standard solution were put into a beaker to which 15.38 g of The results of X ray analysis Cu target and Ni filter of the substance produced by the above described processes are shown in Figure 1B, together with the analyzed results of In this case, each diffraction strength is normalized on the basis of the diffraction peak 110 . From these X ray diffraction patterns, it will be seen that BZT is shifted a little from the peak position of From the Ti standard solution and the Zr standard solution which were used in Example 1, 30.78 ml and 34.37 ml were respectively taken up so as to make BZT50. After adding 18.56 g of The measured composition state of BZT50, which is to be synthesized, in its initial state of reaction are shown by a curve C of Figure 3. As will be clear from this graph, during an initial period, a composition of the desired BZT50 is not made even at the boiling point temperature. Thereafter the composition shifts to the side containing a large amount of Ti, so converging to the composition of BZT50. In this graph, a lattice constant d 110 calculated from the diffraction peak position of 110 is plotted relative to time, and also a lattice constant d 110 of simple After 15.38 g of After 18.56 g of
