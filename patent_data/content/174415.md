## Description
A parallel system for the lighting of neon lamps, fluorescent lamps and similar Alessandro BRESSANPaolo SIMONESCHIPietro SFORNAItalyThe present invention concerns a system for the lighting of neon lamps, fluorescent lamps and further applications, characterized in the parallel arrangement of the components.It is already well known that actually neon lamps for signboards are lighted by means of transformers current elevators, showing on the secondary tensions between 1000 and 10.000 Volt, with different current intensity relating to the diameter of said tubes.More precisaly, intensities of 25 m A for lamps tubes of 12 and 15 mm are used, 50 m A for lamps tubes of 15 and 20 mm, and 100 m A for diameters of 20 and 22 mm.Said transformers are planned according to the length of the lamp tube in reason of 500 Volt for each linear meter of length of said lamp tube , with tension jumps of 500Volt, from 1000 to 10.000 Volt, so as to request the realisation of 57 different transformers, corresponding to 11 different tensions multiplied by three used intensities.Said request implies a large number of different transformers and this causes a situation of difficult finding and choice of the most adequate component.For example, the lighting of 18 19 meters of a 25 mm lamp tube , implies the use of a 9000 V transformer for 100 m A on the secondary and consequently a high danger condition for the installer and for normal use.Furthermore, the transformers of said last kind are little protected by security systems actually known like fuses, automatic switsches and similar, in consideration of the fact that they must also bear short circuits.A further disadvantage of said transformers is that they heat up very much, due to the fact that they always work at nominal current and it may happen that they burn, even if the realization criteria are good and improved.Usually, lamps up to three meters length are used therefore, if one transformer shall light an 18 m lamp tube , six lamps tubes in series will be used and, as it is known, if one element out of the whole series brakes, the whole system stops working and this means that a technician urgently must be called.Furthermore, the art shows parallel systems for the lighting of neon lamps tubes , characterized in impedances consisting in high inductance windings which are very expensive in their realization and rather encumbering. further, very oftenly said systems are not able to determine the prime of all parallel lamps tubes due to conducting difficulties of the contained gases. All this shows the need of medium and big installations for an alternative system, which is the aim of the present invention, characterized in a low production cost, a minimum encumbering, a considerable installation simplicity and perfect functioning.The system according to the present invention consists in a transformer for elevating the net tension up to 1200 Volt, with a current intensity corresponding to the absorption requests, wherein the lamps tubes to be lit are connected in parallel with one electrode directly to one end of the high tension, while between the other electrode of each lamp tube and the other end an element is placed having the function of limiting the current s intensity to the value requested for the lighting of each lamp tube leaving the remaining intensity at disposal.Said limiter element consists in a wire resistance of minimum cost, perfectly functioning in the presence of alternate current frequencies of 50 Hz. In a possible variant that may be applied to systems with very high frequencies current generators 5000 . 40.000Hz said limiter element consists, according to the present invention, in condensers C, the capacitive reactance thereof proving to be appropriate for determining the lighting of neon lamps tubes , according to the aim set forth. A main feature of the present invention consists in the variant with resistance limiters in a small metal tongue placed outside each lamp tube , applied to the glass thereof, which tongue allows to solve the problem of the prime as it is able to make the inner gas sensitive to the overtensions carried by the glass.The present invention will be explained more in detail hereinbelow relating to the enclosed drawings in which some embodiments are shown.Figure 1 shows the scheme of a parallel system for the lighting of neon lamps tubes , fluorescent lamps and similar.Figure 2 shows the scheme of a variant for currents at frequencies of 50 Hz, provided with limiters consisting in wire resistances R.Figure 3 shows a perspective view of a lamp tube provided with tongue M for making the inner gas sensitive to the overtensions carried by glass V.Figure 4 shows the scheme of a high frequency variant provided with limiters consisting in condensers C. Relating to the details of the drawings, the system comprises lamps tubes 1, 2, 3, ..., N arranged in parallel, each provided with the own limiter L at the ends of transformer T and a protection fuse F fed by the net. Tongue M is liable with the electrode of resistance R. The advantages of the system according to the present invention are many a single transformer T is provided for the whole system, with a protection fuse F against short circuit and over load a relatively low working tension easy installation turning out of teh only out of order lamp tube wherein the technician may easily find it and the whole system continues its working.In a variant according to the present invention, exchanges for light games may light the neon lamps tubes directly without any external transformer.
