## Description
DIAZOTYPE COMPOSITIONS AND MATERIALSBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention The invention relates to diazotypy and more particularly relates to improved diazotype compositions, materials and diazonium compound couplers used therein.Brief Description of the Prior Art The diazotype reproduction process is well known to the art and is described in great detail in tight SensitiveSystems by Jaromir Sonar, John Wiley Sons, Inc., N.Y. 1965, and in Reproduction Coating by E. Jahoda, 4thEdition, Andrews Paper Chemical Co., Inc., PortWashington, New York. In general, diazotype reproduction prints are obtained an an imagewise exposure of a light sensitive diazo material to ultraviolet light followed by development of the exposed diazotype material. There are several different methods available to develop the latent image imposed on the lightsensitive diazo material by the light exposure including ammonia development, amine development, thermal development and moist liquid development. 1 The light sensitive diazo material generally comprises a light sensitive diazo composition affixed to a support base such as paper or film such as polyethylene terephthalate film, cellulose acetate, or a polymeric resin coated, base support The light sensitive diazonium may comprise a light sensitive diazonium salt compound in admixture with diazo enhancing compounds Upon exposure of the light sensitive diazonium compound to ultraviolet light through a translucent original having opaque image portions, the unmasked portions of the diazonium salt are decomposed by the ultraviolet radiation whereas the masked portions are left undecomposed. The latent image created by the image wise exposure may then be developed by the methods described above. In the so called dry development process, the light sensitive diazo composition will contain, in addition to the light sensitive diazonium salt, an azo coupling agent or color former and an acidic coupling inhibitor. Development of the latent azo dye image is accomplished by placing the exposed diazo material in an alkaline atmosphere which neutralizes the acidic inhibitor, allowing the undecomposed diazonium salt and coupler to react to form an azo dye. The latent image is thereby developed. It is of great importance in the dry development processes that print development be obtained rapidly and that a minimum of premature development and other deterioration of diazotype materials occur during the time between their manufacture and their use, a period which may be of 6 months length or more. Unfortunately, most diazo compounds have low stability and tend to decompose quickly. The coupling reaction of a diazo composition containing a coupler unavoidably begins and continues at a very slow rate, immediately after the manufacture of the diazotype materials i.e., precoupling .Consequently, their shelf life is very limited unless efficient stabilizers are added to delay or block such reactions. Stabilizers for diazotype materials have several drawbacks. For example, they tend to slow the desired coupling reaction during development when it is supposed to occur rapidly They also may adversely influence the developed image appearance by reducing brilliance and shifting color shades. Many stabilizers are not compatible with diazo coating solutions because they rapidly form insoluble salts or complexes with diazo compounds or couplers. Azo dye couplers are organic compounds with active methylene groups or aromatic hydroxyl groups, and they may or may not also have carboxylic or sulfonic groups, the use of low molecular weight couplers and various phenol or resorcinol derivative types of couplers often produce desirable print dyes, but they tend to migrate from the diazotype composition layer during storage of the diazotype materials. Mono and dihydroxy naphthalene types of couplers do not migrate but are poorly soluble in acidic solutions.Their mono and disulfonated derivatives are mostly water and acid soluble but the better their solubility, the more they tend to migrate upon storage. From the diazotype material the migration of couplers results in a substantial loss of print dye when coupling is initiated during development. Moreover, the print dye color changes substantially if the diazotype composition contains a mixture of couplers with different migration tendencies. Thus, a freshly produced blackline diazotype composition may develop to a deep black dye and grey half tones, but after a month of storage, the same material will develop to flat dyes of brown or blue color depending upon which coupler tended to migrate more Azo dye couplers of larger molecular weight tend not to migrate, but they are often poorly soluble and have solution compatibility problems with diazoniums or commonly used stabilizers.They will not go in solution and may precipitate with one of the other diazonium composition components. It is an objective of this invention to overcome the above problems and to provide for diazo coating compositions to be more consistent in the development of print colors regarding shade and print dye density even after prolonged periods of storage. The invention also provides diazo coating preparations with improved solution compatibility.For example, it has been found that blackline diazotype compositions of the invention containing as a blue coupling component 2,7 dihydroxyn2phthalene 3,6 disulfonic acid sodium salt, upon aging, did not exhibit the usual print color shift towards brown, due to migration of the highly water soluble coupler. similarly no color shift towards blue occurred with easily migrating brown couplers such as chlororesorcinol or yellow couplers such as cyanoacet morpholide in the compositions of the invention. U. S. Patent 2,531,485 teaches the addition of secondary amines to diazotype compositions containing sulfonated hydroxynaphthalenes as couplers for improving print dye water fastness. However, such additions do not stop migration of the coupler upon storage of the diazotype material prior to printing the azo dye development. Mannich bases of alkyl phenols have been disclosed inU. S. Patents 2,946,684 and 3,139,341, as couplers with high actinic opacity of the azo dyes they form in diazotypes. Improved water solubility through formation of Mannich bases has been disclosed for 2 hydroxy naphthoic amides inU. S. Patent 3,433,960, and for 1 hydroxy 4 alkoxy naphthalenes 8 sulfonamides in U. S. Patent 3,664,840.However, none of these disclosures reveal or are concerned with coupler migration of highly water soluble couplers and inhibition of migration through conversion of such couplers into their Mannich bases. SUMMERY OF THE INVENTION The invention comprises a diazotype sensitizing composition, prepared with a a diazonium compound and b a coupling agent which comprises the reaction mixture obtained upon reaction of i a compound capable of coupling the diazonium compound a and having an enolic moiety selected from the group consisting of an aromatic compound of six carbon atoms, substituted with at least 2 hydroxy groups and having at least 3 hydrogen atoms in the ring thereof, an N mono substituted acetacetamide, an N di substituted acetoacetamide, an N mono substituted cyanoacetamide and an N di substituted cyanoacetamide and ii formaldehyde with iii a compound selected from the group consisting of a primary organic gamine, a secondary organic amine, and ammonia under Mannich reaction conditions.

Sometimes such components fulfill more than one of these functions. Acid stabilizers generally employed are well known as are methods of their preparation. Representative of such acid stabilizers are citric acid, tartaric acid, boric acid, mixtures thereof and the like or inorganic acid salts such as zinc sulfate, aluminum sulfate, zinc chloride and the like.

The diazo sensitizing compositions of the invention are a modification of the conventional diazo sensitizing compositions described above, in that the azo coupler ingredient is the reaction mixture obtained upon the reaction of a specific class of azo coupler with formaldehyde and a primary or secondary amine or ammonia under Mannich reaction conditions.

The term halogen is used herein in its conventional sense as embracive of chlorine, bromine, fluorine and iodine and the term halo means chloro, bromo, fluoro and iodo respectively. The term alkoxy is used herein to mean the monovalent moiety of the formula alkyl wherein alkyl is as described above. Illustrative of alkoxy are methoxy, ethoxy, butoxy, pentyloxy, heptyloxy, decyloxy, dodecyloxy and the like. The term acryl includes phenyl and naphthyl. Representative of preferred azo dye couplers employed in the present invention are catechol catechol acetate catechol mono hydroxyethyl ether resorcinol resorcinol acetate resorcinol monohydroxyethyl ether 4 chlororesorcinol 2 methyl resorcinol 2,4 dichlororesorcinol 2,4 dihydroxy benzoic acid amide 2,4 dihydroxy benzoic acid ethanolamide 3,5 dihydroxy benzoic acid 3,5 dihydroxy benzoic acid ethanolamide 3, 5 dihydroxy toluene 2,6 dihydroxy toluene 4 bromo 3,5 dihydroxy benzoic acid 4 bromo 3,5 dihydroxy benzoic acid amide 2,4 3 trihydroxydiphenyl 2 hydroxy naphthalene 3, 6 disulfonic acid 2, 3 dihydroxy naphthalene 2, 3 dihydroxy naphthalene 6 sulEonic acid 2, 7 dihydroxy naphthalene 3 ,6 disulfonic acid cyanoacetamide cyanoacet morpholide cyanoacet benzylamide di cyanoacet triethylene tetramine acetoacet anilide acetoacet benzylamide acetoaceo o methylanilide ethylene bis acetoacetamide l phenyl 3 methyl pyrazolone 5 acetoacet amino aceto acet amide diresorcinol sulfide and the like. The azo dye couplers described above are reacted underMannich reaction conditions according to the invention with preferably equimolar proportions of formaldehyde and at least one of ammonia, a primary organic amine or a secondary amine. Primary and secondary organic amines used in the present invention may be represented by the structural formulae EMI15.1 wherein R1 and R2 each independently may represent hydrogen, lower alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or aralkyl orEMI15.2 wherein R3 represents ethylene and Y represents one of nitrogen, sulfur or oxygen.

The term ethylene11 is used herein to mean the divalent moiety obtained upon removal of two hydrogen atoms from theparent hydrocarbon, ethane. Representative of primary and secondary amines which may be used are methy lamine ethylamine propy lamine propanolamine butylamine benzylamine dimethylamine diethylamine dipropy lamine dibutylamine dipropano lamine dibenzylamine morpholine piperaz ine and the like The above described reaction to obtain the reaction product of the azo dye coupler with the formaldehyde and the amine or ammonia may be carried out over a broad range of temperatures and pressures, neither being critical parameter of the reaction.Advantageously the reaction is carried out at a temperature within the range of from about 10 C. to about 50 C., preferably at room temperature circa 26 C. and under atmospheric pressures. Advantageously, the reaction is carried out in the presence of the anions of one or more of the acids selected from the group consisting of hydrochloric acid, sulfamic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, toluenesulfonic acid, sulfosalicylic acid, methanesulfonic acid, diglycolic acid, maleic acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid and the like at a pH of below 7.0. The reaction is generally complete within minutes and is indicated by a drop in temperature of the reaction mixture. While the mechanisms of the effect from the use of the reaction product described above in diazotype compositions is not fully understood, it appears that the mobility of the couplers in the diazo coating layer is affected without forming a permament link. One would expect that such a link would change the water solubility of the azo dye after coupling but this is not the case. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that since the coupling agent employed in the present invention need not be isolated from the reaction product mixture, there is a saving of materials and an elimination of the disposal of residual by products, etc. It is of course also possible to introduce more than one methylolamine or substituted methylolamine group into couplers containing more than one enolic moiety as each enolic moiety may undergo the Mannich reaction and such multiple substitutions are also part of the invention The diazo compositions of the invention may be prepared by bringing the ingredients together in a suitable vessel.Preferably the diazo compositions of the invention are prepared in an aqueous media for use as an aqueous coating mixture to prepare diazotype reproduction materials of the invention. The coupling agents of the invention can be considered as Mannich bases of polyhydroxy benzenes of polyhydroxy naphthalene disulronates and of acetoacet and cyanoacetamides. While they are much more difficult to isolate as crystalline compounds and thus have hardly ever been explored, we have found that there is no need to isolate them and that they can be used with full efficiency in the form of concentrate solutions and that they may even be formed in situ in the diazo sensitizing solutions The proportions of the various components of the compositions of the invention described above may be those proportions conventionally used in their use prior to this invention, in the preparation of prior art diazo light sensitive compositions where they were so used . These proportions are well known to those skilled in the art see for example the disclosures of Kosar, supra., and of U. S. Patents 3,923,518 and 3,996,056. In general, the aqueous diazo coating compositions contain from about 0.1 to about 10 percent by weight of the light sensitive diazonium compound and sufficient coupler to react with and couple the diazonium compound upon development. Representative of suitable base supports are thermoplastic polymeric resin films, foils including metal foils, cloth, opaque paper, translucent papers and like supports. Preferred are the commercially available diazotype papers. For the preparation of diazo materials such as polymeric films and polymeric resin coated papers bearing diazo compositions, the diazonium and other ingredients are dissolved in polaric organic solvents such as alcohols, ketones or glycol ethers. The diazo composition is then applied from the solvent media to the base support material. The following examples describe the manner and the process of making and using the invention and set forth the best mode contemplated by the inventors for carrying out the invention but are not to be construed as limiting. In reporting the testing of compositions of the invention, an accelerated aging test is referred to. The accelerated aging test is carried out as follows A diazo sensitized reproduction sheet of ii x 17 dimensions is cut into 2 sheets of 8 1 2 x Il size. One sheet is exposed in a closed container, with exclusion of light, to an atmosphere of 75 room humidity R.H. at 50 C. for a period of 24 hours. The other sheet is kept in a black polyethylene envelope. After 24 hours, both sheets are printed in a commercial dlazotype copying machine such as the OZAMATIC SUPER OM manufactured by the Ozalid Corporation, Binghamton, NewYork. The sheets are exposed behind a standard step wedge at a printing speed sufficient to destroy the diazo compound completely behind the light area of the step wedge, to partially destroy the diazo behind the grey intermediate steps of the wedge and insufficient to destroy any diazo compound behind the black maximum density step of the wedge.After exposure the sheets are processed through the development section of the Ozamatic for ammonia development.The loss of maximum print color density of the aged sheet when compared with the non aged sheet can be caused by partial destruction of the diazo compound or by migration of coupling components or both. A noticeable print color shift of full tones and half tones in the aged print when compared with the non aged print indicates migration of coupling components from the coating layer. A strong coloration of the print background on the aged sheet when compared with the non aged sheet is the result of precoupling and indicates the diazotype has very limited shelf life. A print color shift of blackline diazotypes, when aged as described above, indicates that at least one coupling component has migrated from the coating layer. Partial destruction of the diazo and precoupling can be remedied through an increase of the stabilizing agents in the diazo coating layer, without changing components. Print color loss and print color shifting could not be remedied up to now except for eliminating migrating couplers. Unfortunately, it has been difficult and costly to find replacement couplers for equal shades and rates of development. The present invention overcomes such problems and provides the means to reduce the mobility of couplers that tend to migrate, thus making them useful for the diazotype process.Example 1 This is not an example of the invention but is made for comparative purposes. On a 3 airknife station diazotype coating machine for precoating, sensitizing, and backcoating, equipped with high velocity hot air drying passes after each coating, a diazo base paper of 72 gIm2 basis weight is consecutively treated on the felt side with 1 a precoat composition of non colloidal silicas 1 micron particle size 50 g vinyl acetate copolymer 100 ml. antifoaming agent 1 ml. water, enough to make 1000 ml. 2 a sensitizing solution of the following composition citric acid 150 g naphthalene 1 3 6,1 3 7 trisulfonic acid, sodium salt 150 g thiourea 350 g 2, 7 dihydroxynaphthalene 3,6 disulEonic acid, disodium salt blue coupler 160 g 2,4 3 trihydroxydiphenyl brown coupler 40 g isopropyl alcohol 100 mb glycerine 300 ml. 1 diazo 4 dimethylamine benzene, chloride, 1 2 zinc chloride 200 g zinc chloride 300 g blue dye, alizarine irisol 0.5 g water, to complete to 10 liter 3 a backcoating solution for curl control zinc chloride 40 g citric acid S g water, to complete to 1000 ml.The coated and dried diazotype paper is then wound up and cut into sheets. Print tests are made with the paper as it is and after accelerated aging tests as described above. Example 2 The procedure of Example 1, supra., is repeated except for the sensitizing solution 2 composition to which there was added a mixture of 170 ml. diethanolamine 130 ml. formaldehyde 37 65 ml. acetic acid glacial and 40 ml. water One sheet produced in each of the Examples 1 and 2 was aged as described above. The aged sheets and the non aged sheets from both examples were then test printed and developed in an Ozamatic. Both non aged prints from Examples 1 and 2 showed deep black full tones and neutral grey half tones on a white background. The aged sheet from Example 1 developed to brown shades in full and half tones. The print from the aged sheet from Example 2 developed to slightly blueish black shades in full tones and to grey in half tones The brown color shade of the print from the aged sheet from Example 1 indicates that the blue coupler had migrated from the coating layer during the accelerated aging process and that it was not available for coupling when the print was developed.Examples 3 and 4 The procedure of Example 1, supra., was repeated except the composition of coating No. 2 which was varied as follows Example 3 Example 4 citric acid 150 g 150 g thiourea 400 g 400 g 1 diazo 4 dimethylamino benzene chloride, 1 2 zinc chloride 100 g 100 g zinc chloride 400 g 400 g resorcinol 25 gA reaction mixture of resorcinol 25 g in isopropanol 60 ml.diethanolamine 25 ml.formaldehyde 37 20 ml.hydrochloric acid d.l.l9 25 ml.water, complete to 10 liter 10 liter Some sheets from Example 3 and 4 underwent the accelerated aging process described above. After printing and developing non aged and aged sheets, the prints from non aged sheets from Examples 3 and 4 developed to strong brown print colors. The print from the aged sheet from Example 4 developed to nearly the same print line density as the non aged sheets. The aged print of Example 3 lost more than half of its original print line density.Examples 5, 6 and 7 The procedure of Example 1, supra., was repeated except the composition coating No. 2 was varied as follows Example 5 Example 6 Example 7 citric acid 150 g 150 g 150 g thiourea 400 g 400 g 400 g l diazo 4 dimethylamino benzene chloride, 1 2 zinc chloride 100 g 100 g 100 g 4 chlororesorcinol 35 g 35 g 35 g a reaction mixture of isopropyl alcohol 60 ml.diethylamine 19 ml.N methyl ethanolamine 19 ml.formaldehyde 37 20 ml.hydrochloric acid d. 1.19 25 ml. 25 ml.zinc chloride 400 g 400 g gOO g water, complete to 10 liter 10 liter 10 liter Some sheets from Examples 5, 6 and 7 underwent the accelerated aging process described in Example 2.

The prints from the aged sheets from Examples 6 and 7 produced brown print colors of similar strength as the non aged prints. The aged print ofExample 5 lost more than half of its original print line density.Examples B, 9 and 10 The procedure of Example 1, supra., was repeated except for the composition of coating No. 2 which was varied as follows Example 8 Example 9 Example 10 citric acid 125 g 125 g 125 g thiourea 400 g 400 g 400 g caffeine 140 g 150 g 150 g beta hydroxy naphthoic acid diethanolamide blue coupler 110 g 110 g 110 g cyanoacetmorpholide yellow coupler 100 g 100 g 100 g l diazo 2,5 diethoxy 4 morpholino benzene chloride, 1 2 zinc chloride 150 g 150 g 150 g dipropylene glycol 150 ml. 150 ml. 150 ml.isopropyl alcohol 100 ml. 100 ml. 100 ml.

When sheets from Examples 8, 9 and 10 underwent accelerated aging as described above, and printing and development was carried out in the same Ozamatic diaso copier, only the print from Example 10 developed to the same black and neutral grey shades as the non aged sheets. The print from Example 8 developed to print colors with a pronounced blueish cast in full tones and intermediate tones and the print from Example 9 produced somewhat blueish hues that were approximately half way between the print colors ofExamples 8 and 10. The accelerated aging migration of the yellow coupler cyanoacet morpholide in Example 8 and, to a lesser degree inExample 9, has been completely inhibited in Example 10.Examples 11, 12 and 13 The procedure of Example 1, supra., was repeated except the 72 gIm2 diazo base paper was replaced by a resin transparentized 100 rag base paper of 60 g m2 basis weight and the composition of coating No. 2 was varied as follows Example 11 Example 12 Example 13 citric acid 200 g 200 g 20Q g thiourea 300 g 300 g 300 g 1 diazo 4 diethyl amino benzene, chloride, 1 2 zinc chloride 300 g 300 g 300 g resorcinol 60 g 60 g 60 g isopropyl alcohol 100 ml. 100 ml. 100 ml.ammonium chloride 30 g methane sulfonic acid 1Q g 55 y monoethanolamine 33 g formaldehyde 378 45 ml. 45 ml.diethylene glycol 200 ml. 200 ml. 200 ml.zinc chloride 200 g 200 g 200 y saponin 3 5 3 g 3 g water, complete to 10 liter 10 liter 10 liter One sheet from each of the Example 11, 12 and 13 was aged as described above.

When used as a second original to make diazo copies, poor quality reprints with weak lines were obtained. The aged prints from Examples 12 and 13 developed to brown print dyes of almost the same density as the non aged sheets from the same examples. When used as second originals to make diazo copies, high quality diazo copies with strong print lines were obtained.Examples 14 and 15 A polyester film, 75 micron thick, which has been surface treated for promotion adhesion was precoated with a cellulose acetate butyrate lacquer and subsequently sensitized with the following compositions. Example 14 Example 15 isopropylalcohol 5 1. 4.25 1. methyl ethyl ketone 3 1. 3 1. ethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2 1. 2 1.sulfosalicylic acid 100 g. 100 g. thiourea 200 g. 200 g. 1 diazo 2.5 dibutoxy 4 morpholino benzene borofluoride 250 g. 250 g.resorcinol 150 g.A reaction mixture of resorcinol 150 g.in isopropanol 360 ml ammonia 115 ml formaldehyde 37t 100 ml acetic acid glacial 150 m. Some sheets of Examples 14 and 15 underwent the accelerated aging process described in Example 2, supraAfter printing and developing of the aged and non aged sheets, the print of Example 15 showed a higher density of brown dye and a higher actinic opacity than the prints ofExample 14 after aging, whereas no difference was apparent on the non aged sheets. When a second original used to make diazo copies, the aged prints of Example 14 gave good quality reprints and those of Example 15 gave poor quality reprints.
