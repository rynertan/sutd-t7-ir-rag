# Load cell.

## Abstract
A load cell has four strain gauge resistors 18 1 to 18 4 formed through an insulation layer 4 on the beam body 2 having a strain generating section, a conductive pattern 12 for forming a bridge circuit by coupling the strain gauge resis tors 18 1 to 18 4 , compensation resistance sections 14,16 1, 16 2, 20 1, 20 2 for compensating the bridge balance and span of the bridge circuit is provided. A section of the conduc tive pattern except the section coupled to the strain gauge resistors 18 1 to 18 4 is disposed at a position sufficiently isolated from the strain gauge resistors 18 1 to 18 4 .
