# Method and apparatus for firing ceramic products.

## Abstract
Clay pipes and the like 3 are fired in a kiln 1 through which they are conveyed by a pusher conveyer 2,4 as individual articles, instead of being carried on cars or in containers. In the main firing zone of the kiln the pipes 3 roll along a surface 6 to maintain roundness and ensure uniform heating. In the preheating zone of the kiln the pipes are carried by carriers 5 of the conveyer without rotating. The pipes may also be carried without rotating in the final cooling zone of the kiln.
