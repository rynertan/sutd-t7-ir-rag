# APPARATUS FOR CONVEYING A SEMICONDUCTOR WAFER

## Abstract
A transfer apparatus 14 for conveying a semiconduc tor wafer 90 between a first location 42 at a first pressure and a second location 12 at a second pressure comprises a substantially airtight transfer chamber 26 having clos able ports 38, 40 and transfer arm means 84 including first and second elongated arm members 86, 88 each having first and second ends. The first end of the first arm member 86 is pivotally supported at a point generally midway between the two locations 12, 14 and the first end of the second arm member 88 is pivotally supported by the first arm member 86 proximate to the second end thereof. The first and second arm members 86,88 are of sufficient length and are cooperative to pivot to at least a first position in which at least a part of the second arm member 88 extends to the first location 42 , a second position in which at least a part of the second arm member 88 extends to the second location 12 and an intermediate position. Arm member actuator means 96 are provided for pivoting the first and second arm members 86, 88 to the first, second and intermediate positions.
