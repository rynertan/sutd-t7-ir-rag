# Revised spline drive for metal belt CVT.

## Abstract
A variable pulley transmission in which each pulley is con structed of a pair of flanges coupied to respective shafts, at least one flange of each pair being axially movable relative to the other flange of the same pair, the movable flange 36 be ing coupled to its shaft by an external spline 42 operative as sociated with the flange meshing with an internal spline 46 on a drive member 44 coupled to the shaft 32 . The spline con nection permits the flange to move axially while maintaining the drive coupling.
