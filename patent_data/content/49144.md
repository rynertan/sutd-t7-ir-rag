## Description
5 Fluoro Uracil Derivatives NOVEL COMPOUNDS This invention relates to certain new substituted uracils which have anti tumour activity. It is known to react trimethylsilylated uracil derivatives with acetals in the presence of Lewis acids, such as SnC14, to give l l methoxyalkyl uracils see for example U. Niedballa and H. Vorbruggen J. Org. Chem., 41, 2084 1976 and 39, 3672 1974 Japanese PatentNos. 1,113,882 3023986, 3023987 2059171 2059172 2083386 2128384 4038344 . We have now discovered a class of novel 5 fluoro substituted uracils which possess anti tumour activity at doses well below those at which they are toxic for mammals. These novel substituted uracils are also useful as intermediates in the preparation of other anti tumour agents. According to the present invention there is provided a compound of formula. I EMI2.1 in which R1 is hydrogen or C1 6 alkanoyl, R2 is C1 6 alkyl, and Z is hydrogen or OR Preferably, R2 is methyl and R1 is acetyl or hydrogen. Suitably, when Z is hydrogen or hydroxyl, R1 is hydrogen. The compounds of formula I in which R1 is C1 6 alkanoyl may be prepared by reacting a trialkylsilylated uracil derivative of formula II EMI2.2 in which Rx is a C1 4 alkyl group, preferably methyl, with a compound of formula III EMI2.3 in which R1 is C alkanoyl,Z and R2 are as defined in formula I and R is C16 alkyl or C1 6 alkanolyl in the presence of a Lewis acid, preferably SnCl4. The reaction is suitably carried out in the presence of anhydrous acetonitrile under an atomsphere of dry nitrogen. Preferably, R3 is C16 alkanoyl suitably acetylA preferred group for R2 is methyl. Compounds of formula III wherein R3 is C16 alkanoyl are novel intermediates and form a further aspect of the present invention. Compounds of formula I in which R1 is hydrogen andZ is hydroxyl may be prepared by hydrolysing the compounds of formula I in which R1 is C1 6 alkanoyl and Z is OR1 preferably using a mixture of methanol and ammonia. In a similar manner, compounds of formula I in which R1 andZ are both hydrogen may be prepared by hydrolysing compounds of formula I in which R1 is C1 6 alkanoyl and Z is hydrogen. The crude reaction products may be purified by short path column chromatography. The compounds of formula II may themselves be prepared by treating 5 fluoro uracil of formula IV EMI3.1 with hexamethyldisilazane and or a trialkylhalo silane, preferably trimethylchlorosilane. The reaction is suitably carried out in an organic solvent, preferably pyridine. Compounds of formula III in which R1 and R3 are each C16 alkanoyl may be prepared by a treating a compound of formula V EMI4.1 wherein A is a halogen atom, preferably chlorine, and R2 is as defined in formula I , with a salt of a C16 alkanoic acid, or, b treating a compound of formula VI EMI4.2 wherein R2 is as defined in formula I , with a C1 6 alkanoic acid anhydride. Process a is suitably carried out in the presence of dry acetonitrile and a solubilising agent, such as 18 crown 6, for the alkanoic acid salt. Process b is suitably carried out in the absence of a solvent or diluent, preferably in the presence of a catalytic amount of a mineral acid such as sulphuric acid. The compounds of formula I have two asymmetric carbon atoms, marked with asterisks in the following formula EMI5.1 The compounds therefore exist in four stereoisomeric forms, and the present invention encompasses all stereoisomers alone or admixed with other stereoisomers in any proportion. Ion a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of the formula I together with a, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Compositions which may be given by the oral route may be compounded in the form of syrups, tablets and capsules. When the composition is in the form of a tablet, any pharmaceutical carrier suitable for formulating such solid compositions may be used, for example magnesium stearate, starch, lactose, glucose, rice, flour and chalk.The composition may also be in the form of an ingestible capsule, for example of gelatin, to contain the compound, or in the form of a syrup, a solution or a suspension.Suitable liquid pharmaceutical carriers include ethyl alcohol, glycerine, saline and water to which flavouring or colouring agents may be added to form syrups. The compounds may also be presented with a sterile liquid carrier for injection, Preferably the compositions,pf this invention are in unit dosage form or in some other form that the patient may administer to himself a single dose A suitable dosage unit might contain from 50 mg to 1 g of active ingredient. For example 100 to 500 mg. Such doses may be administered I to 4 times a day or more usually 2 or 3 times a day. The effective dose of compound depends on the particular compound employed, but is in general in the range of from 1.0 mg kg day to 20 mg kg of body weight per day or more usually 2.0 mg kg day to 10 mg kg day. Accordingly in a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a method of treating tumours in human or non human animals which comprises administering to the animal an effective amount of a compound of formula I .
