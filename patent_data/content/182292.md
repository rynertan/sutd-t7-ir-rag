# Compressor refrigerating machine with vapor liquid separator.

## Abstract
Disclosed is a compact compressor refrigerating ma chine, particularly a turbo refrigerating machine which uses a turbocompressor, having a motor 1 , a set up gear 7 , a com pressor 2 , a condenser 3 , a pressure reducing means 4 , and an evaporator 5 . A vapor liquid separator 6 having a first opening 6C on the bottom wall 68 thereof and second 6E and third 6F openings on the side wall 6D thereof is in stalled on the evaporator 5 in such a manner that the vapor liquid separator 6 communicates with the evaporator 5 through the first opening 6C . The compressor 2 is con nected to the side wall 6D of the vapor liquid separator 6 so as to communicate the second opening 6E with the suction passage 2C of the compressor 2 and the third opening 6F with the discharge passage 2D of the compressor 2 , re spectively. A separation element 6A is disposed in the vapor liquid separator 6 so as to cross the flow of the refrigerant va por which flows from the first opening 6C toward the second opening 6E .
