# GAS PHASE GRAFT POLYMERIZATION METHOD

## Abstract
In a gas phase graft polymerization method wherein at least one radical polymerizable monomer is graft polymerized onto a polymer by feeding the monomer in the gaseous state onto the polymer while maintaining the polymer substantially in the solid state, an improvement wherein a radical polymeriza tion initiator is fed in the gaseous state onto the polymer. Ac cording to the process, the polymer is impregnated with the in itiator in the dry state without using a solvent, which results in achievement of a high graft modification efficiency at low cost without troublesome procedures.
