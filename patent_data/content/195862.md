# Arc chute for a circuit breaker.

## Abstract
An arc chute for a circuit breaker comprises a plurality of spaced apart arc plates 1 which are to be disposed in proximity to arc contacts 8a, 9a and which guide the hot gas caused by arcs generated by the opening of the circuit breaker contacts, a pair of side members 2 for retaining the arc plates, and deflector projections 6 disposed on the inner sides of the side members to which the arc plates are attached. Each projection 6 is spaced from the ends of the arc plates on the contact side, and projects towards the opposing side member such that the gas flow is not directed to the inner sides of the side members.
