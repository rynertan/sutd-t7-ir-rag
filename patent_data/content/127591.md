# Guide device for sliding glasses of motor vehicles and method for manufacturing same.

## Abstract
The device includes a channel shaped weather strip 11 fixed to the body of the motor vehicle along one side of the window and provided with a rigid core 18 and a pair of converging lips 15, 16 which cooperate with the opposite surfaces of the glass C . A runner 23 fixed to the edge of the glass cooperates slidingly with the rigid core 18 of the weather strip 11 . The rigid core 18 is at least partially embedded in the body of the weather strip 11 and has first 19 and second 20 limbs extending respectively in corres pondence with the base wall 12 of the weather strip 11 and that side wall 14 of the weather strip 11 facing inwardly of the motor vehicle. The second limb 20 also has a bent appendage 21 the end of which lies approximately in the median longitudinal plane of the weather strip 11 . The zone of convergence of the lips 15, 16 of the weather strip 11 , however, lies in an intermediate plane between this longitud inal median plane and the side wall 13 of the weather strip 11 facing outwardly of the motor vehicle. The runner 23 is L shaped with one arm 25 connected to the glass and the other arm 26 in sliding contact with that surface 22 of the profiled appendage 21 of the second limb 20 of the core 18 of the weather strip 11 facing the first limb 19 of the core 18 . The arrangement is such that the arm 24 of the runner 23 connected to glass C cooperates slidingly with the side wall 14 of the weather strip 11 facing outwardly of the vehicle.
