# Liquid fuel processing apparatus.

## Abstract
Apparatus is disclosed for use in connection with a fuel storage tank for the processing of fuel components con tained in the said tank to develop a homogenous and stable alternate liquid fuel mixture which apparatus is character ised by the combination in series for fluid transmission bet ween an outlet port of the said tank and an inlet port of the said tank of a fuel filter 14 , a pump 38 driven by a power source 30 , and a static mixer 48,50 . In preferred forms of the invention a heater 20 is 40 arranged in series with the filter pump and static mixer.
