# MAGNETIC RECORDING AND REPRODUCING APPARATUS

## Abstract
A magnetic recording and reproducing apparatus in which audio PCM encoded data is recorded and reproduced in areas in which video data is usually recorded using a head drum rotational speed and tape feeding speed different from those used for ordinary video or audio signal recording. Accordingly, because the recording area for the audio signals is effectively increased, the number of quantization bits of the audio signal can be increased without reducing the number of channels of audio signals recorded or the sampling frequency, thus providing an improved dynamic range and reproduced sound quantity.
