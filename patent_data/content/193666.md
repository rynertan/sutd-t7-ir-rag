The water recovered in the recovery tank 62 is returned to the cooling tank 45 through a hose 68. In the fuel manufacturing equipment of the above construction, the soft waste 3 and the hard waste 3A are received by the operation of the soft waste feeder 2 and the hard waste feeder 9. At this time, although the soft waste 3 and the hard waste 3A are transferred by the blowers 6 and 14, the air sent to the receiving tank 1 is led to the intakes 7 and 16 of the blowers 6 and 14 by the air ducts 8 and 8A. Therefore, it has neither leakage of the harmful substance to the outside nor air pollution of the circumstances. On the other hand, the additive 18 received in the additive tank 49 is transferred to the additive receiving tank 17 by the operation of the transfer equipment 58 and received in the additive receiving tank 17. Then, the heating chamber 21 is heated up by the combustion at the combustion furnace 28. The No.1 transfer equipment 25, the No. 2 transfer equipment 26 and the No.3 transfer equipment 27 are driven. The fixed quantities of the soft waste 3 and the hard waste 3A from the receiving tank 1 and the additive 18 from the additive receiving tank 17 are thrown by falling onto the guide plate 30 of the No. 1 transfer equipment 25 in order at the fixed rate. The soft waste 3, the hard waste 3A and the additive 18 thrown by falling onto the guide plate 30 are transferred to the other place in order. And also the soft waste 3, the hard waste 3A and the additive 18 are mixed. Durins the transfer of the No.1 transfer equipment 25 the mixture is dried up by heating at 150n 200C in about 15 minutes.The mixture is transferred by the No. 1 transfer equipment 25 with drying and also transferred to the other place in order by the screw 34 heating at 200n 250C in about 10 minutes after the throwing by falling onto the guide plate 33 of the No. 2 transfer equipment 26. The mixture is transferred by the No. 2 transfer equipment 26 with heating and also transferred to the other place in order by the screw 37 melting by heating at 250n 380C in about 7 minutes after the throwing by falling onto the guide plate 36 of the No.3 transfer equipment 27 and then discharged to the mixer 43. A harmful gas generated when the mixture is transferred by the No. 1 transfer equipment 25, the No. 2 transfer equipment 26 and the No.3 transfer equipment 27 is recovered by the gas recovery equipment 61. The recovered gas is led to the combustion burner to be burned and the water used for desulfurization is returned to the cooling tank 45 through the hose 68. The exhaust gas discharged from the chimney 29 is cleaned by the scrubbers 41,41 to which the water of pH 810 is supplied by the water supply equipment 55 for the purpose of removing soot and smoke and desulfurization and made to separate the mist by the mist separator 42. So it is possible to make the state of non environmental pollution perfectly.The water used by the scrubbers 41, 41 is led to the mixer 43 through the exhaust pipe 40 and then returned to the cooling tank 45. The melt 44 led to the mixer 43 is shredded to granulated substance by the mixer 43 and thrown into the cooling tank 45 receiving the cooling water 47 of pH 8 10 to be cooled. By the granulated substance 46 thrown into the cooling tank 45, the pH of the cooling water in the cooling tank 45 changes to 5 6. After the granulated substance 46 has been cooled in the cooling tank 45, the granulated substance fuel 46 with the cooling water is transferred to the product storage 50 by the transfer equipment 52. At the product storage 50, the granulated substance fuel 46 is piled up and the cooling water is led to the additive tank 49 through the water shoot 51.The cooling waterPH of which is changed from 5 6 to 8 10 in the additive tank 49 is led to the cooling water receiving tank 48 and the cooling tank 45. In the fuel manufacturing equipment of the above construction, it is economical because all water used in the above fuel manufacturing equipment is recovered to the cooling tank 45, the cooling water receiving tank 48 and the additive tank 49 and also it does not cause harm to the public because the cooling water polluted is not discharged from the system. And also the harmful gas has never been discharged from the system because the harmful gas generated at the melting equipment is desulfurized at the gas recovery equipment 61 and then led to the combust ion burner 66 and burned As wi I I be apparent from the aforesaid explanations, the invention has many effects as listed below. 1 As it has a melting equipment for heating and melting waste refuse made by removing noncombustible matter such as metal. etc. from industrial waste such as shredder dust, etc. domestic waste, raw refuse, etc. under the condition of adding an additive acting as a solidifying agent, a supporter of combustion and a counteractive and removing harmful substance by gasification from it, it has never generated harmful gas from the melt which is melted by heating in case of being burned. 2 As it comprises a melting equipment, a cooling tank and a transfer equipment, it makes the equipment so simple and it is possible to install the equipment at the low cost. 3 As it is enough only to add the additive such as asphalt, etc. to the waste refuse containing synthetic resin material, vinyl, etc.. it is possible to cut down remarkably the cost of manufacturing fuel. In other words, it is possible to manufacture low priced fuel having a high calorific value. 4 Referring to item 3 , it is possible to manufacture fuel at the cost similar to the cost of the waste treating heretofore in use. So it is possible to use the waste refuse as the effective resources and it is economical. 5 It is economical, as the cooling water is re used by circulation. 6 Referring to it em 5 . it is not necessary to worry about the environmental pollution, as the cooling water polluted is not discharged from the system.
