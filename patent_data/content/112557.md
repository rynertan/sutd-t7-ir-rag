# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING A POLYURETHANE ELASTOMER BY REACTION INJECTION MOLDING

## Abstract
A process for producing a shaped article of a non cellular or microcellular polyurethane elastomer by reaction injection molding by using at least two components of A a polyol com ponent comprising a high molecular weight polyol and a chain extender as essential ingredient and B an isocyanate com ponent comprising a polyisocyanate compound as essential ingriedent, characterized in that substantially all or at least 80 by weight of said high molecular weght polyol is composed of a polyoxyalkylene polyol, and the polyoxyalkylene polyol is a single or mixed polyoxyalkylene polyol which has an average hydroxyl number of from 2.0 to 3.5 and an average hydroxyl value of from 15 to 60 and contains at least 5 by weight, in an average of oxyethylene groups at the terminal portions of the oxyalkylene chain and in which the total oxyethylene group content, in an average, less than 21 by weight and the aver age unsaturated monool content is at most 0.085 meq g.
