# Method for updating in a wheeled vehicle steered by dead reckoning.

## Abstract
In a wheeled vehicle steered by dead reckoning, which calculates its own position on the basis of distances deter mined by rolling off measurement, the error in position determination will increase gradually and necessitate updat ing. According to the invention, the floor is provided with markings A,B which are observed by a linear detector mounted transversely in the vehicle, and linear images 30, 31 are obtained. At least two different measurements are carried out of the position of a marking A in relation to the vehicle, and the distance travelled by the vehicle between the measurements is measured. From these three measured distances, the angle between the vehicle and the marking can be determined. An additional marking B forming an angle with the first marking A makes it possible to determine the position in the direction of movement of the vehicle as well.
