# Instrumented test hammer.

## Abstract
An instrumented test hammer for use in vibrationally exciting a test object includes a head assembly having an impact tip and a transducer operatively arranged to sense the force of an impact between the tip and object and to convert such sensed force into a proportional electrical signal, a handle extending away from the head assembly, and a cushioned grip surrounding a portion of the handle at a loca tion spaced from the head assembly. The hammer is tuned , by proper selection of the grip material and by selection of the ratio of the total mass of the head assembly to the combined mass of the handle and grip, such that the node of the first translational resonant mode of the hammer, after impacting against an object, is located substantially proximate the head assembly, independently of the manner by which the grip is held. The improved hammer substantially avoids the genera tion of spurious electrical signals due to post impact vibration of the head assembly.
