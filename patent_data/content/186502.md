## Description
FLAVOR CAPSULE AND METHOD OF PREPARING SAME FIELD OF THE The present invention relates to controlled release flavour capsules, particularly to capsules intended for chewing and csr sucking, thereby extracting flavours and or juices contained therrein.Most particularly, the invention is concenrned with tobacco capsules which release tobacco flavours and or juices in a controlled manner and are thus helpful in enabling parsons to stop smoking or at least to reduce their desire and need to smoke as well as continue to anjoy tobacco. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Smoking cigarettes presents a serious health hazard. Thie is due, in great measure, to the burning of tobacco which generates tars, carbon monoxide and other undesirable products which enter the lungs during smoking. The intake of tobacco juice, particularly nicotine, does, however, give pleasure to the sko and it would be desirable to be able to provide inns for delivering to the mouth the tobacco juices hut not the undesirable combustion products of smoking. To this and several solution have been proposed. Amoung theseU. S. Patent No. 3,877, 468 discloses a chewing gum containing tobacco alkaloid. U. S. Patent No. 3,757,798 describes a pouch made of tenbag paper filled with tobacco, This pouch is to b. placed in the mouth so tbat saliva mixes with the tobacco inside the pooch dissolving same of the juice and then passes back through the pouch into the mouth, This pouch, which is made of paper is not readily chemable since it is likely to be perforated when bitten and release some tobacco, therefore restricting the user to gentle sucking action onyl. Food capsules are also known. Thuc U.S. Patent No. 3, 620, 759 describes perforated gelatine capsules containing soluble food extracts which are extracted in contact with water and are subsequently dissolved together with the capsule. The capsules were not suggested for use in the mouth, SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION we have discovered that it is possible to provide a flavour capsule which will dispense flavours and or juices such as, for example, tobacco flavour and or juices, slowly and in a controlled manner by chewing and sucking.It is therafore the objective of this invention to provide a flavour capsule for controllably releasing liquid extractable flavours and or juices contained therein by the application of pressure on the walls of the capsule, Another objective is to provide a method for manufactuting such flavour capsules. Yet another objective is to provide enjoyment of tobecco as well as a method to reduce dependency on cigarettes by substitutung hte chewing and or sucking of capsules containing tobacco for actual smoking. There is thus provided in accordance with the present invention a controlled release flavor capsule including a thin walled capsule made of non rubbery, resilient, water insoluble, non toxic plastic, and filling material containing extractable flavours and or juices enclosed in the capsule, the capsule difining one or more small slits which open when pressure is applied to the capsule, the capsule being of suitable dimensions to be completely concealable inside the mouth. According to one embodiment of the inventions, the flavor capsule has a cylindrical shape and dimensions of about 10 to 25 mm long and 5 to 25 mm in diameter. According to an alternate embodiment, the flavor capsule has the shape of a round disc and is 10 to 30 mm in diameter and about 5 to 15 mm in hei. There is further provived in accordance with the pressent invention a process for manufacturing flavor capsules including filling hollow cartridges or tube sections of non rubbery resilient, water insoluble, non toxic plastic with a filling material including extractable flavours and or juices, mealing the cartridges or tube reactions and providing at least one alit extending at least substantially through a wall of the cartridge or ttte. According to a preferred embediment, the filling material comprises moist tobecco souff. Further according to a preferred embodiment, the stop of filling incudes inserting a filing sleeves into the open end of the cartridge, introducing moist fibrous filling material through the filling aleeve into the cartrige, removing the filling alesve, compacting the filling material inside the cartrige to a level balow the cartridge height, and sealing the cartidge above the level Or tbe filling material Apparatus far filling flavour capsules according to the present invention is also provided, ERIN DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The present invention will be further understood and appreciated fran the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings in which Figs. la and Ib show one eeodient of a cylindrical capsule constructed and operative in accordance with the present invention Figs. 2a and 2b represent armther embodiment of a cylindrical capsule Figs. 3a and 3b show yet another type of cylindrical capsule Figs. 4a and 4b represent a capsule in the farm of a disc shaped tablet Fig. 5 illustrates an embodiment of apparatus for producing capsules according to the present invention and Figs. 6a and 6b illustrate detail views on the filling device of the apparatus of Fig. 5. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION With reference to Fig. 1a, there is shown a side view of a cylindrical capsule 1 comprising matching body 2 and 3 sealed together at their overlapping point 4 and 5. Each body part has a slit 6,7 through its wall section. Fig, Ib is a cross section of Fig. 1 a taken at 8 8 showing a frontal view of the capsule with the slit 6 at its end. This shaped capsule could also compris a cylindrioaI cap and a matching telescopically engaged body part similar in shape to the wall known glycerine capsules used for holding pharmaceutical preparations. Fig. 2a shows a top view of a capsule comprising a tube section sealed at both ends y and 10. Slit 11 a second slit preferably exists on the botton side enables the contents to be extracted upon appiying pressure to the capsule as, for instance, by chewing and sucking the capsule. Fig. 2b shows a frontal view of this capsule taken acmss 12 12 having slits 11 and 13. The ends 9, 10 of the tube are sealed. Fig. 3a is a top view of a plastic cylindrical cap 14 sealed at one end 15 and having oray one slit 16. Fig. 3b shows this cap fran a frontal view across 17 17. Flg. 4a s a top view of a disc ahaped capsule with a sealed plastic edge around its circumference 18 and slit 19. A second slit not shown is on the underside thereof. Fig.4b is a side view of this same capsule shown across 20 20. The dimensions of the capsules are preferably abut 10 25 mm in length and about 5 25 nrn in diameter far cylindrical shapes, and about 10 30 nrn in diameter and 5 15 me high for disc shapes. The wall thickness of the capsules should range somewhere between 0.3 mm and 1.0 mn and preferably between 0.4 mn to 0.8 mn. It is a particular feature of the present invention that the capsules are of such a size that they are competely conceslable within the mouth of the user. The slits may be essentially round or alongate. According to a preferrd embodiment, the length of the slits is equal to or larger than the capsule wall thickness. The size and shaps of the slit need only be sufficient to allow passage of fluid through them when the capsules physical shape is temporarily deformed by pressing, chewing or squeezingt hut not allowing passage of the filling material, i.e., finely chopped tcbcco, through the slits. It will be appreciated that each of the slits in the capsules of the present invention may comprise an aperture penetrating the entire wall of the capsule, as shown in Fig, la. Alternatively, the slits may ex onIy substantially through the capsule wall, leaving a thin outer convering which is punctured upon application of pressure to the capsule, as illustrated in Figs. 3a and 3b. This latter embodiment of the slits permits the provision of an unbroken exterior capsule surface until the capsule is in use, thus preventing undesired drying, leakage or ingress of matter to the capsule.Furthemore, as stated above, the silts may be of any desired shape to permit selectable cpening upon application of pressure to the capsule. The capsules described above may be filled with flavour and or juice containing material, sealed, and then slit. Alternatively, pre slit plastic sleeves or tubes can be filled with flavour and or juice containing material and sealed afterwards. Suitable flavour ar juice containing material includes foods such as coffee, tes and spices zweets, mouthwashes or breath fresheners, or stimulants, among other things. The flavour capsules of this invention have a particular utility as capsules for enclosing tobacco. particularly moist snuff, and other fibrous, shredded materials, which may be moist or dry. The capsules acoording to the present invention preferably are made of rigid, resilient, water insoluble, non toxic plastic, having sufficient resilience to withstand chewing without being perforated by the teeth. It is important that the capsule should not crack nor break and only the slit should enable the entry and exit of flavour with the help of mouth fluids sucih as saliva. The capsules should also have sane springiness in order to give the person who is chewing the feeling that he is not merely biting a flat plastic disc. Suitable plastics for this purpose are polyolefins, preferably polyethylene and polypropylene and co polymers of these. Fluorocarbons, PVC, ionomers, nylons, polyester and other tharmoplastic resins can also be used as long as they are safe for use in the mouth as approved by the proper health authorities. Satisfaction by the user is achieved by placing the capsule entirely in the mouth and extracting the flavour and juioe from the capsule by dewing between the teeth, pressing between tongue and palate or between the outer gums and lips or between lips and teeth, combined with sucking action. The extracted flavour and or juice is diluted with small amounts of saliva and absorbed by the mouth tissues and digestive system. Since the plastic capsule is resilient, it returns to its approximate original shape after defcxrmation by chewing or squeezing. This elastic action creates a relative vacuum inside the capsule which draws in fresh saliva from the mouth. Cte use for which the capsules of the present invention are particularly suited is for tobacco capsules. In these capsules, the original moisture of the tooaooO is gradually extracted, fresh saliva enters through the slits into the capsule and dissolves more moisture and tobacco juice until all solubles are completaly extracted from the tobacco. The rate of juice extraction is controlled by the force of the squeezing sucking action and by the frequency thereof. The contents of one capsule containing about 0.5 to 1.0 gram of tobacco can be extacted by the average user within 25 minutes. RTI ID 5.33 Fresh capsules, naturally, require only very gentle squeezing to extract the desirable amount of juice. To maintain a constant rate of satisfaction, and particularly as the flavour contant of the capsule nears depletion, chewing will become more vigorous. The tobacco capsules of this invention, when substituted for cigarettes, have a number of advantages. Firstly, they satisfy a need of the smoker for nicotins while at the same time avoiding tar deposits in the lungs and inhalation of carbon monoxide. Morecever, they eliminate throat and hrochial irritation, avoid staining of teeth by smoke, and are acceptable socially. Furthaxmore, the chewing and sucking action of the capsule satisfies the need of an individual to occupy his mouth. Referring now to Fig. 5 there is shown one embodiment of apparatus for producing flavour capsules according to the present invention. The apparatus comprises a rotating frame 30 coupied for rotation to a motor not shown and comprising a plurality of work stations, at each of which a different operation is performed. Affixed beneath rotating frame 30 is a stationary plate 31. The distance between plate 31 and frame 30 around the periphery of frame 30 differs at various location. therealong, , as will be fur explained hereinbelow. The first work station 32 is coupled to a capsule feeding means 34 which may comprise a vibrating feeder. Capsule feeding means 34 provides a if u flow of empty capsules 36 to frame 30. hrh of capsules 36 preferably comprises a preformed cartridge, sealed at one end thereof, prefarably pre slit, difining an upper outwerdly extending flaw 38. Capsule 35 depends from flange 38 in each of the work stations about rotating frame 30. After one capsule 36 has entered work station 32, the frams rotates through sufficient arc to advance each capsule from one station to the next. The . . capsule now reaches second work station 40 where sensor means not shown , such as an electronic seneor, checks to insure that a capsule is, indeed, present. The capsule is then sterilized and the air inside r ed by a flash of nitrogen gas, as known in the art. At the next wert station 42, the capsule is filled. The filling material is provided in a container 44 including a rotary screw or auger type feeder 46. Feeder 46 serves both to measure the desired dose or amount of material for each capsule and to carry it from container 44 to the filling apparatus generally designated 48. Filling apparatus 48 is shown in cut away detail in Figs. 6a and 6b. Capsule 36 naves into work station 42 and a filling sleeve 50 slideably mounted within filling apparatus 45 slides into the capsule as the filling apparatus moves adjacent the open top of the capsule. It is a particular feature of this embodument of the invention that the filling sleeve SO extends from within filling apparatus 48 to within capsule 36. This serves twD purposes, first, to prevent leakage of moisture so the flange or upper portion of the capsule, arx3 second, to permit the introduction of loose filling material to an initial height greater than that of the capsule. Sleeve 51 of screw feeder 46 is moved towards filling sleeve 50 and through an aperture 52 in the side thereof. A predetermined amount of material is introduced by feeder 46 through filling sleeve 50 into capsule 3Q. A slight vibratory movement may be generated in the feeder 46 to spill any loose material from the end of the feeder sleeve 51 into the capsule. Sleeve 51 is then retracted from aperture 52. In the case where the filling material comprises tabacco or other fibrous material, it is desired to compress the material into the capsule. Accordingly, a piston or other means 54 reciprocatably mounted within filling aFparatus 48 is extended through filling sleeve 50 oompr essing the material within capsule 36 to a height balow the flange 38. Piston 54 then retracts, filling sleeve 50 is removed from capsule 36, and the frame rotates the filled capsule to the next work station 56. Between wocl station 42 and work station 56, plate 31 defines an incline whereby the distance between plate 31 and frame 30 grows gradually smaller. As capsule 36 rotates towards work station 56, its bottom engages the i lieed portion of plate 31 and the capsule is gridully raised within the slot in which is rests in frams 30. At work station 56, the top edges of the capsule are sealed to one another, preferably under a nitrogen flash, by any suitable means, such as ultrasonic mealing, and the upper flange is removed from the capsule by any known cutting means, such as opposing blades.The sealed and cut capsule then moves to work station 60 where it is flamed ty a tourch 62 to smoothen any sharp edges. The mealed capsule now progresses to the final station 64, where it is discharged fran frame 30 by any suitable means. It will be appreciated by those akilled in the art that additional work stations may be added as desired to frame 30 in order to carry out additional operations on the capsule. For example, if one is filling capsules with a dry material to which one wishes to add moisture, an additional work station including means for introducing moisture into the filling material within the filled capsule may be provided. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to what has been described bereinabove by way of example. Rather, the scope of the invention is limited solely by the claims which follow.
