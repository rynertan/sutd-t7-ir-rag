# RESIDUE NUMBER SYSTEM UNIVERSAL DIGITAL FILTER

## Abstract
A residue number system RNS universal digital filter 20 is disclosed. The filter system includes an A D converter 22 for digitizing the analog input signals into binary coded signals, a decomposition means 24 for converting the binary coded signals into an RNS format, a filter 26 for filtering the input signal in the RNS format, a recomposition means 30 for con verting the output from the RNS format back to a binary format and a D A converter 32 for converting the binary coded out put signal to an analog signal.
