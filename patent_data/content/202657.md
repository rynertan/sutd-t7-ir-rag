## Description
The present invention relates to a wash cup for use in a random access, isolation fluid based, analytical instrument. More particularly, the invention is directed to a wash cup for use with such instrument whereby a test sample as first liquid and fresh water as second liquid and isolation fluid, all of which being necessary for the operation of the instrument, can be introduced therein. Prior art devices which are presently in use with systems such as that described above and suffer from an inherent disadvantage. The isolation fluid normally used in such devices is a fluorinated oil having a specific gravity significantly greater than water. Accordingly, segments of the fluid settle to the bottom of the sampling device or wash cup, and disrupt the water level regulating activity of the cup. The present invention completely overcomes this serious difficulty representative of the prior art. The present invention relates to, and is directly usable in conjunction with, a random access, isolation fluid based analytical instrument. In such systems, conduits are used, the inner walls of which are coated with immiscible liquid, such as a fluorinated oil. In use, the reagent to be utilized in a particular assay and or the test sample to be assayed proceeds past one or more detection stations which, for example, can comprise a spectrophotometer or colorimeter, and discrete quantities of the test sample and or reagents may be separated by air or other separating fluid. In order to avoid such inadvertent mixing of the discrete liquid samples, the walls of the conduit are coated with an immiscible liquid such as is described in the Smyth, In Smythe, Diebler, Smythe, Each of the above patents has provided an advance of one sort or another in the elimination of successive sample intermixing and carryover. This end has been widely recognized as a major consideration in the improvement of of continous flow systems. The combined references provided a significant background literature on the technology available to prevent interaction of segments in continous flow analysis systems, and the disclosure of the references are hereby incorporated herein by reference thereto. Other aspects of the state of the art which are pertinent to the present invention include two continous flow assay instruments currently marketed by the assignee herein, Technicon Instruments Corporation, namely the Simultaneous Multichannel Analyzer SMA and the Simultaneous Multichanneled Analyzer with Computer SMAC . Both of these instruments utilize a mechanized probe for transferring a test sample and the reagent liquids into the flowing stream. However, in order to minimize cross contamination between successive samples, it is necessary to wash the probe. Accordingly, a washing cup is utilized with these instruments. Thus, the washing cup serves a to remove remnents of prior samples taken by the prove, i.e. b to clean the probe, c to inject successive aqueous samples into the flowing stream, d to assure a continous flow of fresh water through the cup, and e to assure that the liquid level remains relatively constant, thereby providing a relatively constant volume of fresh water for the instrument. The present invention comprises a wash cup for the containment of a probe in the form of a first liquid and a second liquid, the first liquid being substantially immiscible with and of substantially higher specific gravity than the second liquid the cup is provided with an inlet means for the second liquid and an outlet means serving to drain at least parts of first and second liquid out of the cup the cup also comprises a liquid level control means within said cup which communicates with the cup substantially under the liquid surface and with the outlet means additionally, the cup comprises a means located at the bottom of the cup and operable to permit passage of the first liquid from the cup directly to said outlet means to the substantially exclusion of the second liquid. The cup of the present invention is for use with a random access, isolation fluid based analytical instrument. The foregoing objects of the invention, and others, as well as the significant advances in the art represented by the present invention, are set forth in detail in the following description of the invention. The accompanying drawings are provided to further clarify various aspects of the present invention. Accordingly, FIG. 1 depicts a prior art device used on the SMA analytical system, and is a cross sectional view of the said device. Similarly, FIG. 2 is a cross sectional representation of a washing cup used with the SMAC analytical system mentioned above, and is a cross sectional view thereof. FIG. 3 is an isometric view of the present invention. FIG. 4 is a cross sectional view of the present invention along lines 4 4 in FIG.3. Referring initially to FIGS. 1 and 2, washing cups are depicted for cleaning the sample injection probe of the SMA and SMAC systems, respectively, both of which are commercially available from the assignee herein, i.e., Technicon Instruments Corporation. In FIG. 1, the washing cup 10 comprises a generally two body member 11 having an outlet 12 and inlet 13. Inlet 13 communicates with the body member 11 through conduit 14. In operation in conjunction with the SMA analytical system, water enters inlet 13 and is permitted to flow through conduit 14, thereby filling body member 11 until it reaches a level at or near the bottom of outlet 12. Accordingly, water flows entirely through the washing cup thereby maintaining a relatively clean flow of water. No provision is made, however, for use of such a cup with a random access, isolation fluid based analytical instrument such as is described in the Smyth, Referring to FIG. 2, there is depicted a washing cup 20 which is used with the commercially available SMAC analytical system, marketed by the present assignee Technicon Instruments Corporation. Accordingly, washing cup 20 comprises a generally tubular body member 21 provided with inlet means 22 and an outlet means 23. Mounted within the body member 21 is an overflow means 24, which is mounted in such a way as to provide upper chamber 25 and lower chamber 26. Water which enters through inlet means 22 into lower chamber 26 travels up the overflow means 24 until it reaches lip 27, whereupon the water overflows into upper chamber 25 and leaves the apparatus through outlet means 23. Turning now to the present invention, a preferred embodiment is depicted in FIGS. 3 and 4 which illustrate the preferred elements of the invention. Accordingly, FIG. 3 depicts an isometric view of a preferred cup in accordance with the present invention, and FIG. 4 is a cross section of the cup along the lines 4 4 of FIG. 3. In FIGS. 3 and 4, the body of the cup 30 is comprised of any suitable material such as a clear plastic similar to acrylic. The cup is formed through any suitable means such as molding, extrusion, machining, or combinations of such processes or other processes, all of which are known to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, inlet means 31 communicates with the cup portion 32, and the second liquid 42 enters the cup therethrough. As the level of the second liquid rises in cup 32, it simultaneously rises in overflow communication means 33. Communication means 33, together with overflow chamber 35 comprise the liquid level control means in the preferred embodiment. As liquid enters the cup and rises to level 34, it overflows into the overflow chamber and exits through conduit 36 and outlet means 37. The first liquid, which is immiscible with the second liquid is introduced into the cup via probe 38 which has been coated on its perimeter with the first liquid prior to its insertion into the cup 30. Upon immersion into the second liquid present in the cup, a small portion of the first liquid remains behind upon removel of the probe 38. Because of its immiscibility with the second liquid, the first liquid forms lens 39, and floats at the surface 40 of the second liquid present in the cup due to surface tension. Where the first liquid is of substantially higher specific gravity than the second liquid, as the lens forms, it eventually reaches a critical mass whereupon the weight of the lens partially overcomes the surface tension of the second liquid 42. This permits small portions 43 of the first liquid to settle to the bottom of the cup leaving the lens in position at the surface of the second liquid. In order to prevent the first liquid from accumulating to any appreciable extent in the cup, a means 41 is provided to permit the passage of the first liquid out of the cup eventually to leave the cup through outlet means 37. Ideally, the means 41 is porous poly tetrafluoroethylene known commercially as Teflon trademark of E. I. DuPont de Nemours of Wilmington, Delaware. Of course, it is understood that means 41 can be comprised of any suitable material which will permit the passage of the first liquid from cup 32 to outlet means 37 to the substantial exclusion of the second liquid such as a porous halogenated hydrocarbon polymer. In the preferred embodiment, means 41 is a porous Teflon plug having a pore size of from about 5 to 15 microns. Especially preferred in a Teflon plug having a pore size in the range of about 5 to 15 microns.
