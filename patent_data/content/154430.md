# Novel cloning vectors containing selectable genetic markers for use in streptomyces and related organisms.

## Abstract
The present invention discloses novel recombinant DNA cloning vectors for use in Streptomyces and related organ isms. These novel cloning vectors comprise a a functional origin of replication containing restriction fragment of plasmid pFJ301, and b one or more DNA segments that convey resistance to at least one antibiotic or colorimetric selectivity when transformed into a sensitive, restrictionless E. coli or Strep tomyces host cell that is susceptible to transformation, cell division, and culture.
