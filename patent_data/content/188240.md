# Apparatus for determining the position of best focus.

## Abstract
An apparatus for continuously determining the position of best focus of an objective lens 12 and a system having a video output is disclosed. The technique uses a transmissive plate 16 of variable thickness located on one side of the field stop 14 of the optical system associated with the video output. The plate covers the full vertical field of the system and covers on the order of 30 to 40 resolution elements in the horizontal direction. The plate is divided vertically into platelets 48 of different thicknesses which are distributed in such a way as not only to cover the range of defocus of the system, but to discriminate against possible variations in scene content. The plate is placed outside the active area which will be displayed by the video therefore the variations in thickness and in focus introduced by the plate are not displayed on the video, but are only used for the purpose of continuously determining the position of best focus. A spherical shell 13 of zero power may be placed between the objective lens 12 and the field stop 14 in order to create a bias so that focal shifts introduced by the plate 16 may be distributed about a nominal position, rather than all in a positive direction.
