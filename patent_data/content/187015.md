## Description
This invention relates to a squarilium compound and a liquid crystal composition containing the same. An information recording system using laser beams has recently been studied, wherein a liquid crystal having dissolved therein a compound which absorbs a laser beam of specific wavelengths is heated by irradiation of such a laser beam, whereupon the state of the irradiated portion is changed, for example, from an isotropically aligned state to a scattered state, as described, e.g., in On the other hand, it is known that a squarilium compound has photoconductivity and can be used, e.g., as an electric charge generator for electrophotographic light sensitive materials Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 105536 74, the term OPI as herein used referring to published unexamined application , a laser beam absorbing material for laser recording liquid crystal display devices Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 197485 84 and as a recording material for photodiscs Japanese Patent Application OPI Nos. 46221 81, 217758 83 and 129954 84 . However, conventionally known squarilium compounds involve problems of solubility such that they are soluble only in limited solvents, such as aprotic polar solvents, e.g., N,N dimethylformamide, N methylpyrolidone, N ,N dimethylacetamide, formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, etc., and also some of them have very poor solubility as in the case of Compound No. 6 disclosed in Japanese Patent Application OPI No. 129954 84. Further, many of these known compounds not only have the maximum absorption wavelengths in their solutions far aside from the oscillation wavelengths of semiconductor lasers, i.e., 780 nm, 830 nm or 850 nm but also lack in stability due to their insufficient light resistance. Reference GB A 2 140 023 discloses the use of the squarilium compound in a liquid crystal display device where video images are written into the cell comprising the liquid crystal material and the squarilium dye. The purpose of the dye is to improve the rate of transfer of heat from the laser to the liquid crystal material. These squarilium compounds suffer from problems of solubility being soluble only in limited solvents and furthermore also have the maximum absorption wave length in solutions in which they are soluble far aside from the oscillation wave lengths of semiconductor lasers used in information recording materials 850 nm, 830 nm or 780 nm . Also they lack stability due to their insufficient light resistance. In contrast the squarilium compounds of the invention have better than expected light resistance. Also they show excellent sensitivity to a 830 nm laser beam. The conventional squarilium compounds can, therefore, find only limited applications and are not satisfactorily applicable to various information recording materials, particularly those using a laser beam as a light source. Accordingly, an object of this invention is to provide a novel squarilium compound which can eliminate the above described problems associated with the known squarilium compounds, as well as a liquid crystal composition containing such a novel squarilium compound. That is, the present invention relates to a squarilium compound represented by the formula I wherein X represents Y represents and a liquid crystal composition containing the squarilium compound of the formula I .
