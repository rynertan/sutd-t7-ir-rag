# Device for applying terminals and similar metal elements to conductors, lengths of elastic material and the like.

## Abstract
The improvements relate to devices for applying termin als and the like to the ends of filiform bodies such as conductors, lengths of elastic material and other articles. For feeding the metal strip, formed from an interconnected succession of terminals or the like, and for rhythmically moving it into the position in which a terminal is applied to the filiform body and detached from the rest of the strip, the invention provides a pawl, which for this purpose engages the terminal, and is hinged to one end of a lever and subjected to the moment produced by a spring. The lever can rotate about an adjustable point between its ends. At its other end, the lever is hinged to a straight pin adjustably mounted in a guide member. This member is slidably mounted in the frame of the device and carries a roller. This roller cooperates with a cam associated with a mobile head carrying the cutting and bending tools which, respectively, detach the terminal or the like from the rest of the strip and bend its edges over in order to fix it to the conductor or other filiform body.
