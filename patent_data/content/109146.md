# Fuel fired heating element.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a fuel fired heating ele ment of the tubular kind particularly though not exlusively for use as an immersed heating tube in molten metals, salts or fluidised beds of solid particles for conductive heating or for use in an enclosed or partially enclosed chamber to pro vide radiant and convective heating. The element includes a tubular housing 1 having one end 2 closed and an opening to provide an outlet 4 for com bustion products. A burner assembly 6 is received with an annular clearance 51 within the housing between the outlet 4 and the closed end 2 and is arranged to direct its combus tion products as a stream towards the closed end 2. The tube 7 encloses with clearance three axially aligned tubes 60, 61 and 62 whose external and internal di ameters decrease sequentially from the burner 6 to the end 2.
