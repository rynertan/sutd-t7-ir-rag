# A device for gripping workpieces.

## Abstract
A device for moving gripping jaws into engagement with a workpiece comprising two coaxial fluid cylinders for mov ing the jaws. A piston fixedly connected with a gripping jaw moves in each of the cylinders. Fluid pressure is applied to opposite sides of the pistons to effect movement of the pis tons away and toward each other to thereby move the jaws away and toward each other. A means is provided to insure synchronous movement of the two pistons. The means com prises a rod extending along the axis of the two cylinders. The pistons and the rod have a driving interconnection. The driving interconnection effects rotation of the rod in opposite directions upon movement of the pistons away and toward each other. A bearing assembly located between the two fluid cylinders supports the rod for rotation.
