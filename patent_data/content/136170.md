# A semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory device in which the differential amplifier circuit compares a potential of a bit line to which memory cells storing information are connected with a refer ence potential of a dummy line to which a dummy cell is con nected, and detects information stored in each of the memory cells. The semiconductor memory device comprises a circuit which discharges both the bit line and the dummy line to a low potential when the chip enable inverted signal is supplied. When the chip enable signal is supplied, therefore, the differen tial amplifier circuit can detect a difference between the bit line potential and the dummy line potential before the bit line is fully charged up. This makes it possible to produce the chip enable access time and to realize higher speed operations.
