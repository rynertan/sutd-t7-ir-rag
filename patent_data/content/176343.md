# HOME BATHING UNIT

## Abstract
A bathing unit 1 is particularly designed for home use, and includes a bathtub 2 with an access opening 3 in one side and a vertically sliding door 4 . The bathing unit has a combination door guide and grab bar arrangement 5, 8, 9 , a slidable control console 6 , and a power door lock 7 , all of which permit the bather to readily operate the door 4 by himself, and to adjust the water temperature 111 , flow 113 and whirlpool 116 from a seated position within the bathtub and without the need for an assistant. The combination door guide and grab bar arrangement 5, 8, 9 includes a pair of support rods 8, 9 located on either side of the access opening 3 , which function both as a track on which the door 4 glides and as vertical grab bars. The slidable control console 6 allows a seated bather to move the bathing controls to a convenient location within easy reach. The power door lock 7 securely closes the door 4 without significant manual effort.
