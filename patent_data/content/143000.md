# Optical devices.

## Abstract
An optical device having controllable absorption for an optical signal having a wavelength corresponding to a photon energy not exceeding 1.2 eV comprises i a semicon ductor structure including one or more quantum well layers and ii means adapted for applying to the quantum well layer s an electric field such that the component of the field normal to the layer s may be controlled so as to determine the absorption edge of the quantum well layer s to be on either side of the optical signal wavelength. The device may be used as an optical modulator or switch and in optical demultiplexing.
