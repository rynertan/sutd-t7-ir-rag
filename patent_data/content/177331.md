# Method and apparatus for presenting waveforms on a liquid crystal display.

## Abstract
A liquid crystal display is provided for use in an oscilloscope. Analog multiplexing techniques enable displaying of waveforms of input signals with frequencies as high as 1 MHz. an xy grid is formed by two interleaved arrays of alternate parallel transparent electrodes 20 and 40 . Use of liquid crystal material 44 results in very low power consumption and voltage threshold, improved lifetime, a wide viewing angle, and no image washout at high ambient light levels. Addition of a digital voltmeter, frequency counter, auto sync circuitry, dual trace, and movable cursor expands the capabilities of the display. A gray scale surrounds the actual null points on the display, allowing suitable resolution with a minimum of channels.
