# Improvements in or relating to attachments for power tools.

## Abstract
A surface treatment attachment for a power tool, for example a sanding attachment for a handheld power drill 50 , has a body which can be secured to the power tool to be rotated thereby and which is arranged to receive a treatment head eg. a sanding disc 27 . With a view to enabling a consistently improved performance to be achieved under a variety of con ditions, means are provided for selecting the degree of ec centricity of the treatment head relative to axis of rotation of the body of the attachment. The degree of eccentricity may be continuously adjustable within pre set limits and, advan tageously, the attachment includes an arrangement for ac commodating a tilting movement of the treatment head.
