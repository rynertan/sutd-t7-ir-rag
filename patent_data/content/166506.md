# Breakaway fluid system.

## Abstract
The invention pertains to a breakaway coupling for use with fluid systems wherein self sealing coupling parts are inter connected by locking structure including a tubular displaceable operating member sealingly associated with a flexible conduit comprising a portion of the fluid system. Predetermined ten sion within the flexible conduit displaces the operating member to a coupling release position permitting the coupling parts to disengage and seal with minimum fluid loss.
