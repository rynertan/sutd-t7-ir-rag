## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a semiconductor memory device having a trench memory capacitor. First masks 16a, 16b are formed on an element forming region of a semicon ductor substrate 10 formed of the element forming region and an element isolation region. A film formed of a different material from that of the first masks 16a, 16b is deposited and is etched by anisotropic dry etching to leave second masks 20a, 20b around the first mask. The semiconductor substrate 10 is selectively etched using the first and sec ond masks as an etching mask so as to form a first groove 22, 122 in the element isolation region. An insulation film 24 is buried in the first groove. A portion of the first mask, formed at least above memory capacitor forming regions in the element forming region, is removed by etching, thereby forming a third mask on a portion excluding the memory ca pacitor forming region. The semiconductor substrate 10 is selectively etched by using the second and third masks and the insulation film 24 buried in the first groove as an etch ing mask so as to form second grooves 28a, 28b, 128a, 128b in the respective memory capacitor forming regions. A distance between the first and second grooves is defined by the second masks 20a, 20b in a self alignment manner. A capacitor electrode 34 is formed in the second grooves 28a, 28b, 128a, 128b through a gate insulation film 32 .
