## Description
T4 DNA Fragment as a Stabilizer for Proteins Expressed by Cloned DNA Background of the inventionThis invention relates to the field of recombinant DNA.In one of its aspects, this invention relates to a DNA fragment which inhibits degradation of abnormal proteins in bacterial cells. In another aspect, this invention relates to a method of isolating this stabilizing DNA fragment from T even phage particles. In another aspect, this invention relates to a plasmid containing the stabilizing DNA fragment. In yet.another aspect, this invention relates to a method of amplifying, foreign proteins encoded by cloned DNA by including the stabilizing DNA fragment into the genetic machinery of bacterial host cells.Most living cells possess efficient systems for recognizing and eliminating abnormal proteins. As used herein, the term abnormal proteins refers to proteins with abnormal conformations, protein fragments, polypeptide sequences containing amino acid analogues, missense mutant proteins, nonsense protein fragments, proteins encoded by cloned DNA and other polypeptides not ordinarily present in healthy, viable cells. In E. coli cells, for example, the half lives of protein fragments and protein with abnormal conformations aremuch shorter than the half lives of normal proteins.About 3 of normal proteins turns over each hour in E. coli cells, A normal proteins, however, are so short lived that they are found in much lower auantities than normal proteins or fail to acasulata to detectable levels.Little is known about the mechanism by which livinq cells detect and degrade abnormal proteins. Some infor tion is available about this system in E. ccli cells. See, for exanple, Simon et al. Nature, 275, 424 1978 . Zt is known that the degradation of normal proteins in E. coli cells is ATP dependent. If cellular ATP levels are substantially reduced, the turnover of abnormal proteins and protein fragments is also reduced. It is also believed that the ATP dependent degradative mechanism is bound to the E. coli cell membrane. However, the iden tities and functions of the enzymes responsible far rec ogniiing and degrading abnormal proteins remain obscure in E. coli and in other bacterial cells.The degradation systems possessed by living cells present a maj or obstacle to the manufacture of useful pro teins by means of recombinant DNA or molecular cloning procedures. By these procedures, the genes which code for eukaryotic proteins are introduced into host cells such as bacterial cells, which then express the foreign genes as the eukaryotic proteins. The recombinant DNA procedures involve isolating the relevant genes, in .serting them into suitable cloning vehicles, such as bacterial plasmids or viruses, and transforming host cells by introducing the hybrid cloning vehicles into the cells.The transformed cells which contain the rel evant genes are t ien selected from all the other cells and are grown in cultures. By such techniques, bacterial cells have been induced thus far to manufacture human growth hormone, human insulin, human interferon, etc. However, the bacterial cells apparently recognize these products as abnormal proteins, and under most circumstances, degrade them. Thus, the ability of living cells to detect and degrade abnormal proteins may se verely limit the yields of useful proteins obtained from cloned cells.To increase such yields, it would be highly desirable to provide a method for inhibiting or suppressing the degradation mechanism in cells carrying cloned genes. Such a method, when combined with already known recombinantDNA methods, would provide a highly efficient means for producing useful proteins It has previously been reported that the bacteriophage known as T4 influences the degradation function in E. coli cells. Simon et al., in Nature, suPra, reported that T4 infection of E, coli cells inhibits degradation of abnormal polypeptide sequences but does not affect the turnover rate of normal bacterial proteins. In the studies reported therein, it was found that adsorption of T4 particles to the E. coli surface and injection of T4 DNA were not by themselves sufficient to alter protein turnover. It was found that inhibition of degradation requires the synthesis of early T4 proteins. It was also reported therein that other phges, such as TS and T7, also inhibit degradation in E. coli cells but not so to great an extent as does T4 phage.However, infecting S. coli cells with T4,T5 or T7, phage particles is fatal to the host cells, and this method is unsuitable for amlifying proteins expressed by cloned DNA. The bacteriophage T4 together with the bacteriophages T2 and T6 form a faintly of bacteriophages known as T even phages. The T even phages are almost identical in structure, composition and properties. Thus, one of ordinary skill in the art would conclude that all members of the T even bacteriophage family contain genes which suppress degradation.In order to maximize the yields of eukaryotic proteins produced by recombinant DNA techniques, it would be highly desirable to excise from T even phages,especiallyT4 phage particles the.gene s responsible for inhibiting the degradation mechanism and to insert the same gene s into bacterial host cells. In this manner, the degradation mechanism of cells carrying cloned DNA can be turned off without killing the cells as by infection with T4 phage particles. It is an object of the invention to provide a DNA fragment from T even.phage particles which will inhibit the degradation of abnormal proteins in bacterial host cells.It is another object of the invention to provide a cloning vehicle such as a bacterial plasmid, which contains the stabilizing T even DNA fragment.It is another object of the invention to provide bacterial cells containing the hybrid cloning vehicle with the stabilizing T even DNA fragment.It is still another object of the invention to provide transformants which contain the genes for producing eukaryotic proteins as well as the stabilizing T4 DNA fragment.It is still another object of the invention to provide a method for suppressing the degradation of abnormal proteins in a bacterial cell.It is still another object of the invention to provide a DNA fragment coding for protein that suppresses degradation of abnormal proteins in bacterial cells.These objects are accomplished by means of the present invention.Summary of the inventionA primary subject matter of the invention is a DNA fragment isolated from the DNA of a T even bacteriophage, said DNA fragment consisting essentially of a sequence of nucleotide bases which code for protein that suppresses degradation of abnormal polypeptides in bacterial cells.The said DNA fragment may be a fragment wherein the nucleotide bases code for protein that suppresses degradation in gram negative bacterial cells.Preferably the said DNA fragment is a fragment wherein the nucleotide bases code for protein that suppresses degradation in E. coli cells.The said DNA fragment may also be a fragment wherein the nucleotide bases code for protein that suppresses degradation in Pseudomonas, Aerobacter,.Salmonella, Proteus or Serratia cells.The said DNA fragment can further be a fragment wherein the nucleotide bases code for protein that suppresses degradation in gram positive bacterial cells.Preferably the latter DNA fragment is a fragment wherein the nucleotide bases code for protein that suppresses degradation in Bacillus subtilis cells.

Another subject matter of the invention finally is a method for suppressing the degradation of abnormal proteins in a bacterial cell comprising producing the above mentionedDNA fragment,inserting said DNA fragment into a cloning vehicle to produce a hybrid cloning vehicle, and transforming a bacterial cell by introducing said hybrid cloning vehicle therein.In this method of the invention the cloning vehicle used is preferably a plasmid and the bacterial cell is an E.coli cell or a Bacillus subtilis cell or one of the other microorganisms mentioned above.The method of isolating the stabilizing DNA fragment according to the present invention comprises treating the DNA of a T even bacteriophage with a restriction enzyme to cleave the DNA into fragments, at least one of said fragments coding for protein that causes the suppression of degradation of abnormal proteins in bacterial cells, inserting said DNA fragments into cloning vehicles, such as bacterial plasmids, to produce hybrid cloning vehicles, transforming bacterial cells by introducing said hybrid cloning vehicles therein, and selecting the transformants which exhibit suppressed degradation of abnormal proteins. As used herein, the term hybrid cloning vehicle refers b roadly to a cloning vehicle, such as a bacterial plasmid, containing a T even DNA insert. The method of the invention leads to an increase in the yield of proteins expressed by cloned DNA in a bacterial cell by inserting the DNA fragment into a cloning vehicle, such as a bacterial plasmid, to produce a hybrid cloning vehicle, and transforming the bacterial cell containing the cloned DNA by introducing said hybrid cloning vehicle into said bacterial cell. Detailed description of the inventionThe invention will now be explained in more detail with reference being made to T4 phage which is preferred for the isolation of the DNA fragment of the invention. It is expressly stated however, that the invention is not restricted to this embodiment, but that other T even phages can also be used.The genetic map of T4 phage is known to be circular and to contain about 150 genes. About 40 different T4 gene products, each coded by a specific T4 gene, interact to produce the coat proteins which form the mature virus particle. It is not known how many genes are responsible for suppressing degradation of abnormal proteins in bacterial hosts. Nor is it known which proteins are ex pressed by these genes. However, as a result of the practices of the present invention, it has been learned that a DNA fragment which codes for protein that functions to suppress degradation of abnormal proteins in bacterial cells originates from the vicinity of gene 49 of the T4 genetic map.Wais, et. al., in Virology, 39, 153 1969 , have reported that T4 phage is able to replicate when injected into a variety of bacteria, including E. coli strain B 4,Salmonella, Aerobacter, Proteus, and Serratia. Thus, the genetic machinery of T4 is unimpaired and is able to function essentially normally when inserted in a wide variety of host cells. withe genetic nucleic acid present in the core of the T4 phage particle is double stranded DNA. T4 DNA comprises about 3.6 x 105 base pairs ca. 1.2 x 108 . There are twice as many A T base pairs as C C base pairs. T4DNA is unusual in that it contains the base 5 OE methyl cytosine in place of the more usual cytosine More over, one or more glucose residues are attached to some are T4 DNA. 5 Oof the 52OH cytosine groups methylosie,. like cytosine, forms base pairs with. guanine. The present of 5 OHE methylcytosine and its glucose derivatives in place of cytosine has no bearing on the genetic properties of T4 phage. The biological significance of the unusual base has not yet been clearly established although it is believed that its function is to protect T4 DNA from a phage specific enzyme which destroys nnmodified DNA. Xn accordance with the present invention, a process is disclosed for isolating a specific DNA fragment from Teven phage particles which will suppress degradation of abnormal proteins, such. as foreign proteins encoded by cloned DNA, in bacterial cells. The process begins with the extr2cXion of DNA from the capsids of T even phage particlesT even DNA may. be extracted from the capsids of the T even particles by well known methods. Both cheTnical or mechanical methods are known to remove the DNA from theT even particles although chemical methods are preferred since they are less lively to damage the DNA.For purposes cf the present invention, it is preferable that the DNA come from T even mutants in which the DNA is cytosinecontaining and nonalncosylated. This form of DNA is pre ferried since most restriction enzymes will not act on wild type T4 DNA. Furthermore, wiid tye T4 DNA may not be transcribed in host cells as well as cytosine con taming, nonglucosylated DNA.After the DNA has been extracted from the T even phaga particles, the DNA is digested with a suitable restriction endonuclease The restriction enzyme scans the DNA strand and cleaves it into fragments whenever a particular short sequence of nucleotides is encountered.Each restriction enzyme therefore cleaves the T even DNA into a character istic set of fragments which can be separated, if desired, by well known methods such as gel electrophoresis. It is essential that the restriction enzyme not cleave the DNA within the gene s responsible for suppressing degradation of abecrmaL proteins. A variety of restriction enzymes have been found suitable for the practice of the present invention, including such well known endonucleases as Pst T and Eco RT. To isolate the specific T even DNA fragment containing the stabilizing gene 5 , the fragments are inserted izito suit able cloning vehicles to produce hybrid cloning vehicles. Both viruses and plasmids are suitable cloning vehicles, however, bacterial plasmids carrying genes which serve as recognition markers, such as antibiotic resistance, may be preferred. For example, the readilv avaiiable plasmid pBR 325, which confers resistance to ampicillin, chlorzm phenicol, and tetracycline, or the readily available plasmid pBR 322, which confers resistance to ampicillin and tetracycline, are suitable cloning vehicles for the present invention. The T even DNA fragments can be inserted into the cloning vehicles, such as the bacterial plasmids, by a variety of enzymatic techniques. When the T even DNA has been cleaved with a restriction enzyme leaving sticky ends , the sa e restriction enzyme. can be used to cleave open the appropriate bacterial plasmid.The bacterial plasmid will then have matching sticky ends and the DNA fragments can be directly annealed to the bacterial plaszids.. However, if the restriction enzyme leaves blunt ends, the enzyme terminal transferase can be used to provide a short sequence of identical bases, such as four cytosines, to the DNA fragments. The fragments can then be annealed to the plasmid DNA to which a complementary sequence of bases four guanines have been added.The hybrid cloning vehicles are next inserted into bacterial host cells. Treatment with a dilute solution of cal cium chloride is known to render the cell walls penneable to plasmids. E. coli cells have been found to be suitable host cells for expressing the stabilizing DNA fragment although the method of the present invention is not confined to these cells. F, doli is classified as a gramnegative species of bacteria. Other gram negative bacteria such as vs2ucomonas, Aerobacter, etc., are also suitable hosts for expressing the stabilizing function of theDNA fragment. With suitable modification in the ShineDalgar sequence, gram positive bacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis, will also serve as suitable hosts for the sta bilizing DNA fragment. The modification techniques are conventionally known in the art. To select the hot cells which have been transformed bv the hybrid cloning vehicles, bacteria are grown first in a non selective medium and then in a selective medium, For ex ample, the restriction enzvme Pst I cuts the plasmid of 0 pBR 325 in the midst of the gene which confers ampicillin resistance, but leaves the genes which confer chlora ohen icol and tetracycline resistance intact. Thus , one can select the transformed cells containing inserts in thePst I site of pBR 325 by screening for resistance to chloramphenicol and tetracycline and sensitivity to cillin.To isolate those transformants containing the stabilizingDNA fragment, the transformants are screened for those which exhibit suppressed degradation of abnormal proteinsA test based upon the ability of tpmperatn e sensitive phage mutants to propagate in the transformants has been found suitable for this purpose. At appropriate temper atures, the phage mutant will only grow in host cells having defective mechanisms for degradation of abnormal proteins. For example, the phage mutant known as lOts is a X phage with a defect in gene O. The 10 protein is vital to the survival of the virus.Wild type phage is able to propagate in E. coli 2t30 and at39oC. lOts, however, is unable to propagate at 39 C unless the degradation mechanism of the E. coli cells is impaired see Simon et al., Proc. Nat. Ac ad. Sci. USA, 76, 1623 1979 . Thus, the trans.fo ants containing the desired T even DNA fragment can be Se elected by their ability to propagate the lOts phage mutants at 300C and at 39eC. If desired, these transfo ants can be tested further for their ability to degrade abnormal proteins and protein fragments by methods described in Simon et al., Nature, supra.In this manner transformants are isolated having an im paired degradation mechanism. The transformants contain a hybrid cloning vehicle such as a plasmid, in which aDNA fragment from T even phage has been inserted ThisDNA fragment is functional in bacteria, and contains the genetic information required to inhibit abnormal protein degradation.The plasmid can be removed from the selected transformants and introduced into other host cells where it will inhibit degradation in the new host cells. The new host cells are not confined to E. coli but may be any of a wide variety of bacterial cells, including Pseudomoflas, Aerobacter, etcr and, with suitable modification of the Shine Dalgar sequence, bacillus suS is, etc. The new host cells may additionally carry an appropriate recombinant plasmid for producing eukaryotic proteins. The presence. of the stabilizing DNA fragment will increase dromstically the yields of the eukaryotic proteins.Alternatively, the T even DNA fragment may be excised from the hybrid plasmid by treatment with a restriction enzyme, for example, Pst. I. The DNA fragment may then be inserted into a cloning vehicle, such as a plasmid, already carrying a gene for producing a eukaryotic pro tein. when the new recombinant plasmid is introduced into a host cell, the yields of the eukaryotic protein will be greatly increased.After the stabilizing DNA fragment has been isolated, it may be subjected to further analysis and study. For example, the DNA fragment can be seauenced by laborious but well known techniques The DNA fragment may also be subcloned to find the smallest DNA fragment which would inhibit degradation in bacterial cells. Slnnclonng can be accomplished by digesting the stabilizing DNA fragment with a variety of restriction enzymes in order to cut it into smaller fragments . Each of these pieces can then be inserted into a plasmid and then cloned in a bacterial.host. The hosts can then be screened for inpaired degradation.In this rttanner, the smallest DNA fragment can be isolated which codes for protein that suppresses degradation of abnormal proteins in bacteria. The practices of the present invention may be further illustrated by the following examples Example 1For purposes of testing the practices of the present invention, DNA was extracted by well known methods from T4 mutants having the following mutations alc , den A den 3 , 42 , 56 . These mutations result in T4 particles having cytosine ccntaining, nonglycosylated DNA.The DNA from the T4 mutants was cleaved with the restriction endonuclease Pst I. This restriction enzyme recognizes the nucleotide sequence CTGCA G and cuts the T4 DNA between A and G wherever this sequence appears. Digestion of T4 DNA with Pst I produced about 35 DNA fragments of various lengths.At the same time, the bacterial plasmid known as pBR 325 was also cleaved with Pst I. Pst I cleaved pBR 325 provides chioramphenicol and tetracycline resistance but not ampicillin resistance The T4 DNA fragments were then directly annealed to the Pst I cleaved pBR 325 plasmids to produce hybrid plasmids. E. coli cells, strain C600 a K12 strain were then transformed by mixing with the pBR 325 plasmids in a dilute solution of calcium chloride The transformed bacteria were grown first in a nonselective medium, and then in a selective medium which screened for chloramphenicol and tetracycline resistance and ampicillin sensitivity. Zn this way individual transformants which had taken lip the hybrid pBR 325 plasmids were isolated and cultured as colonies. Each of the colonies was given a number. To isolate the E. coli transformants which contain the stabilizing DNA fragment, individual transformants were cultured. The cultures were then infected with 0ts mutants and incubated as plate assays at 300, 370 and 39 C. The number of plaques per plate for each culture was. counted. The relative efficiency of plaque formation for sAt Acted cultures is shown in. Table l. TA TABLE 1 Efficiency af Placue Format Ät PLASMID 30 C 37 C 39 C pBR 325 1 0.38 0.02 Pst 30 1 0.78 0.78 Pst 83 1 1.43 0.76 Pst 91 1 1.43 1.11In Table I, the designation pBR 325 indicates host cells containing the plasmid pBR 325. These cells served as a control. The designation Pst 30 indicates host cells containing the plasmid pBR 325 with the T4 DNA insert of colony 30. Similarly Pst 83 and Pst 91 indicate host cells containing the plasmid pBR 325 with the T4 DNA in serbs of colonies 83 and 91 respectively. As can be seen in Table 1, the ability of lots to propagate at 390C was drastidally reduced in E. ccli cells having only the pBR 325 control. However, lOts was able to propagate well at 390C in F. coli cells having the T4DNA inserts of colonies 30, 83 and 91. The ability of 0ts to propagate at 39 C was due to the suppressed degradation of abnormal protein in the E. coli cells having the T4 DNA inserts of colonies 30, 83 and 91. Example 2The hybrid plasmids of Example 1 were introduced intoE. coli cells, strain SG 13062 a K12 strain . Transformants were examined for their ability to degrade puromycyl protein fragments by the methods described inSimon et al., Nature,supra. The results are shown in Fig. 1, wherein the designations are the same as n in. Example I. As can be seen in rig. 1, E. coli cells containing T4 .DNA fragments from colonies 83 and 91 show substantially lower levels of degradation than E. coli cells containing only the pBR 325 plasmid. Moreover, these E. coli cells exhibited no change in the turnover rate of normal pro teins. Example 3 The hybrid plasmid Pst 91 was introduced into E. coli cells, strains SG 13062 and SG 13069 both K12 strains . SG 13062 served in this example as a wild type E. coli strain.SG 13069 is identical to SG 13062 except that SG 13069 carries the mutation designated lon . This mutation of the E. coli genome reduced the efficiency of the degradation mechanism. The E. coli transformants were examined for their ability to degrade puromycyl polpeptides, The results are shown in Fig. 2. The results demonstrate that E. coli cells having the stabilizing T4 DNA frag ment exhibit less degradation of abnormal proteins than E. coli lon mutants. rig. 2 also shows that degrada tion is smallest in Ion mutants having the stabilizing T4 DNA fragment. amp3 e 4 E. coli cells of the strain designated 294 a K12 strain were transformed with plasmid Pst 91 or with pBR 325. The E. coli cells had previously been transformed with the plasmid designated PACY184IP. This plasmid contains the gene which codes for human fibroblast interferon. The transformants were cultured and the interferon production was assayed. The results are shown in Table 2. Table 2 PLASMIDS INTEREFERON units ml culture PACY184IF Iso PACYl184 pBR 325 150 PACY184IF Pst 91 600Table 2 demonstrates that . coli clones carrying the gene for human interferon and the stabilizing T4 DNA fragment yielded four times as much interferon as clones not having the T4 DNA fragment. Example 5The T4 DNA fragment was excised from Pst 91 with Pst I and inserted into the plasmid designated 177. Plasmid 177 con.tained the gene coding for human fibroblast interferon. E.coli cells, strain 294, were transformed with the new plasmid designated 177 91. The trans ormants were cul tured and the interferon was extracted after freeze thaw cycles and assayed. The results are shown in Table 3.

Example 6E. coli cells, strain 294 were transfo ed with the plasmid 177 91 as in Example 5. The transfo ants were ciii turd and the interferon was extracted following treatment of the cells with the detergent Triton X100. The interferon was assayed and the results are shown in Table 4. Table 4 PLASMID INTERFERON units ml culture 177 300 177 91 2400In this case, the host cells having the stabilizing T4DNA fragment yielded eight times as much interferon as cells without the fragment. While the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments, this should not be construed to limit the spirit or the scope of the invention.
