# AIR FUEL RATIO CONTROL SYSTEM FOR AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE

## Abstract
An air fuel ratio control system having solenoid actuated valves 71, 73 disposed in the fuel passage and the air bleed communicated with the fuel passage of a carbure tor 5 , an electric memory memorizing the data concerning the opening rates of the solenoid actuated valves for attain ing a constant air fuel ratio through driving of these valves, in relation to the engine speed N and the intake vacuum VC of the engine, and a controller adapted to control the solenoid actuated valves at an opening rate which is given as the product of the data read out from the electric memory and a fuel increment coefficient which differs according to the state of engine operation such as acceleration, decelera tion and so forth of the engine and which varies depending on the engine temperature TW . A correction of the air fuel ratio is performed in accordance with the engine tempera ture TW . When the engine is intentionally accelerated or decelerated during warming up of the engine, the rate of fuel supply from the carburetor 5 is changed in accordance with such a change of engine operation to always optimize the ai fuel ratio of the mixture.
