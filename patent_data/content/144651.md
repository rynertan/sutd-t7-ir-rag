# Ball valve and method of manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
A ball valve in which, even when a connecting sleeve 7 is removed by loosening the associated union nut 71 , the ball 2 and annular seals 33, 43 of the valve will not blow out the valve body under fluid pressure. A ball 2 with an integral spindle 5 is arranged in the valve body 1 in such a manner as to be able to open and close a fluid passage therein 31, 41 . A seat 11 is formed in the valve body 1 and a part of the surface of the ball 2 on the side thereof opposite the side where the spindle 5 is provided and around a rotational axis of the spindle 5 is in surface contact with the seat 11 to thereby pivotally support the ball 2 . Annular seals 33, 43 are provided in the fluid passage abutting against the ball 2 from both sides to pivotally support the ball with the annular seals 33, 43 being urged towards the ball by seal carriers 3, 4 .
