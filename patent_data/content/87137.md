# TRIALKYLAMINE SULFUR DIOXIDE CATALYZED SULFENYLATION OF CARBAMATES

## Abstract
An improved process for suifenyiating carbofuran in the presence of a solvent and acid acceptor with a disubstituted aminosulfenyl halide, in which the reaction is conducted in the presence of a catalytic amount of a complex of a lower alkylamine and sulfur dioxide, is disclosed and exemplified.
