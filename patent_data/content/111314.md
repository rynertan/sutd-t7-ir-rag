# Mailing machine and envelope ejection mechanism for a mailing machine.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a stand alone electronic mailing machine that includes a postage metering device. The invention has particular utility when utilized in a mailing machine of the reciprocating platen type. The entire drive mechanism, setting mechanism, and control devices as well as the postage metering mechanisms are all contained in one housing so that there is no need for a separate base. In the mailing machine of this invention, a single central processing unit is utilized along with memory for the purpose of accounting for the postage value that has been charged into the mailing machine as well as the amount that has been used. An envelope ejection mechanism 416 is provided to remove an envelope 234 from the mailing machine after postage has been printed thereon. Included in the envelope ejection mechanism is a provision 430 for applying pressure to an envelope 234 being ejected so that the contents thereof will move in unison with the envelope.
