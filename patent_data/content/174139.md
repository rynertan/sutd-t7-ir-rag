## Description
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MAKING A PILE WEATHERSTRIP COIL The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for making a coil of pile weatherstrip or like crushable elongate material, and more especially, a coil of pile weatherstrip with a central barrier fin such as our FIN SEAL strip. The invention is particularly suitable for making a coil of pile weatherstrip which has a central barrier fin which projects beyond the sealing surface of the pile. We market such weatherstrip as HI FIN weatherstrip. In the past, such weatherstrip has been coiled in traditional fashion on a reel, in the same manner as wire, and has been wound upon itself under tension. This means that once coiled, the weatherstrip in the coil is under compression. This is satisfactory for some weatherstrip, but with pile weatherstrip, there is a tendency for the weatherstrip to be wound so tight that the pile is crushed. This can have an adverse effect on the performance of the weatherstrip.The damage to the weatherstrip is even worse when a barrier fin is provided, especially if it upstands from the pile, because the barrier fin will be crushed, and more often than not, will be laid over the pile, sometimes one way and sometimes the other, so that when the weatherstrip is removed from the reel for installation in a window or door, the fin will be laid over the pile in random fashion to the left and right, and may not upstand from the pile at all. As a result, the fin, instead of enhancing the sealing and other performance properties of the weatherstrip, will have an adverse effect. The present invention seeks to overcome the problems associated with the traditional coiling of weatherstrip on reels. According to the present invention, we provide apparatus for making a coil of pile weatherstrip or like crushable elongate material, comprising a reel on which the weatherstrip is to be wound, said reel having a central circumferentially discontinuous core or hub and two spaced side walls extending radially from the core, and separable from each other, and both of which have a discontinuous circumferential periphery to allow weatherstrip wound upon the reel to be wrapped round with at least one band of tape or the like to prevent unreeling when it is removed from the reel after separation of said side walls. Preferably, the apparatus also includes means for winding the weatherstrip on the reel under minimum tension so that the coil is under little or no compression. Each side wall could comprise a spider, generally in the form of a plurality of arms extending radially from a central region, and the central core or hub could be provided by a plurality of bars extending between opposed arms of the two spiders, each of the bars being at the same spacing from the centre of the central region. Preferably, however, the reel comprises two generally circular side plates, each with a plurality of recesses opening from their periphery towards a central region, and between the recesses, projections which are preferably of equal length located at a greater distance from the centre of each side plate than the bottom of each recess, which form the discontinuous core or hub when the two side plates are assembled concentrically together in parallel spaced relationship. Preferably, each side plate has four recesses therein at 900 intervals, and each projection is spaced circumferentially about 300 from a recess, so that the plates can be assembled with their recesses directly opposite each other, with two projections between each pair of recesses, spaced about 300 apart, one connected to one plate and the other to the other plate. The projections may be provided by L shaped members, one of the limbs of each of which is secured to its respective plate, and the other limb of which forms the projection, and the free end face of which abuts the opposite plate. Preferably, quick release means is provided to allow separation of the side walls. The quick release means may comprise nuts and bolts or pivoting latches. Preferably also, means is provided on at least one of the plates to assist in correctly aligning it with the other plate. Preferably, each projection is lined, at least on its radial outermost face, with soft material, e.g. pile. The means for winding the weatherstrip on the reel may comprise a feeder arm having a head with aT shaped slot therein, which preferably lays the weatherstrip in position with the pile facing inwards, and which moves radially outwards for each layer so as not to tension the weatherstrip and lay it loosely on the reel. Preferably, the arm can move from side to side axially of the reel to lay the weatherstrip on the reel. This arm may rotate around the reel, but it is preferred that the reel is rotated about a pivot axis located at the centre of its side walls so that the arm can move just from side to side and radially in and out. Also according to the present invention, we provide a method of making a coil of pile weatherstrip or like crushable material comprising winding the weatherstrip under minimum compression onto a reel which has a central core with a discontinuous circumference and two spaced separable side walls extending radially from the core, and which have discontinuous peripheries, wrapping the resultant coil of weatherstrip with at least one band of material to prevent unwinding of the coil, separating the side walls of the reel, and removing the banded coil of weatherstrip or like material from the reel. Preferably, the method includes the step of feeding the weatherstrip to the reel with an arm which is movable towards and away from a central rotational axis of the reel so that each layer of weatherstrip on the reel is laid gently onto the reel or a preceding layer under minimum compression. Preferably, the arm is also moved to and fro to lay the weatherstrip on the reel. Preferably, the reel is rotated relative to the arm and the weatherstrip is wound on the reel with its pile facing inwards. This is particularly advantageous when a barrier fin is associated with the pile, because when the weatherstrip is coiled, the tip of the fin will lie on a circle of smaller diameter than the base of the fin, thus causing the free edge or tip to corrugate slightly. This then supports the next outer layer of pile weatherstrip and acts as a cushion for it. This means that the resultant coil of weatherstrip has a resiliently deformable support built into it, which means that the whole coil is less likely to be damaged during transit, and is itself self supporting and resiliently deformable. The side wall may be separated by removing nuts from one end of a plurality of bolts extending between the side walls and holding the side walls together, or by releasing pivoting latches on the ends of the bars or other quick release means. The invention is now described by way of example with reference to the accompanying schematic drawings, in which FIGURE 1 is a perspective view of one possible construction of reel, with a coil of weatherstripping formed on the reel FIGURE 2 is an inside elevation of one side wall plate of the reel in Figure 1 with the coil still in the position in which it is wound and showing a feed arm for the weatherstrip FIGURE 3 is an end view of a dispenser head for laying the weatherstrip on the reel, and FIGURE 4 is a section on the line IV IV ofFigure 4. Referring to Figures 1 and 2 of the drawings, a reel 1 is shown, made up of two spaced side walls 3,5, each in the form of a circular plate, having a plurality of recesses 4 therein, extending from the periphery of the plate towards the centre. As shown, four recesses 4 are provided in each plate, at 900 spacings. On each plate, between each recess 4, a projection 7, provided by one arm of anL shaped bracket 6, is provided, the other arm of each bracket 6 being secured to the side wall plate 3 or 5 in known manner, spaced approximately 300 from its respective recess 4.Thus, when the two side wall plates as shown in Figure 2, with their projection 7, are assembled in parallel spaced relationship, as shown in Figure 1, with the recesses in one plate opposite those in the other plate, there will be two projections 7 extending between each adjacent pair of recesses 4, one projecting from the side wall plate 3 and the other from the side wall plate 5, one spaced about 300 and the other about 600 from each recess 4. It is important, as will become apparent, that the projections 7 lie on a circle, the radius of which is greater than that on which the bases of the recesses 4 lie. It will thus be appreciated that the eight projections 7, formed by the projecting arms of the brackets 6 provide a central, generally circular, core or hub for the reel with a discontinuous circumference on which a coil 9 of weatherstrip or the like is to be formed. The weatherstrip for the coil 9 is dispensed from a feeder arm 20 which is shown in more detail in Figures 3 and 4 to which reference is now also made. The feeder arm 20 comprises a dispensing head 10 having a holder 21 with a T shaped slot therein, which is supported on an arm 11. The holder 21 is supported on bolts 22 passing through the top of the head 10. The position of the holder 21 in the head 10 can be varied by screwing up or unscrewing nuts 23 to accommodate weatherstrips of different heights. The holder 21 is held in position by coil springs 24 encircling the bolts 22 and located between the holder 21 and the top of the head 10.If desired, the holder 21 may be changed to accommodate weather or other strips of different widths by unscrewing completely the nuts 23 and inserting a new holder. The head 10 is movable towards and away from a rotational axis 13 of the reel, and is also movable to and from across the width of the reel between the side walls, so as to lay weatherstrip in place, as shown. By moving the arm outwardly away from axis 13 as each layer of weatherstrip is layered onto the reel, the weatherstrip is coiled under minimum compression so as not to crush the weatherstrip. It is preferred that the weatherstrip is guided as shown in Figure 3 by the T shaped slot in the holder 21 in the head 10 with its pile facing inwards, especially if the pile incorporates a barrier fin.When there is a barrier fin, it is almost impossible to coil such weatherstrip with its barrier fin facing outwards, because the barrier fin acts as a flange on a T beam. However, with the fin facing inwards, its free edge can collapse by zig zagging or corrugating it will lie on a circumference of smaller radius than the base strip of the weatherstrip . In the finished coil, this corrugated fin supports the next layer of weatherstrip, and provides a cushion effect, thus improving the durability of the coil and giving it a resilience which improves its recovery characteristics during transport. The arm 11 could be moved around the reel, but it is easier for the reel to be rotated, as shown, in the direction of the arrow B. Once the coil 9 of weatherstrip has been built up as shown in the drawings, one or more bands 15 four, one for each recess, are preferred of tape, wire, string or the like are wrapped around the coil 9 to hold it in place, and the weatherstrip can then be severed from that on the supply arm 11. Ideally, the bands 15 are formed of tape on which a trade mark or brand name can be printed. The provision of the discontinuous hub or core, and the recesses 4 providing a discontinuous periphery for the side walls 3 and 5, allows the band 15 easily to be placed in position. After the coil 9 has been secured, the side walls 3 and 5 are separated from each other. This can be achieved by first releasing or removing quick release fittings or nuts and bolts not shown or preferably a single screw spindle 17. The banded coil can then be removed from the reel. The walls 3,5 are shown as being spaced apart by the eight projections. A different number could be provided. The projections 7 are preferably lined, at least on their surfaces which support the inner layer of weatherstrip, with a soft material, e.g. pile material or foam, to prevent crushing of the weatherstrip. The present invention also extends to a coil of pile weatherstrip wound by the method and apparatus described above. The weatherstrip may be fed to the head 10 by a capstan, or by means of a pair of rollers, the speed of which is controlled to ensure there is little or no tension in the coil. The feed mechanisms are the subject of a further patent application in our name. It will of course be understood that the present invention has been described above purely by way of example, and modifications of detail can be made within the scope and spirit of the invention.Coils of elongate material other than weatherstrip can of course be made using the apparatus and method of the invention.
