# Substituted m phenylenediamines.

## Abstract
Novel meta phenylenediamines are provided having one or two particular benzyl radicals as substituents along with other optional substituents on the aromatic diamine ring and optionally substituents on the benzyl aromatic ring. The diamines are sterically hindered and thereby have lower amine reactivity as compared with the unsubstituted diamines. The diamines are useful as curing agents for epoxy resins and find particular utility as extenders in the formation of novel polyurethane polyurea polymers.

## Description
DESCRIPTION 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to aromatic amines and is more particularly concerned with a novel class of alkylated metaphenylenediamines.2. Description of the Prior Art Aromatic amines and particularly aromatic diamines are well known types of compounds finding many applications in the chemical art.Typically, aromatic amines have found utility as starting materials and intermediates in the preparation of other products such as isocyanates, pharmaceuticals, various types of polymers, plastics, and the like. Some of the aromatic diamines find particular utility as curatives in various polymer systems. Other known classes of aromatic diamines include, typically, the a,a bis aminoaryl xylenes disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,424,795 the limited number of nuclear alkylated aromatic amines and diamines disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,678,112 3,678,113 and 3,862,233 the alkylated toluenediamines and alkylated 4,4 diaminodiphenylmethanes disclosed in U.S. Patents 3,428,610 and 4,218,543 certain meta or para isopropenylphenylbenzyl derivatives of aromatic mono and diamines in German DS 17 686 97 and finally simple diamines such as the diaminodiphenylmethanes, toluenediamines, and the like. I have now discovered a novel class of sterically hindered aromatic meta phenylene diamines which are easily obtained from readily available starting materials. Further, the aromatic diamines in accordance with the present invention exhibit a wide range of amine basicity or reactivity depending on the extent of the steric hindrance which, in turn, depends on the extent of the substitution in the three possible positions ortho to the two amino groups on the aromatic ring. Not only can the amine reactivity, i.e., amine basicity, be varied depending on the substitution noted above but other important molecular properties such as compound solubility and melting ranges can be influenced depending on the particular structure and or isomer mixtures chosen. The ability to influence amine basicity in the present diamines makes them particularly useful as chain extenders in polyurethane polyurea polymers which application will be discussed in detail below as part of the present invention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention comprises m phenylenediamines I having a at least one, and not more than two, of the positions ortho to the amino groups substituted by a member selected from benzyl groups having the formulae EMI2.1 wherein R1 is selected from the class consisting of hydrogen and lower alkyl, R2 is lower alkyl, CnHzn is alkylene having from 2 to 5 carbon atoms in the chain, R is an inert substituent, n is an integer from 0 to 5, m is an integer from 0 to 4 and b a member selected from the group consisting of hydrogen and lower alkyl attached to the nuclear carbon atoms ortho to the amino groups which do not carry one of said benzyl groups. This invention also comprises m phenylenediamines according to the above definition which are additionally substituted by hydrocarbyl on the nuclear carbon atom which is in the meta position with respect to the two amino groups.

This invention also comprises polyurethane polyurea polymers prepared by reaction of an organic polyisocyanate, a polyol, and an extender wherein the improvement comprises employing as the extender a m phenylenediamine according to I above. The term lower alkyl means alkyl having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, inclusive, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, amyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, and isomeric forms thereof. The preferred lower alkyl radicals have 1 to 4 carbon atoms and are as defined above. The term alkylene from 2 to 5 carbon atoms means 1,2 ethylene, 1,3 propylene, 1,2 propylene, 1,4 butylene, 1,3 butylene, 1,2 and 2,3 butylene, 1,5 pentylene, 1,4 pentylene, 1,2 , 2,3 , 1,3 and 2,4 pentylene, and the like. Preferred alkylene is 1,2 ethylene. The term hydrocarbylz means the monovalent radical obtained by removing one hydrogen atom from the parent hydrocarbon having from 1 to 18 carbon atoms. Illustrative of hydrocarbyl are alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, octyl, decyl, dodecyl, hexadecyl, octadecyl, and the like, including isomeric forms thereof alkenyl such as vinyl, allyl, butenyl, pentenyl, hexenyl, octenyl, decenyl, undecenyl, tridecenyl, hexadecenyl, octadecenyl, and the like, including isomeric forms thereof aralkyl such as benzyl, phenethyl, phenylpropyl, benzhydryl, naphthylmethyl, and the like aryl such as phenyl, tolyl, xylyl, naphthyl, biphenylyl, and the like cycloalkyl such as cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cyclooctyl and the like including isomer forms thereof and cycloalkenyl such as cyclopentenyl, cyclohexenyl, cycloheptenyl, cyclooctenyl, and the like, including isomeric forms thereof. The hydrocarbyl groups can be substituted by one or a plurality of substituents provided the latter are not reactive with amine groups. Illustrative of such substituents are halo, i.e., chloro, bromo, fluoro and iodo nitro alkoxy from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, inclusive, such as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy, pentyloxy, hexyloxy, heptyloxy, octyloxy and the like, including isomeric forms thereof alkylmercapto from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, inclusive, such as methylmercapto, ethylmercapto, propylmercapto, butylmercapto, pentylmercapto, hexylmercapto, heptylmercapto, octylmercapto, and the like, including isomeric forms thereof and cyano.

The preferred inert substituents are halogen with chlorine most preferred. The diamines in accordance with the present invention are useful for all the purposes set forth above for the prior art aromatic diamines but they find utility as curatives for polymer systems such as epoxy resin curatives and find particular utility as extenders in polyurethanes. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Generally speaking, the aromatic diamines in accordance with the invention are crystalline solids. Depending upon the extent and type of substitution on the aromatic ring, the diamines can range from low to high melting solids, for example, having melting points from about 80 C or lower, to a high of about 240 C or higher with values intermediate therebetween. However, some diamines are liquids or oils even when in a pure state. The aromatic diamines in accordance with the present invention are further characterized by having, for the most part, good solubility in common organic solvents such as ketones, alcohols, ethers, esters, chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents, dipolar aprotic solvents, and the like. Generally speaking, compound solubility can be increased by employing isomer mixtures of the diamines of formula I . In a surprising, and advantageous, feature of the aromatic diamines in accordance with the present invention, their reactivities as measured by their relative reactivities with phenyl isocyanate, can cover a relatively broad range depending on the type and extent of substitution on the aromatic diamine ring. In the test procedure, the subject diamine is reacted with a stoichiometric amount of phenyl isocyanate at a dilute reactant concentration level for example about 6.8 weight percent in a solvent for example dimethylacetamide at ambient room temperature about 200C under Argon and the disappearance of the isocyanate band 2250 cm 1 in the infrared is followed on aliquot samples. Illustratively, 5 a,adimethylbenzyl 2,4toluenediamine in accordance with the present invention is characterized by a reactivity approximately equal to MOCA or approximately 1 150 of 4,4 methylenebis aniline . 3,5 bis a,a dimethylbenzyl 2,6 toluenediamine in accordance with the present invention is approximately 1 3 of MOCA in reactivity. Therefore, the aromatic diamines in accordance with the present invention can provide a range of basic reactivities depending on the application in which they are being employed.

Preferred amongst the aromatic diamines set forth above are those having either the 2,4 , or 2,6 toluenediamine nucleus, and most preferred within each of those two groups are those having the a,a dimethylbenzyl substituent group on said toluenediamine nucleus. Particularly preferred are the diamine mixtures comprising a from about 70 to about 95 percent by weight of 5 a,a dimethyl benzyl 2,4 toluenediamine and b the remaining 30 to 5 percent by weight being 3 a,a dimethylbenzyl 2,6 toluenedjamine based on the combined weights of a and b . The aromatic diamnes I in accordance with the present invention are readily prepared by alkylating the appropriately substituted aromatic diamines III with an appropriate styrene compound IVa or precursor thereof discussed in detail below or an appropriate benzocycloalkene compound IVb according to the following schematic equationEMI8.1 tb SEP XI SEP SEP R3CH CR1 tb SEP IVa SEP B SEP I tb H2N SEP NH2 tb SEP lower SEP alkyl 0 SEP to SEP 2 SEP 7CnH2 SEP R rn tb SEP III SEP CM tb SEP J tb SEP R1 tb SEP IVb tb wherein X is hydrogen or hydrocarbyl, R, R1, m and n are defined as above, Rd is hydrogen or lower alkyl, CnHzn is alkylene having 1 to 4 carbon atoms similar to alkylene defined above but having the smaller carbon atom range and the alkylidene R3CH and cycloalkylidene CnHznCH of IVa and IVb become the R2 and the CnHzn respectively of the m phenylenediamines I defined above. Generally speaking, the alkylation is carried out conveniently by heating the reactants in the appropriate proportions in the presence of a catalyst until the desired compound I is formed. For typical reaction methods and conditions see the art cited supra, particularlyDS 1768697, and see also U.S. Patent 4,008,275 for typical catalysts. Optionally, an inert organic solvent may be employed such as chlorobenzene, dlchlorobenzene, nitrobenzene, and the like, and the resulting mixture or solution is brought into contact with the catalyst and the mixture stirred at the appropriate temperature. Alternatively, and in a preferred embodiment, no organic solventIs employed but rather an excess of one reactant over the other is used. The reaction of III with IVa or IVb is an equilibrium process and by using an excess of one reactant the dual purpose of a solvent effect and the shifting of the reaction equilibrium toward higher conversions 5s achieved. It will be readily understood by those skilled in the art that the choice of which reactant to use in excess to achieve the maximum yield of desired product I can readily be determined by trial and error by one skilled in the art. Advantageously, the molar proportions of IVa or IVb to diamine III can fall within the ratios of about 20 1 to 1 20, preferably about 10 1 to 1 10. In a preferred mode of preparation, the IVa or IVb is used in a molar excess over III of about 10 1 to about 5 1. Since compounds in accordance with the present invention can have two of the benzyl radicals arising from the double alkylation of the starting amine, such dialkylated products can be prepared in either a one step reaction, wherein both alkylations take place in the one procedure, or, alternatively, in a two step procedure wherein the first monoalkylated compound is formed and then alkylated in a second step to introduce the second benzyl radical. Ordinarily, the alkylation is carried out at elevated temperatures, advantageously within a range of from about 400C to about 2500C. The reaction mixture is preferably stirred with the catalyst component in any suitable reaction vessel, preferably, under an inert atmosphere such as nitrogen or argon at a temperature falling within the above range. Heating Is continued until routine analytical procedures, carried out on an aliquot, indicate that reaction is substantially complete. Illustrative of such analytical procedures are high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC to determine weight percent of components in the mixture, nuclear magnetic resonance Nmr and infrared spectroscopy, and the like. Any convenient alkylation catalyst used for aromatic amine alkylation can be employed. Typically useful are the aqueous mineral acids, clays, acid clays, diatomaceous earths, zeolites, aromatic sulfonic acids, and the like. For a discussion on such catalysts seeU.S. Patent 4,008,275 whose disclosure in respect thereof is hereby incorporated by reference. A preferred group of catalysts for the preparation of the aromatic diamines I include the natural and synthetic zeolites, and aromatic sulfonic acids. Generally speaking the catalyst is employed within a range of from about 5 weight percent to about 95 weight percent based on the combined weight of diamine and catalyst. Illustrative of the diamines III which may be employed are m phenylenediamine, 2,4 toluenediamine, 2,6 toluenediamine, 4 ethyl m phenylenediamine, 4 propyl m phenyl enedi amine, 4 butyl m phenylenediamine, 4 octyl m phenylenediamine, 5 methyl m phenylenediamine, 5 ethyl m phenylenediamine, 5 propyl m phenyl enediamine, 5 butyl m phenylenediamine, 5 octyl m phenyl enediamine, 5 methoxy m phenylenediamine, 5 al lyl m phenyl enediamine, 5 phenyl m phenylenediamine, 5 benzyl m phenylenediamine, 5 cyclohexyl m phenylenediamine, 2 ethyl m phenylenediamine, 2 butyl m phenylenediamine, 2 octyl m phenylenediamine, 6 methyl 2,4 toluenediamine, 6 ethyl 2,4 toluenediamine, 6 allyl 2,4 toluenediamine, 6 methoxy 2,4 toluenediamine, 6 phenyl 2,4 toluenediamine, 6 benzyl 2,4 toluenediamine, 6 cyclohexyl 2,4 toluenediamine, 4 methyl 2,6 toluenediamine, 4 ethyl 2,6 tol uenediamine, 4 allyl 2,6 toluenediamine, 4 methoxy 2,6 toluenediamine, 4 phenyl 2,6 toluenediamine, 4 benzyl 2,6 toluenediamine, 4 cyclohexyl 2,6 toluenediamine, and the like. Preferred starting diamines are the 2,4 and 2,6 toluenediamines.Particularly preferred are the mixtures comprising from about 60 to 85 percent by weight of 2,4 toluenediamine and 40 to 15 percent by weight being 2,6 toluenediamine. Illustrative of the styrenes which can be employed in the preparation of the compounds of the invention are styrene itself, p methylstyrene, p ethylstyrene, p propylstyrene, p butylstyrene, p amylstyrene, p hexyl styrene, p heptyl styrene, p octylstyrene, p nonylstyrene, p decylstyrene, p octadecyl styrene, p isopropylstyrene, p isobutylstyrene, p 2 ethylhexylsytrene, p isononylstyrene, p chlorosytrene, p bromostyrene, p methoxystyrene, p benzylstyrene, p phenethylstyrene, p phenylstyrene, p tolylstyrene, p allylstyrene, p cyclobutylstyrene, p cyclopentylstyrene, p cyclohexylstyrene, p cycloheptylstyrene, p cyclooctylstyrene, p 1 cyclopentyl styrene, p 1 cyclohexenyl styrene, and the like ss methylstyrene, ss ethylstyrene, ss propylstyrene, f3 butyl styrene, ss pentylstyrene, ss hexylstyrene, ss heptylstyrene, ss methyl 2,4 dimethylstyrene, and the like a methyl styrene, a ethyl B methylstyrene, alpha methyl ss ethylstyrene, indene, benzocyclohexane 1, benzocycloheptane 1, benzocyclooctene 1, 1 methyl indene, a methyl p chlorostyrene, alpha methyl p bromostyrene, alpha methyl p tolylstyrene, a methy7 p ethylstyrene, alpha methyl p butylstyrene, alpha methyl p benzylstyrene, a methyi p allylstyrene, alpha methyl p cyclopentylstyrene, and the like. In addition to employing the styrenes per se in the preparation of aromatic diamines in accordance with the present invention it is possible to form said compounds in situ by introducing a precursor of any of said compounds which will generate the styrene under the conditions prevailing in the reaction mixture. For example, dimers, trimers, and higher oligomeric forms which will revert to the styrenes under the elevated temperatures and acid conditions of the above described preparation of I can be employed therein. Further, the various aryl substituted carbinols such as phenylisopropyl alcohol which on dehydration will provide the appropriate styrene compound can be employed to prepare the compounds of formula I . The starting aromatic diamines and styrenes are well known in the art as are the carbinols or oligomeric styrene materials. As set forth above, the substituted aromatic amines of the invention find particular utility as extenders for the preparation of polyurethane polyureas. The polyurethane polyurea polymers extended by the diamines having formula I can be formed as cellular, microcellular, or solid polyurethane polyurea polymers using any of the prior art methods known to those skilled in the art seePolyurethanes Chemistry and Technology II, by J. H. Saunders and K.C. Frisch, 1964, Interscience Publishers, New York, N.Y., for teaching of the preparation of polyurethanes. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the polyurethane polyurea polymers employing the diamines I as extenders are prepared as molded materials, particularly reaction injection molded polyurethane polyureas for typical lists of reactants and procedures which can be used in combination with the diamines I to produce the polyurethanes polyureas see U.S. Patent 4,296,212 whose disclosure is Incorporated by reference herein. The following examples describe the manner and process of making and using the Invention and set forth the best mode contemplated by the Inventors of carrying out the invention but are not to be construed as limiting.Example 1 A 100 ml. reaction flask was equipped with a stirrer, thermometer, and reflux condenser. The flask was charged with 29.5 g. 0.25 mole of methylstyrene, 6.48 g. 0.06 mole of m phenylene dlamine, 7.24 g. 0.04 mole of m phenylenediamine dihydrochloride, and 20 ml. of water. The mixture was heated at reflux at 95 100 C for 24 hours. The solution was allowed to cool and mixed with 140 ml. of 1.0 N hydrochloric acid. The aqueous solution was washed in a separatory funnel 3X with 50 ml. portions each of methylene chloride in order to remove the excess a methylstyrene. The resulting aqueous fraction was made slightly basic by the addition of the appropriate amount of 10 N sodium hydroxide. An oil separated which was extracted with 2X 40 ml.portions each of methylene chloride. The combined methylene chloride fractions were washed with 3X 50 ml. portions each of warm water to remove unreacted phenylene diamine.Concentration of the organic layer in vacuum resulted in a solid residue. Vacuum distillation of this residue provided a pale yellow distillate, b.p. 168 176 C 0.05 mm pressure of mercury wt. 7.8 g. 62 of 4 a,a dimethylbenzyl 1,3 phenylene diamine having the following formulaEMI14.1 in accordance with the present invention. The distillate solidified on standing at room temperature and was recrystallized from toluene to afford colorless crystals, m.p. 83 83.5 C. Nuclear magnetic resonance Nmr confirmed the structure along with the following elemental analysis. Calcd. for C15H1N2 C, 79.60X, H, 8.022 N, 12.38 Found C, 79.63 H, 8.10 N, 12.42 . High pressure liquid chromatography HPLC of the original solid residue product prior to vacuum distillation showed the presence of a small amount of a dibenzylated product which product was later prepared in a separate experiment described below.Example 2 A 250 ml. reaction flask equipped with a stirrer, thermometer, reflux condenser and gas outlet tube which was connected to a receiving flask cooled by a cold water bath was charged with 70.8 g. 0.6 mole of a methylstyrene, 10.8 g. 0.1 mole of m phenylene diamine, and 10 g. Zeolite XZ 25 100 150 mesh untreated supplied byW. R. Grace Chemical Co., Baltimore, Maryland . Under a slow stream of nitrogen and with rapid stirring, the flask contents were heated. Initially, a small amount of water from the Zeolite was co distilled from the flask with some a methylstyrene and was collected in the receiving flask. Following this, the nitrogen flow was stopped and the mixture was heated at about 1650C for 24 hours. The reaction mixture while still hot was filtered by pouring it through a heated Buchner funnel to remove the Zeolite. Upon cooling to room temperature, a crystalline precipitate separated from the filtrate. The precipitate was collected by suction filtration to provide 17.2 g. of a mixture of predominantly the dibenzylated product 4,6 bis , dimethylbenzyl 1,3 phenylene diamine in accordance withEMI15.1 the present invention and a minor amount of the monobenzylated diamine described in Example 1. Pure dibenzylated product was obtained as colorless crystals by recrystallizing the crude crystalline material twice from toluene.Additional product was isolated by washing the Zeolite catalyst several times with methylene dlchloride, combining the methylene dlchloride washings with the first filtrate from the reaction mixture and removing the solvent and unreacted a methylstyrene by distillation to provide a residue, and, finally, treatment with chloroform. Total yield of the isolated dibenzyl product was 58g m.p. 236 2370C insoluble in ethanol, acetone, ethylene glycol, soluble in methylene dichloride, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether diglyme , and hot toluene Nmr confirmed the structure along with the following analysis. Calcd. for C24H28N C, 83.67 H, 8.19 N, 8.13 Found C, 83.28 H, 8.37 N, 8.14 .
