# Process for producing powder metal composition.

## Abstract
A process for producing a powder part involves the step of compacting a powder metal composition sub stantially comprising 1.0 2.5 Ni, 0.3 0.7 Mo, 0.15 0.30 Mn, 0.3 0.7 C, and 0.5 1.0 zinc stearate, the balance being Fe and is characterised in that the com position additionally comprises substantially 0.5 to 1.5 Cu and in that the compressed part is sintered at a temperature ranging from about 2000 F 1093 C to about 2150 F 1177 C for about 15 to about 30 minutes in a furnace having a dew point ranging from about 20 F 6.7 C to about 61 F 16 C and under an endothermic atmosphere.
