# Video recording and reproducing apparatus.

## Abstract
A video recording and reproducing apparatus comprises a line sensor camera having a line scan image sensor which is scanned along a predetermined standard line and receives an image of a moving object passing the standard line. An output video signal of the line sensor camera is converted by an A D converter into a series of picture element data which are successively stored into a video memory to form therein a plurality of pictures. A control circuit selects in accordance with selection information supplied from a control box a de sired one of the plurality of stored pictures, and reads the picture element data of the desired picture from the video memory. The picture element data thus read from the video memory are successively converted into analog video signals which are supplied through a mixing circuit to a display unit to thereby display the picture on the display unit.
