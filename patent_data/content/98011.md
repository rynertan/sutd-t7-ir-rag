## Abstract
The invention relates to a key keeper comprising a key retaining loop 3 with an opening 17 for the receipt of keys, said loop is connected to a loop holder 2 being slideably mounted within a housing 1. The loop is being closed if the holder is in its slid in position, whereas the loop can be opened if the holder is partially slid out of the housing. Means are further provided for locking the holder in its slid in position. The means for locking the holder consist of a wheel 4, which is rotatably mounted in the housing, the rotation of which can be prevented by a snap connection 11. By rotating the wheel 4, the loop holder is displaced in or out of the housing 1.
