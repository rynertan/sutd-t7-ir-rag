# Ignition system for internal combustion engines.

## Abstract
A ignition system for an internal combustion engine is dis closed. The ignition system includes a timing signal detector 2 responsive to the rotation speed of an engine to generate a pulse signal Ig including a leading edge and a trailing edge corresponding to the ignition timing and having a predeter mined duty cycle, a triangular wave generator 31 for gener ating a triangular wave voltage V
