# Semiconductor memory device.

## Abstract
A semiconductor memory device comprising a semi conductor substrate of one conductivity type, memory cells each including a semiconductor impurity region 14 of a conductivity type opposite to that of the substrate formed in the semiconductor substrate, a charge storage portion 18 formed in the semiconductor substrate, and a gate portion 13 to form a channel in the semiconductor sub strate between the semiconductor impurity region and the charge storage portion, and a metal conductive layer 15 . In order to reduce soft errors of the memory device caused by alpha particles from package materials, the metal con ductive layer 15 overlaying the charge storage portion is formed so as to have a width greater than the minimum width used in an integrated circuit at a portion thereof overlaying the substantial part of the charge storage por tion.
