# Composite of metal bonded cubic boron nitride and a substrate and process of preparation.

## Abstract
There is provided a process for simultaneously 1 cementing particles of cubic boron nitride CBN together, 2 bonding particles of ceramic together to form a substrate, or support layer, for the cemented CBN particles, and 3 bonding the cemented CBN particles to the substract in which the cementing medium for the CBN particles and the ceramic substrate are both derived from a single multi component source comprising a mixture of ceramic particles and particles of an aluminium atom yielding material.
