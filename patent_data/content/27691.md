## Description
VINYL CHLORIDE POLYMERISATION PROCESS The present invention relates to a process for the polymerisation of vinyl chloride in aqueous suspension. When vinyl chloride is homo or copolymerised in aqueous suspension in a reactor it is well known that a problem arises in that surfaces inside the reactor become coated with tenaciously adhering polymeric material known as build up. The formation of tenaciously adhering buildup is undesirable from the point of view of achieving efficient heat transfer for cooling and heating the reactor contents, effective usage of monomer, effective control and monitoring of the polymerisation reaction, and acceptable polymer quality in view of contamination by dislodged particles of the build up . Because of the problems in respect of heat transfer, polymerisation control and polymer quality, it is necessary to clean the reactor between each polymerisation cycle wherein the deposited material is removed as completely as possible, e.g by scraping or chipping by hand, solvent cleaning or pressure washing. This is wasteful in terms of the expense of the equipment and manpower required to carry out such cleaning and also in terms of the loss of productivity for a given reactor arising from.the time taken to effect the cleaning operation. Hand cleaning is additionally undesirable in that it may constitute a health hazard to the cleaner in view of the harmful properties of vinyl chloride.Indeed, opening up the reactor between polymerisation cycles for cleaning is itself undesirable in this respect since it releases residual vinyl chloride in the reactor to the surrounding atmosphere. It has been proposed in British Patent 1 439 339 to coat the internal surfaces of a reactor used for vinyl chloride polymerisation in aqueous suspension with, inter alia, a cross linked product formed by reacting formaldelyde and a phenol in order to prevent or reduce the formation of build up therein without reducing the polymerisation rate. However, according to JapanesePatent Publication 54 107991, the coating product described in British Patent 1 439 339 is not very effective in preventing build up, apparently because the phenol formaldehyde condensate is highly cross linked.InBritish Patent 1 439 339, the exemplified phenol formaldehyde condensate is prepared using a reaction sequence which employs, inter alia, an acidcatalysed condensation between phenol and formaldehyde and which involves heating the polymeric material applied to the reactor surface at an elevated temperature before changing the polymerisation ingredients. In Japanese Patent Publication 54 107991 an improvement over the technique described in British Patent 1 439 339 is proposed whereby the build up suppressant applied to the reactor internal surfaces is an early stage phenol formaldehyde condensate. The preferred early stage condensate is a resol, obtained using an alkaline catalyst, and conveniently applied as a basic aqueous solution. After applying the solution of the early stage condensate, it is preferable to rinse the coated surface with water or with dilute acid pH 6 . There is no limitation mentioned concerning the polymerisation initiator and those exemplified are t butyl peroxypivalate, 2,2 azobis 2,4 dimethylvaleronitrile and lauroyl peroxide. It is said in Japanese Patent Publication 54 107991 that the resol employed is prepared using an excess of formaldehyde relative to the phenol and all the Examples according to the claimed invention use a molar ratio of phenol formaldehyde of 1 1.6. We have discovered, however, that in the case of vinyl chloride polymerisation in aqueous suspension using a dialkyl peroxydicarbonate as initiator, a molar ratio such as that described inJapanese Patent Publication 54 107991 does not result in effective build up suppression. Indeed, we have found that when carrying out vinyl chloride polymerisation in aqueous suspension using a dialkyl peroxydicarbonate as initiator, it is necessary to contain the molar ratio of phenol to formaldehyde within a certain narrow range if effective build up suppression without retardation of the polymerisation reaction is to be achieved. According to the present invention there is provided a process for the polymerisation of vinyl chloride in aqueous suspension using a free radical yielding initiator wherein the polymerisation is carried out in a polymerisation reactor having adherently deposited on internal surfaces thereof a build up suppressant coating which has been formed, prior to changing the ingredients for the polymerisation, by 1 applying a basic aqueous solution of a resol, which resol is made by condensing a phenol and formaldehyde in a base catalysted reaction, to the reactor internal surfaces and 2 insolubilising the resol by applying water or an acid to the basic solution on the internal surfaces, characterised in that the molar ratio between the phenol and formaldehyde used in the preparation of the resol is within the range 1.0 1.1 to 1.1 1.0 and in that the polymerisation is effected using as initiator a dialkyl peroxydicarbonate whose alkyl radicals contain up to 20 carbon atoms. The resol used for the preparation of the coating should be prepared by condensing the phenol and formaldehyde in the presence of a base. The use of an acid catalyst will yield a novolak product in our experience such products are usually difficult to prepare and handle and so are not used for the process of the present invention. The ratio between the phenol and formaldehyde should be within the range 1.0 1.1 to 1.1 1.0. The use of a smaller amount of phenol than that required to give a phenol formaldehyde ratio of 1.0 1.1 incurs the production of a coating with reduced build up suppressant activity.The use of a larger amount of phenol than that required to give a phenol formaldehyde ratio of 1.1 1.0 incurs the production of a coating which unacceptably inhibits the vinyl chloride polymerisation reaction. The coating of the invention is prepared by first preparing a basic solution of the resol, which will normally be the direct or diluted product from the basecatalysed reaction to form the resol the basic catalyst being e.g. aq. KOH, aq. NaOH, aq. ammonia, or an amine , applying this solution to internal surfaces of the reactor e.g. by spraying, painting or flooding and then applying water or a dilute aqueous acid to the basic solution e.g.by spraying or flooding to insolubilise the resol. It is our belief that the action of water or dilute acid causes a degree of cross linking in the resol thereby rendering the phenol formaldehyde condensate insoluble. However the text of Japanese Patent Publication 54 107991 implies that significant cross linking only occurs if the resol applied to the reactor surface is heated at an elevated temperature and that this extensive cross linking destroys the build up suppressant activity of the applied coating. Many basic resol solutions are quite stable unless treated under cross linking conditions and may be stored for a long period of time e.g several months without significant deterioration others however may cross link quickly and may have a short shelf life which may however be prolonged e.g by storage at a low temperature and or by the presence of a suitable stabiliser system . By the term phenol in this specification is meant monohydric and polyhydric phenols such as phenol itself, catechol, hydroquinone, resorcinol, chlororesorcinol, the isomeric hydroxy benzoic acids, the isomeric dihydroxy toluenes and xylenes, the isomeric ethyl, propyl, butyl and pentyl dihydroxy benzenes, pyrogallol, hydroxyquinol, phloroglucinol, the isomeric trihydroxy toluenes and xylenes and the isomeric ethyl, propyl, butyl and pentyl trihydroxy benzenes. The coating may be formed on any surface inside the reactor which is liable to suffer the formation of buildup thereon. For example, it may be formed on the interior surface of the main body of the reactor, and on the interior surface of the roof of the reactor which is often above the liquid level of the polymerisation medium and usually suffers tenacious build up thereon. If a condenser is installed in a part of the reactor that is in contact with the gaseous phase during polymerisation or if it is installed outside the reactor and connected thereto by conduit piping, the consenser and conduit piping may be similarly coated. It is to be appreciated that for the best results, a surface to be coated should be as clean and as smooth as possible to begin with. If the surface is of somewhat dubious quality in this respect, it may be advisable to coat it with two or more successively applied layers of the coating. The coating may be formed on a surface in combination with one or more other materials, e.g materials which also haves suppressing effect on polymerisation build up. A reactor having coated internal surfaces according to the invention may be used for the polymerisation of vinyl chloride as defined wherein the formation of buildup is eliminated or very much suppressed without unacceptable retardation of the polymerisation reaction.The polymerisation reaction may if desired be carried out in the presence of a basic substance such as NaHC03 or a suitable buffering system to ensure an adequately high pH for the reaction medium e.g. pH 4 as such an expedient can further enhance the build up suppressant effect of the coating product. By polymerisation of vinyl chloride is meant both homopolymerisation of vinyl chloride and copolymerisation with one or more comonomers copolymerisable therewith.Examples of comonomers include vinyl esters such as vinyl acetate, acrylic esters such as methyl acrylate and butyl methacrylate, acrylic nitriles such as acrylonitrile and methacrylonitrile, unsaturated diesters such as diethyl maleate, allyl esters such as allyl acetate, a olefines such as ethylene and propylene, vinyl ethers and styrene compounds. It is preferred to apply the invention to the production of polymers containing at least 50 molar and more particularly at least 80 molar, of units derived from vinyl chloride. The invention is particularly applicable to the production of vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymers containing 3 to 20 molar of vinyl acetate units, since it is in any case often extremely difficult when using known build up suppressants to obtain a consistently build up free process when making such copolymers. Examples of dialkyl peroxydicarbonates whose alkyl radicals contain up to 20 carbon atoms the term alkyl including cycloalkyl which may be used in the present invention include diethyl peroxydicarbonate, diisopropyl peroxydicarbonate, dicetyl peroxydicarbonate, and bis 4 tertiarybutylcyclohexyl peroxydicarbonate. Diethyl peroxydicarbonate is particularly preferred. The initiator may be used in a conventional quantity in the polymerisation reaction. The operating conditions for polymerisation according to the present invention may be those customarily used for vinyl chloride polymerisation, the polymerisation temperature generally being between 40 and 750C and the pressure generally being below 15 kg cm2. The present invention is now illustrated by the following Examples. Unless otherwise specified all parts and percentages are by weight. In all Examples employing a polymerisation reactor, the reactor internal surfaces were thoroughly cleaned before being used as described in any particular Example. EXAMPLE 1 A resol for use in the preparation of a build up suppressant coating according to the invention was produced as follows. Phenol 94g, as a 92 w v aqueous solution 1.0 mole and formaldelyde 30g, as a 38 w v aqueous solution 1.0 mole and 4M Na OH aqueous solution about 18ml were placed in a flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a thermometer. The mixture was heated gently to 60 700C and allowed to boil for several minutes under its own exothemicity the mixture was then refluxed gently with applied heating for about 30 minutes. The product was a slightly viscous basic solution containing the resol it had a shelf life of several months. EXAMPLES 2 4 Resols were prepared using substantially the same procedure as in Example 1 but employing different phenols, viz p hydroxy benzoic acid Example 2 , resorcinol Example 3 and 4 chlororesorcinol Example 4 , the molar ratio to formaldelyde in each case again being 1.0 1.0.The reflux time in Example 2 was about 3 hours the long reflux time being necessary because of the deactivated phenolic ring while the reaction to form the resol inExamples 3 and 4 was effected by admixture at room temperature the low temperature being due to the activated phenolic ring . The shelf life of the product from Example 2 was several months the shelf lives of the products from Examples 3 and 4 were about 24 hours, although dilution with further Na OH solution 1 2 increased these to about 2 days, or at least a week if storage was at OOC. EXAMPLE 5 The internal surfaces made of stainless steel of a polymerisation reactor capacity about 35 litres were painted with the basic resol solution of Example 1 and the painted surfaces sprayed with water. The resol rapidly reacted to form an insoluble glaze on the reactor internal surfaces. A vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymerisation 100 parts vinyl chloride, 11 parts vinyl acetate charged was carried out in the reactor in aqueous suspension 198 parts water charged using partially hydrolysed polyvinyl acetate as suspension agent 0.348 based on the weight of vinyl chloride and diethyl peroxydicarbonate as initiator 0.07 based on the weight of vinyl chloride . The polymerisation temperature was 580C. The polymerisation was terminated when the pressure in the reactor had dropped to about half of running pressure by venting and discharging the polymer slurry.The internal surfaces of the reactor were inspected seeTable 1 . EXAMPLES 6 8 The procedure of Example 5 was followed in Examples 6 8 but using the basic resol solutions from Example 2 in Example 6 , Example 3 in Example 7 and Example 4 in Example 8 . EXAMPLE 9 The procedure of Example 5 was followed except that the application of the resol solution was ommitted. The details of the polymerisations of Examples 5 9, together with the observations regarding build up, are shown in Table 1.

EXAMPLES 10 13 Resols were prepared from phenol and formaldehyde using substantially the same procedure as in Example 1 except that the amounts of phenol and formaldehyde were adjusted to provide molar ratios of respectively 1.2 1.0 in Example 10 , 1.1 1.0 in Example 11 , 1.0 1.1 inExample 12 , and 1.0 1.6 in Example 13 . EXAMPLES 14 AND 15 Resols were prepared from 4 chlororesorcinol and formaldehyde using substantially the same procedure as inExample 4 except that the amounts of 4 chlororesorcinol and formaldehyde were adjusted to provide molar ratios of respectively 1.1 1.0 in Example 14 and 1.0 1.1 inExample 15 . EXAMPLES 16 21 Vinyl chloride vinyl acetate copolymerisations were carried out in Examples 16 21 following the procedure ofExample 5 but using the basic resol solutions from Example 10 in Example 16 , Example 11 in Example 17 , Example 12 in Example 18 , Example 13 in Example 19 , Example 14 in Example 20 , and Example 15 in Example 21 .

No pressure drop was observed after 8 hours at which time the polymerisation was terminated. It can be seen from Table 2 that a phenol formaldehyde ratio of 1.0 1.1 is about the limit for effective build up suppress ion, while a phenol formaldehyde ratio of 1.1 1.0 is about the limit for acceptable reaction time. It will be noted from theExamples of Japanese Patent Publication 54 107991 that vinyl chloride homo and copolymerisations employing a phenol formaldehyde resol condensate of molar ratio 1.0 1.6 as the coating material and t butyl peroxypivalate, 2,2 azobis 2,4 dimethylvaleronitrile and lauroyl peroxide as initiators did not incur significant build up formation. EXAMPLES 22, 23 Vinyl chlorde vinyl acetate copolymerisations were carried out in Examples 22 and 23 following the procedure of Example 5 except that the copolymerisations employed, as initiator, lauroyl peroxide 0.17 based on the weight of vinyl chloride in Example 22 and dicetyl peroxydicarbonate 0.10 based on the weight of vinyl chloride in Example 23, and that both Examples used the basic resol solution from Example 13 phenol formaldehyde condensate of molar ratio 1.0 1.6 . EXAMPLE 24 The procedure of Example 23 was employed i.e. using dicetyl peroxydicarbonate as the polymerisation initiator except that the basic resol solution from Example 1 was used phenol formaldehyde condensate of molar ratio 1.0 1.0 .

However a phenol formaldehyde molar ratio of 1.0 1.6, when using dicetyl peroxydicarbonate as initiator Example 23 , resulted in unacceptable build up formation. By contrast, the use of a phenol formaldehyde molar ratio of 1.0 1.0 gave effective build up suppression. EXAMPLES 25 30 In these Examples vinyl chloride homopolymerisations were carried out in the reactor used for Example 5, the reactor being coated with the resol solution fromExample 1 in Examples 26 and 28 and from Example 13 inExamples 25 and 27, with resol coating being omitted inExamples 29 and 30. The vinyl chloride homopolymerisations employed 100 parts of vinyl chloride, 245 parts of water, partially hydrolysed polyvinyl acetate as suspension agent 0.34 based on the weight of vinyl chloride and, as initiator, diethyl peroxydicarbonate in Examples 25, 26 and 29 0.11 based on the weight of vinyl chloride and dicetyl peroxydicarbonate in Examples 26, 27 and 30 0.10 based on the weight of vinyl chloride . The polymerisation temperature in each case was 58 C. Each polymerisation was terminated when the pressure in the reactor had dropped to about half of running pressure by venting and discharging the polymer slurry.
