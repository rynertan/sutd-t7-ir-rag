## Description
COMPOSITION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Multilayer compositions have been utilized for many years. The concept of a multilayer is that the positive properties of two or more materials are combined with the structural integrity of each material being essentially uncompromised. Usually the positive properties of one material off set or counter balance the weaker properties of the second material. For example, among the positive properties of polycarbonate are high heat resistance and impact strength. However polycarbonate has a relatively high transmission rate for certain gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide for example.Polyvinyl chloride does not have very high resistance to impact or heat but has excellent resistance to the transmission of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Therefore a multilayer composition utilizing polycarbonate adjacent to polyvinylchloride can be employed in structures wherein the properties of high impact resistance, high heat resistance and high resistance to oxygen and carbon dioxide transmission are necessary. Although many of these multilayer compositions can be hypothesized on the basis of laminating a material possessing certain strong properties with a material having weaknesses in those same property areas, certain practical considerations inhibit successful implementation of this theory. The two materials are in intimate contact at their interface. This juncture or interface should provide a sufficiently strong interaction with respect to the processing conditions which the multilayer structure undergoes that a tight, firm bond is maintained. Such conditions to which the multilayer can be exposed include heat, pressure, humidity, liquid chemicals, gases and the like or various combinations of these conditions. The propensity of the two layers to maintain this tight, firm bond is generally known as the compatibility of the two layers.When the two materials are incompatible, the utility of the multilayer structure is severely inhibited or useless. In order to bind two relatively incompatible layers, a tie layer is generally employed joining the two incompatible layers by tieing them together. This tie layer usually enjoys good compatibility with both incompatible layers and is aligned between the two incompatible layers. Aromatic polycarbonate is a particularly useful material for multi layer technology because of its high heat and impact resistance. However, it is incompatible to a varying degree with a number of other resins.Of particular concern is its incompatibility with olefin containing resins. A novel tie material has been developed. This tie material is particularly effective for tieing aromatic polycarbonate with oleo in containing polymers. This tie layer provides a multilayer structure which has increased hydrolytic stability. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the invention there is a multilayer structure comprising an outer layer of aromatic polycarbonate and an outer layer of a polymer prepared from an olefinic monomer, said outer layers tied together with a layer comprising an oleo in acrylate copolymer. Further accordance with the invention there is a novel composition of matter which comprises an admixture of an oleo in acrylate and a poly 4 methylpentene l . In further accordance with the invention is a multilayer structure comprising an outer layer of aromatic polycarbonate and an outer layer of a polymer prepared from an olefinic monomer, said outer layers tied together with a layer comprising an admixture of an oleo in acrylate polymer and a poly 4 methylpentene l , the oleo in acrylate and poly 4 methylpentene l in such quantities that the adhesive strength and clarity of the tie layer is not significantly reduced after exposure to hydrolytic conditions at elevated temperatures. A further aspect of the invention is a composition comprising a blend of a a major amount of an aromatic polycarbonate and a polyolefin and b a minor amount of an oleo in acrylate polymer and poly 4 methylpentene l . Aromatic polycarbonates are prepared in the conventional manner by reacting a dihydric phenol with a carbonate precursor in an interfacial polymerization process or transesterification. Typical of some of the dihydric phenols that may be employed in the practice of this invention are 2,2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl propane bisphenol A , 2,2 bis 4 hydroxy 3 methylphenyl propane, 4,4 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl heptane, 2 2 3,5,3 ,5 tetrachloro 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl propane, 2,2 3,5, 3 ,5 tetrabromo 4,4 dihydroxydiphenyl propane, 3,3 dichloro 4,4 dihydroxyphenyl methane, bis 4 hydroxy phenyl sulfone and bis 4 hydroxy phenyl sulfide. Other dihydric phenols of the bisphenol type are also available and are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,999,835 3,028,365 and 3,334,154. Bisphenol A is preferred. It is, of course, possible to employ two or more different dihydric phenols or a copolymer of a dihydric phenol with a glycol or with hydroxy or acid terminated polyester, or with a dibasic acid in the event a car bonate copolymer or interpolymer rather than a homopolymer is desired for use in the preparation of the aromatic carbonate polymers of this invention. Also employed in the practice of this invention may be blends of any of the above materials to provide the aromatic carbonate polymer. The carbonate precursor may be either a carbonyl halide, a carbonate ester or a haloformate. The carbonyl halides which can be employed herein are carbonyl bromide, carbonyl chloride and mixtures thereof. Typical of the carbonate esters which may be employed herein are diphenyl carbonate, di halophenyl carbonates such as di chlorophenyl carbonate, di bromophenyl carbonate, di trichlorophenyl carbonate, di tribromophenyl carbonate, etc., di alkylphenyl carbonate such as di tolyl carbonate etc., di naphthyl carbonate, di chloronaphthyl carbonate, phenyl tolyl carbonate, chlorophenyl chloronaphthyl carbonate, etc., or mixtures thereof. The haloformates suitable for use herein include bis haloformates of dihydric phenols bis chloroformates of hydroquinone , or glycols bishaloformates of ethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, polyethylene glycol, etc. . While other carbonate precursors will occur to those skilled in the art, carbonyl chloride, also known as phosgene, is preferred. The aromatic polycarbonates of this invention may be prepared by employing a molecular weight regulator, an acid acceptor and a catalyst. The molecular weight regulators which can be employed in carrying out the process of this invention include monohydric phenols such as phenol, chroman I, paratertiarybutylphenol, parabromophenol, primary and secondary amines, etc. A suitable acid acceptor may be either an organic or an inorganic acid acceptor. A suitable organic acid acceptor is a tertiary amine and includes such mate rials as pyridine, triethylamine, dimethylaniline, tributylamine, etc. The inorganic acid acceptor may be one which can be either a hydroxide, a carbonate, a bicarbonate, or a phosphate or an alkali or alkaline earth metal. The catalysts which are employed herein can be any of the suitable catalysts that aid the polymerization of bisphenol A with phosgene. Suitable catalysts include tertiary amines such as, for example, triethylamine, tripropylamine, N,N dimethylaniline, quaternary ammonium compounds such as, for example, tetraethylammonium bromide, cetyl triethyl ammonium bromide, tetra n heptyl ammonium iodide, tetra n propyl ammonium bromide, tetramethylammonium chloride, tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide, tetra n butylammonium iodide, benzyltrimethylammonium chloride and quaternary phosphonium compounds such as, for example, n butyltriphenyl phosphonium bromide and methyltriphenyl phosphonium bromide. Also included herein are branched polymers wherein a polyfunctional aromatic compound is reacted with the dihydric phenol and carbonate precursor to provide a thermoplastic randomly branched polycarbonate polymer. These polyfunctional aromatic compounds contain at least three functional groups which are carboxyl, carboxylic anhydride, haloformyl, hydroxyl polyfunctional phenols or mixtures thereof. Examples of these polyfunctional aromatic compounds which may be employed in the practice of this invention include trimellitic anhydride, trimellitic acid, trimellityl trichloride, 4 chloroformyl phthalic anhydride, pyromellitic acid, pyromellitic dianhydride, mellitic acid, mellitic anhydride, trimesic acid, benzophenonetetracarboxylic acid, benzophenonetetracarboxylic anhydride and the like. The preferred polyfunctional aromatic compounds are trimellitic anhydride or trimellitic acid, or their haloformyl derivatives. Also, included herein are blends of a linear polymer and a branched polymer. Within the definition of aromatic polycarbonates are also copolyestercarbonates, that is the polymer made from a dihydric phenol, a dibasic acid and a phosgene precursor. U.S. Patent 3,169,121 covering copoly estercarbonates and methods of preparing them is hereby incorporated by reference. The other outer layer in the multi layer structure is a polyolefin. Typical of the polyolefins are polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutylene, polyisobutylene or any of the oleo in monomers having from two to about ten carbon atoms, preferably from two to about eight carbon atoms. Copolymers of the above may be employed, and are included within the term polyolefin. Examples of copolymers include copolymers of ethylene and propylene or ethylene and butene. The term copolymers includes the usual copolymers, that is, random, randomblock and block copolymers. Various densities of polyolefines can be employed in this invention and include high density polyethylene, linear low density polyethylene and low density polyethylene. The preferred poly oleo in is polypropylene.It is preferred that the polyolefin not be poly 4 methylpentene l when a blend of the oleo in acrylate and poly 4 methylpentene l is used as the tie layer. The internal tie layer joining together the aromatic polycarbonate and the polyolefin outer layers comprises an oleo in acrylate copolymer. A preferred embodiment for increased hydrolytic stability is an admixture of an oleo in acrylate copolymer and poly 4 methylpentene l . The oleo in concentration in the oleo in acrylate is generally from about 90 to about 60 weight percent, preferably from about 70 to about 85 weight percent. The oleo in employed is any of the olefines previously mentioned for the polyolefin. However an oleo in of from two to about four carbon atoms is preferred. Ethylene is the most preferred olef in. The acrylate has an alkyl or cycloalkyl ester group.The alkyl is normal or branched and is generally from one to six carbon atoms, inclusive. Examples of alkyl include methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, tertiary butyl, neopentyl and n hexyl. Normal alkyl groups are preferred.Generally, cycloalkyl groups of from four to six carbon atoms, inclusive can be employed and include cyclobutyl cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. Preferred acrylate are methacrylate and ethylacrylate. The poly 4 methylpentene l is commercially available and is made by art known techniques. In the preferred embodiment proportion of oleo in acrylate to poly 4 methylpentene l can vary significantly and still retain the excellent resistance to hydrolytic conditions and clarity which characterize the tie layer. Generally, oleo in acrylate to poly 4 methylpentene l weight ratio of from about 95 5 to about 65 35, preferably of from about 92 8 to about 70 30 provide very good hydrolytic stability to the multilayer structure. All oleo in acrylate provides good adhesion strength initially but shows hydrolytic instability. Additionally, clarity of the material after exposure to hydrolytic conditions at high temperature is reduced. All poly 4 methylpentene l does not provide acceptable adhesion between layers. The particular preferred tie layers employed in this invention are unique in that the adhesive strength of the tie layer is not significantly reduced after exposure to hydrolytic conditions at elevated temperatures. Clarity also remains essentially the same or is only minimally reduced. Standard tie layers show a significant reduction in adhesive strength. The test of a T pull on an Instron measuring device is considered to be the standard for this invention. Hydrolytic conditions at elevated temperature for this invention are autoclaving at 1210C for a period of 30 minutes or even higher temperature to provide a more stressful test. A significant reduction in adhesive strength is a reduction of about 50 or greater of the originalT pull value. The multi layer structures can be readily prepared by standard techniques, including co extrusion through a feedblock or combination in the die. The thickness of the layers may vary substantially and are obviously somewhat dependent upon the final use to which the multi layer structure will bé applied. Generally from about 0.25 mil to about 60 mil thickness of each outer layer can be employed. The layers, however, are preferably from about 0.5 to 30 mil. The tie layer is usually significantly thinner than the outer layer. Normally the tie layer will be thinner than 1 mil. Tie layers of up to 5 mil can also be employed. With reference to the outer layer, it need not be the final outer layer of the structure. It is only outer with respect to the tie layer. Each of the aromatic polycarbonate and polyolefin layers may also be adjacent to layers of other polymers or even a thin metal strip. The multi layer structure may comprise a simple laminate useful, for example, as a tray or can be thermoformed or blow molded into a variety of structures including containers of various types. In preparing laminates or containers of the invention, there can be significant wasteage of the multilayer material. An example of such material is the scrap material prepared when the pinch off is made in co extrusion blow molding. A further example of such material is containers of the multilayer material which have outlived their usefulness. These multilayer scrap materials are reground thus forming a blend of their components. The outer layers, i.e. the polycarbonate and the polyolefin are a major weight percent of the blend, generally above about 70 weight percent, preferably above about 85 weight percent of the blend. The preferred tie layer will be a minor amount of the blend.In the reground materials of this invention, the admixture of oleo in acrylate and poly 4 methylpentene l is a minor amount of the reground composition, the aromatic polycarbonate and polyolefin forming the major quantity. Generally the minor quantity of the composition will be present in such quantities that if it were a tie layer between the two components of the major quantity, the adhesive strength and clarity of the tie layer would not be significantly reduced after exposure to hydrolytic conditions at elevated temperature. A major weight quantity of the b component of the blend is the oleo in acrylate, generally from about 65 95 weight percent, preferably from about 70 to about 92 weight percent.Obviously all the other definitions within the specification apply equally as well to the aromatic polycarbonate, polyolefin, oleo in acrylate and poly 4methylpentene 1 . The blend can be injection molded into various parts and utilized wherein an aromatic polycarbonate can be employed. A molded article with greater environmental stress resistance resistance to gasoline as well as easier processability in preparation is formed. Below are examples of the invention. They are intended to exemplify the broad nature of the invention rather than be restrictive of the broad concept. Samples for Instron testing were prepared by cutting 1 inch by 8 inch strips from 4 mil film made on the 1.5 inch single screw extruder under the following conditions.

Some samples were tested on theInstron in the T pull test. Other samples were autoclaved for a period of 30 minutes at 1210C prior to T pull testing. Below are the resultsCONTROL 1 This control was designed to show the degree of adhesion between two bisphenol A polycarbonate layers with an EEA ethylene ethylacrylate TPX poly 4methylpentene 1 tie layer.

EEA or is higher, as much as 50 higher or more, see 80 20 tie layer composition. While this increase has occurred, which is contrary to the trend in Control 1, the retention of the adhesiveness after autoclaving also remains high, as high as 95 or more of the original adhesiveness, see 80 20 tie layer composition.Additionally many of the autoclaved compositions show adhesiveness which is essentially the same, less than 20 loss, as the original non autoclaved 100 EEA. All the autoclaved samples adhesiveness in the preferredEEA TPX range have greater values than the autoclaved 100 EEA.
