# Monomode optical transmission fibre having a tapered end portion provided with a lens, and method of manufacturing such a fibre.

## Abstract
A monomode optical transmission fibre 1 is de scribed, having a tapered end portion 5 on which a lens 10 is arranged. This lens is obtained by immersing the fibre end in a transparent liquid material 7 whose melting temperature is lower than that of the fibre materials and whose refractive index is substantially equal to that of the fibre core 2 , and by allowing the drop which adheres to the fibre after withdrawal to solidify.
