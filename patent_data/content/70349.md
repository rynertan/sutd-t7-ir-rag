## Description
Electrolyte for Eleetro chemical CellsThis invention relates to an electrolyte for use in electrochemical cells current producing cells or electrical accumulators of various types. The electrolyte contains a corn plexing agent which reduces electrode solubility improves electrolyte conductance and takes part In the charge discharge electrochemical reaction.in the continuing search for improved power sources considerable work has been done in investigating means for improving the performance of various electrochemical cells and storage batteries particularly in respect of size weight and capacity.Important applications for these being in such fields as hearing aids portable equipment space and satellite applications and ultimately electrically driven non poluting vehicles.One aspect of this work has naturally been to investigate also the electrolyte used in such cells. Factors of interest here are conductance current carrying capacity corrosion effects on electrodes and other cell parts etc. these factors vary with the concentration of the electrolyte temperature solubility of the electrodes and additives. Other important considerations are rate of chemical reaction charge transfer and in the case of many rechargeable cells such problems as dendrite growth deterioration of electrode structure loss of capacity and resultant short serviceable life.Variuos additives have been tested in electrochemical cells of different types and inorganic as well as organic additives as sometimes also used in the electroplating industry tried so as to combat dendrite growth improve charge transfer and reduce internal resistance or to generally, improve cell performance and life.Some references U.S. Patent 4.074.028 Will Feb 14, 1978Dendrite inhibiting electrolyte solution and rechargeable aqueous zinc halogen cell containing the solution.U.S. Patent 3.466.195 Speliman ESB Inc.

The present invention solves many of the previously mentioned problems and in degree dependent upon the cell type electrode structure and construction in which the electrolyte is used such a cell is improved in efficiency performance and economic desireability.The chemical reactions during charge and discharge of various electrochemical cells are not fully known and there are often a number of competing reaction schemes taking part.To one skilled in the art of electrochemical cell reactions be it as applied to electroplating or to electrical or rechargeable cells it is not essential to fully understand all details of the reactions taking part to make use of the invention. Furthermore the invention should of course be measured solely by means of the claims herein whereas the reactions taking place in n given electrochemical cell combination when using the electrolyte of this invention should not in any way be construed as defining or limiting the invention.The electrolyte of this invention is particularly advantageous when used in pre charged dry stored high capacity cells in metal air cells and in rechargeable cells such as Silver Zinc Ag Zn Nickel Cadmium Ni Cd Nickel Zinc Ni Zn Nickel Iron Ni Fe Lead Oxide PbO and metal Air cells and other cell systems etc. The constituent parts of the electrolyte and the optional initial additive of Fluoride in suitable form can equally well be used in cells having different electrolytes as also for the formation and activation of various electrodes prior to assembly into a cell as also for certain electroplating and electrochemical surface treatment processes. The electrolyte of this invention has in general improved conductivity particularly at low temperatures reducing cell internal resistance acting as a charge transfer medium it increases cell potential and improves cell stored capacity and efficiency by better utilisation of the electrode electrochemical capacity. In the case of rechargeable cells it will in addition combat dendrite formation by attenuation of electrode solubility and alteration of electrode conditions.In cells of the Silver Zinc type cell degradation due to Ag migration to the zinc electrode is also greatly attenuated and recycling life considerably extended even without recourse to special separators.The electrolyte comprises a Pottassium or Sodium Ferro orFerri Cyanide with or without a cyanide or ferricyanide of the electrode materials of the, cell as electrolyte in the form of 4 solution or as an addition in solution or salt form to an electrolyte, for electrochemical cells current producing cells or accumulators. The metalic Fe link retains the CN and avoids loss during recycling the Fe CN complex actually taking part in the charge discharge reaction.Dependent upon cell type electrodes and electrolyte composition a reduction of the electrode solubility follows which reduces or eliminates effects such as shape change loss of electrode capacity dendrite growth etc.In certain cases particularly in rechargeable cells withZinc electrodes an additional small addition of a suitableFluoride NaF or KF is also advantageous saturating the electrolyte with zincate ZnO can also be useful. The eletro lyte of this invention provides the following improvements when used in electrochemical cells as prescribed. These advantages are present in all aspects of the invention hereafter listed to a greater or lesser degree and will not be listed again separately in each example. 1 Lower internal cell resistance. 2 Better low temperature performance. 3 Higher output potential. 4 Better efficiency. 5 Better utilisation of electrode material. 6 Combatting of dendrite formation. 7 Longer Cell ll√Æe.

Alternatively 15 grams of KOH granules 85 KOH and 4 grams of Pottassium Ferricyanide K3Fe crT 6 can be dissolved per 300 ml of distilled water.The absolute ratios are not at all critical and in many cases even a very small amount of Pottassium Ferricyanide added to an existing electrolyte of many cells is sufficient to improve performance considerably.
