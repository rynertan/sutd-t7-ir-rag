Various kinds of oxygen reduction catalysts have been known. Especially, platinum has been well known as an oxygen reduction catalyst because of the superior catalytic properties. However, it is difficult to practically employ platininum as a catalyst in a fuel battery because platinum is expensive and a rare metal. Therefore, the development of new catalysts having a low oxygen reduction voltage and a high catalytic activity have been desired and made. However, catalysts which can take the place of platinum have not been found. The Co TAA having the formula VII EMI1.1 is reported as an oxygen reduction catalyst having a high activity in F.

Example 4Step 1EMI30.1 In 20 ml of N,N dimethylformamide were dissolved 5 millimol 690 mg of 4 methoxy o phenylenediamine and 2.5 millimol 625 mg of cobalt II acetate tetrahydrate, and the solution was heated at 1200C for 30 minutes. Then, the solution was added with 5 millimol 955 mg of B dimethylamino a p hydroxyphenyl acrolein, and refluxed underheat1ng in an argon gas atmosphere for 5 hours. The reaction solution was cooled and added with methanol to precipitated crystals. The crystals were separated by filtration, washed with methanol and dried. The yield was 7.5 .Step 2EMI31.1 In 10 ml of N,N dimethylformamide was dissolved the crystals obtained in Step 1. To the solution obtained were added 6 times amount of propyl iodide based on the millimol of the crystals and 6 times amount of potassium carbonate based on the millimol of the crystals. Then, the mixture was stirred at 250C for 12 hours. To the reaction mixture was added excess of water to precipitated crystals. The crystals were obtained by filtration, washed with methanol and dried to give dark purple crystals in a yield of 50 . The crystals have the following physical values.Mass Spectrum Calcd. 673.7 Found 673Elementary Analysis Calcd.

Example 210 The oxygen reduction catalyst activities of CoTAA as obtained in Examples 1, 3, 8, 19, 93, 96, 126, 140, f 154, 168, 188 and 198 were measured. The measurement was carried out in accordance with the cyclic voltammetry metbod by using a potentiostat. In 1 Q of chloroform or 1 Q of N,N dimethylformamide was dissolved 800 mg of Co TAA,and into the solution was dipped a Glassy Carbon trade name product of Tokai Denkyoku SeizoK.K. whose surface was mirror plane finished for 30 minutes. The Glassy Carbon was taken out from the solution and left to stand to dryness. The treated glassy carbon was employed as a cathode electrode. A platinum coil was employed as an anode electrode and a calomel electrode was employed as a reference electrode. The electrolyte solution was IN sulfuric acid and the measurement temperature was 250C. The measurement was carried out by introducing a high purity oxygen gas into the electrolytic solution and recording the electric current generated by varying the voltage from 800 mV to 600 mV at a velocity of 25 mV sec. The catalyst activity was evaluated by the generated electric current value at 375 mV. The measurement was repeated 10 times and the catalyst life was evaluated by the tenth measurement result, that is, the tenth catalyst activity.5The measurement results are shown in Table 2.
