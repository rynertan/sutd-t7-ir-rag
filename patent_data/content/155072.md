# An apparatus for x ray photography of the area of the dentition and of the jaws.

## Abstract
The specification relates to an apparatus for panoramic X ray photography of the area of the dentition and the jaws, the apparatus comprising a frame part 1 , a bearing part 2 linear ly movable in relation to the frame part, and a support arm 10 attached with bearings rotatably to the bearing part, the arm having at one end an X ray film 11 and at the opposite end a source of X radiation 12 . The movements of the bearing part 2 , the support arm 10 and the film 11 are mutually syn chronized in such a way that an image of an area of the desired shape, for example the shape of the patient s dental arch, is ob tained on the film during the movement. It is the object of the invention to provide a possibility, without shifting the patient, to alter the enlargement coefficient and, as an additional ef fect, to provide the possibility of tilting the X ray beam to the desired angle in relation to the horizontal plane, whereby it will be possible to photograph more sharply than previously, for example, teeth oblique in relation to the vertical level. In ac cordance with the invention, the support arm 10 is attached to the bearing part 2 by mediation of structural parts 9, 16 which are equipped with guides 22, 24 extending in the long tudinal direction of the support arm 10 and with transfer means 19, 20, 21 , in such a way that the support arm 10 , in other words the source of radiation 12 and the X ray film 11 , can be transferred in a direction parallel to the X ray beam. Furthermore, the said structural parts 9, 16 have curved rails 13, 14 which work in conjunction with each other, the mutual movement of the rails affecting the tilt of the support arm. The adjustment movements are preferably ef fected by stepping motors.
