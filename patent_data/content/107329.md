# Hydraulically actuated starting clutch assembly.

## Abstract
A hydraulically actuated starting clutch and more par ticularly a starting clutch 10 for a continuously variable transmission which is located at the output of the transmis sion to couple the vehicle wheels to the engine upon a sig nal from the throttle induced system oil pressure. The clutch includes a cover 26 connected to the drive shaft through a hub forming a pressure chamber behind a piston, a Belle ville spring 56 acted upon by the piston and urging a pressure plate 37 against the clutch plate and an end plate secured in the cover. Weights are mounted on the Belleville spring to compensate for the centrifugal effect of the oil in the pressure chamber. The clutch plate is operatively con nected to a sleeve shaft to drive the differential for the vehi cle wheels.
