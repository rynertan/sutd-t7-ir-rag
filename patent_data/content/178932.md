# Method and apparatus for measurement of component video signal characteristics.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for measuring characteristics of a component color video signal. In one embodiment the luminance component of a color video signal is applied to the vertical input of a cathode ray tube display device and a chrominance component is applied to the horizontal input. The resultant dots and transitions therebetween produced by the display trace provide an indication of component band width, amplitude and relative time between components. All components can be compared simultaneously by alternately applying one chrominance component with the luminance component, and the other chrominance component with an inverted luminance component. In another embodiment one chrominance component is applied to the vertical input and the other is applied to the horizontal input. Delay circuits are provided for use with a time division multiplexed video signal to compare time multiplexed components simul taneously. A graticule is provided for relating the display trace to a standard display.
