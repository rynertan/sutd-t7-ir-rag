# Preparation of storage stable serum.

## Abstract
Human and animal sera are used in biological analyses for the preparation of calibration liquids and controls. This invention provides a method of treating the sera to render them more storage stable and consistent, which involves insolubilising components thereof, for example by reducing the pH, removing the precipitates so formed, and stabilising the resulting liquid, for example by raising its pH to 7 to 8. The treated sera have extended storage life and may be lyophilised.
