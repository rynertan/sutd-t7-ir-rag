# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR AUTOMATED DOUBLE FLUOROCHROMIZATION ANALYSIS IN LYMPHOCYTOTOXICITY TESTING

## Abstract
An automated system for rapid sequential photometric analysis of a collection of double fluorochrome stained lym phocyte specimens, useful for antibody screening or lym phocytotoxicity analysis. The specimens are sequentially alternately irradiated with light of two distinguishable wavelengths, producing fluorescence at two distinguishable wavelengths. The fluorescent emission light intensity for each irradiation of each specimen is measured using a photometer and computer. The computer controls the syn chronization of the irradiation through alternately selected condenser sets with the sequential movement of specimens into the optical path of the irradiating and detected light, and calculates the ratio of the light intensities emitted from each specimen at the two selected fluorescent light wavelengths. These ratios are compared against a control ratio for lym phocytotoxicity analysis to classify the specimen. Also de scribed is a method of preparing specimens for such analy sis, which requires that a complement be added to the first staining solution after the latter is applied to the specimens, then this combination agitated, and then the second staining solution added and the specimen incubated.
