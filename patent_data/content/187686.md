# RUBBER THREAD COVERED WITH ONE OR MORE WINDINGS HAVING A CONTROLLED AND LIMITED ELASTICITY, METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ITS PRODUCTION

## Abstract
In a rubber thread covered with one or more coils, one or more inelastic, semirigid or texturized yarns are inserted parallel to the elastic thread, in order to brake elongation of the elastic thread, so as to determine a maximum amount of admissible stretch, and to avoid yielding, strangulation and breakage of the rubber thread. The method and the appar atus designed to make such an elastic thread with controlled elasticity are also described.
