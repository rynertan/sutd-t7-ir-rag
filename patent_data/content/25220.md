Specifically, the surface is made the cathode in an electrolyte of aq. gold cyanide. Additional metal hardening components such as Co, Ni, Ca and As are present. Plating conditions are adjusted to pH 7.5 or less, 50 deg. C or less and current is not more than 0 9i where i is the mass transport limiting current beyond which gold plating rate does not increase, while the flow rate of fluid is at least 50 cm sec. over the surface to be coated.. Used in electrical switches, the plating efficiency is higher than in prior hard gold plating, as high as for soft gold. Increased limiting current conditions obtain, while bath chemistry is simplified and costs are reduced. The operating temp. is lower than in prior art.

## Description
Background of the Invention A. Technical Field The invention is concerned with gold electroplating procedure and resulting product. More specifically, the invention is concerned with gold electroplate of hardness and wear characteristics generally associated with so called hard gold . Such gold is of significance in electrical switch contacts, and in a variety of other devices, as well as in ornamentation. B. History The noble metal elements, particularly gold, have found extensive use because of their resistance to corrosion. Gold, generally as electroplated, is of extreme device interest as contact surface in electrical switches of a variety of designs. Aside from silicon and its related compounds, gold is the one element common to large scale integrated circuits. Due, again, to corrosion resistance and, consequently, retention of initial appearance, gold has been used for ornamentation since ancient times. This field, to a large extent, too, is preempted by electroplating. Elemental gold is a physically soft material with generally poor wear qualities. Twenty four karat pure gold is impractical for most uses. A variety of alloying elements improve these qualities without significantly affecting corrosion resistance, and resultant alloys are in extensive use. For electrical purposes, hard gold generally takes the form of gold of reasonable purity containing tenths of a percent of an alloying ingredient. Alloying ingredients in prevalent use, particularly in electroplated hard gold, are cobalt and nickel. Decades of use have yielded a sophisticated technology with baths of wellcontrolled composition and long shelf life, and with processes characterized by reliability and high throughput. Bath compositions generally contain gold and other metallic ingredients in complexed or ionic form with the gold introduced often as a potassium or sodium cyanide salt. For the most part, hard gold bath compositions are buffered to acid or near neutral pH values, for example, in citrate or phosphate systems. Initially introduced to avoid substrate attack, for example, on phenol formaldehyde impregnated circuit boards, such buffered baths have other advantages and are in general use. In so active a field, it is to be expected that research and development continue apace. Problems, once considered tolerable, are of increasing concern with the trend toward miniaturization. For electrical contact purposes, for example, contact resistance is a function of and is strongly dependent upon closely controlled alloy metal concentration. Further, it has been observed that contact resistance, at an acceptable level on a freshly plated structure, deteriorates with age. Other studies are directed at economic implications in processing, so that there is a constant emphasis on improving throughput and, generally, on reducing cost. Work by H. Reinheimer, reported in 1974 121,Journal of the Electrochemical Society, 490, 1974 , while generally directed to studies relating to soft or pure gold electrodeposit, is relevant. Studies revealed that deposits from pure gold bath were of increasing hardness as the temperature of the bath was reduced from usual plating temperature of 60 90 degrees C. The significance of this finding was likely not overlooked by those concerned with hard gold. Process simplification offered by elimination of alloying ingredients in the production of hard gold electroplate would significantly advance the field.H. Reinheimer s work did not, however, result in acceptance of nonalloyed hard gold. For example, the nonalloyed hard gold is unacceptable for demanding electrical use due to surface roughness. Summary of the Invention Additive Free Hard Gold hereinafter referred to as AFHG electroplate produced in accordance with this invention from buffered cyanide bath under specified plating conditions satisfies demanding requirements, for example, for electrical switch use.AFHG electroplate of the invention is characterized by a high degree of surface smoothness as well as values both of physical hardness and initial contact resistance comparable to cobalt hardened gold electroplate. Aging, either shelf or in use, results in little change in contact resistance relative to that experienced with cobalt hardened gold an advantage likely attributable to the aging mechanism for cobalt hardened gold electroplate which invokes the surface oxidation of initially present or migrating cobalt to form the resistive compound CoO . As expected, some cost reduction results from simplification of the bath chemistry. Like usual soft gold electroplating, plating efficiency is high. Typical values are at least twice that of plating from usual additive hardened gold bath solutions. Under many circumstances, increased limiting current conditions are permitted so that actual plating rate and, therefore, throughput may be increased. That condition, required for all purposes in accordance with the invention and representing the major departure from the above mentioned Reinheimer work, is a high degree of agitation. Preferred processing conditions result in turbulence. It will be seen from the Detailed Description that surface smoothness which typifies the invention may result under a variety of processing conditions. From the economic standpoint, significance is attached to those conditions which permit high throughput. Preferred embodiments are selected accordingly and, generally, contemplate a degree of agitation necessary to produce turbulence. Alternative embodiments rely on macroscopic disturbance which, like conventional turbulence, results in permissible increase in current density. Such alternatives include actual brushing of the surface being plated, ultrasonic agitation of the workpiece, moving fins, and designs in which the workpiece is not immersed but is wetted by bath fluid propelled by nozzles or other means. For most immersion apparatus , i.e., apparatus in which the workpiece is at all times immersed in the bath, contemplated flow conditions of the bath fluid in the vicinity of the workpiece is at about 50 cm sec or preferably 100 cm sec or higher. Nonimmersion apparatus may permit equivalent agitation at lower bulk liquid flow.Where nonconventional means of agitation are provided, i.e., nonimmersion apparatus, fins, or other provision for spoiling streamline flow, bulk flow may be lower. Other preferred processing parameters are set to satisfy high throughput. These include gold concentration of at least 5 g l expressed as elemental gold, plating current density greater than 5 mA cm2 and a temperature range of from about 0 50 degrees C. Brief Description of the Drawing FIG. 1 is a cross sectional view of one type of plating apparatus suitable for practice of the invention FIG. 2 is a schematic view of a strip plater line suitable for use in accordance with the invention, particularly where very high throughput is desired FIG. 3 is a cross sectional view of the high speed plating cell included in the line of FIG. 2 and FIG. 4, on coordinates of Knoop hardness on the ordinate and temperature on the abscissa, is a plot relating those two characteristics for plating produced in accordance with the invention under a set of conditions in which other relevant parameters were maintained constant.Detailed Description I. THE DRAWING FIG. 1 depicts a 1,rug electroplating apparatus 1 consisting of recepticle 2 containing electroplating bath 3. Workpiece to be plated is depicted as 4 which may be a front elevational view of the first of a series of separable connectors to be plated on both of faces 5 and 6.Bath is partly carried and partly projected at surfaces 5 and 6 by means of rotating electrodes 7 and 8, each provided with looped pile fabric surfaces 9 and 10, respectively. Stop 11 serves as a support for workpiece 4 and may also assure an appropriate path for bath carried by electrodes 7 and 8. Jaws 12 and 13 adjustable as schematically depicted by the double headed arrows are tipped by titanium members 14 and 15. Jaws 12 and 13 are biased cathodic relative to rotating electrodes 7 and 8 by means not shown and thereby serve both as guides and electrical contacts for workpiece 4. FIG. 2 is a schematic representation of a typical strip plating line 20. As depicted, pieceparts on a continuous strip 21 are fed through the line by capstans 22 and 23. Processing positions 24 28 are defined by partitions within common member 29. Each reservoir is provided with means for circulating fluid contents such means including schematically depicted outlet path 30 and inlet path 31 with such paths connecting processing positions 24 28 with reservoirs 32 36.In a typical strip plating line 20, processing positions may include electrocleaning at 24 workpieces reverse biased with the processing fluid typically consisting of a strong alkali solution , electropolishing at 25, again, with the workpiece anodic, and with the fluid typically consisting of a highly viscous acid such as phosphoric acid , nickel plating at 26, gold strike plating at 27, possibly by AFHG plating, but here using a highly dilute solution and high current density to cause high hydrogen evolution and to scrub the surface to be plated and, finally, the inventive AFHG plating at 28. FIG. 3 depicts an in line plating cell 40 suitable for incorporation at 28 in FIG. 2. As shown, the cell consists of recepticle 41, containing a plenum 42, which carries a moving stream of plating solution 43.Fluid 43 is maintained under pressure to result in jet 44 emanating from slit 45. Control means for positioning of jet 44 include movable plate 46 provided with vertical adjusting means 47, as well as plenum 48 which carries pressurized gas 49 to result in stream 50, which emanates through slit 51. The workpiece 52 depicted may, again, be regarded as a separable contact which is maintained in position, while moving by walls 53 and 54, as well as roller support 55. As shown, workpiece 52 is to be plated only on lower portion of surface 56. Overplating on surface 57 is prevented by means of gas stream 50. In operation, workpiece 52 is biased cathodically relative to plenum 42 which is biased anodically both by means not shown. Recirculating means also not shown includes reservoir 58. FIG. 4, on coordinates of Knoop hardness under 25 grams load on the ordinate, and plating temperature in degrees Celsius on the abscissa, is a typical curve form showing the relationship between those two parameters. The high temperature limit of 70 degrees C shown is outside the inventive scope and is barely sufficient to result in a hardness of value of 90. The low temperature limit of zero degrees C is not limiting in these terms. II. PROCESS PARAMETERS A. General All processing in accordance with the invention presupposes conditions yielding a hard plate i.e., a plate of at least 90 and preferably at least 100 on the Knoop hardness scale. This desideratum requires only operation at or below 50 degrees C or preferably at or below 45 degrees C. Other variables are considered in terms of surface smoothness i.e., a surface topology in which elevation variations are no greater than about 0.5 pm total peak to valley as measured over a sample area 5 pm square.In these terms, such processing variables and convenient units are Plating current density, i mA cm2 Mass transport limiting current density the total current beyond which gold deposition rate does not increase, il mA cm2 Concentration of gold, C g l Linear flow speed, u cm sec Temperature, T degrees C .The form of the relationship which shows interdependence of these variables except for plating current density is il kCuX T a Y in which k and a are constants greater than zero. Mass transport limiting current density il may be determined from the relationship above. Inventive conditions depend upon a plating current density i which is significantly lower than il. The numerical value of the fraction i il must be maintained below about 0.9 to avoid rough and or discolored plating. Description is in terms of maximum permitted current on the basis of this fractional value with this maximum permissible current being defined as imaXt i.e., imaX 0.9 il. Under any set of parameters i may be equal to or less than imaXf i.e., i il and, in fact, lesser currents may result in further improvement in smoothness. Certain practical limits may be set on operating parameters. These are based on a plating rate of at least 0.C1 pm sec and include 2 i, plating current density, 5 mA cm For most practical purposes, lower currents result in uneconomically low plating rates. Further, such lower currents may favor preferential deposition and result in surface features which interfere with desired smoothness. u, agitation expressed as linear flow speed, 25 cm sec. Such flow rates are attainable in advanced production equipment. Under usual conditions, lower agitation rates do not result in required surface smoothness for plating current density values, i, at 5 mA cm2. C 5 g l expressed as grams of elemental gold per liter of bath solution . Lower gold concentration results in a plating current density value, imam, of less than about 5 mA cm2 for high throughput under most conditions. T 0 degrees C. Substantially lower temperatures result in lowered diffusion coefficients in the delta layer and in lowered kinematic viscosities to preclude high throughput under most conditions. B. Preferred Process Parameters This section is largely in terms of a permissible throughput corresponding with a plating rate of at least 0.01 pm sec. 1 Agitation For most commercial processing, at least on a regular basis, it is expected that processing will take the form of throughput values which approach permissible limits for particular equipment. Equipment limitations are most significant in terms of agitation.Preferred embodiments are described in terms of agitation resulting in flow rates of at least 25 cm sec or at least about 50 or 100 cm sec in order of increasing preference. This most significant parameter is, to some extent, dependent upon apparatus design. The general purpose of agitation is to increase the transport limited current so as in turn to decrease the fraction represented by the actual current density divided by the transport limited current density. As discussed, requisite surface smoothness results from a lessening value of this fraction.Where no unusual provision is made for disturbing streamline flow, desired smoothness is realized only with for flow rates of at least 50 cm sec or preferably at least 100 cm sec. Such rates are used in apparatus such as that depicted in FIG. 3. Provision of baffles, fins, ultrasonic vibration, etc. permits attainment of desired surface smoothness for somewhat lower bulk flow rates and for this purpose a minimum of about 25 cm sec is generally prescribed. Use of nonimmersion equipment, such as that depicted in FIG. 1, may permit such low bulk flow rate or even lower values. Here the general mechanism by which bath fluid is transported to the workpiece gives rise to the requisite degree of agitation. In common with prior art usage, agitation defines that condition which obtains at some distance from the surface being plated. This distance corresponds with the thickness of the hydrodynamic boundary layer. Use of flow rate or bulk flow rate refers to flow rates as measured outside of this boundary layer. Measurement at a distance of a millimeter is appropriate. 2 Temperature As noted, the maximum permissible temperature remains at about 50 degrees C. Higher temperatures result in coatings of lowered hardness values.A low temperature limit of about 0 degrees C is considered a practical limit due to lowered efficiency, as well as reduced throughput. The maximum temperature is somewhat arbitrary, since further decrease results in increased hardness. A preferred maximum temperature is 45 degrees C. 3 Plating Rate This paramater is not truly an independent variable but results directly from the current density and plating efficiency. Preferred embodiments are considered to correspond with a plating rate of at least about 0.03 pm sec. Experimentally, this plating rate was found to correspond with a current density of about 50 mA cm2. 4 Current Efficiency Typically, values are on a level of at least 85 percent for a fresh bath. Actual measured values have been as high as 95 percent and higher.Indicated current efficiencies represent a significant advance over usual additive hardened gold plating which are operated at typical values of 50 percent and below. Throughput In actual experience, permitted maximum throughput, relative to that for additive hardened gold, has been realized. For given apparatus, maximum throughput for equivalent coating quality has been as much as twice or three times that for cobalt hardened gold.Preferred processes in accordance with the invention take advantage of this throughput advantage. III. BATH COMPOSITION A Gold Gold, always measured in terms of equivalent elemental content, is desirable at a level of 25 grams liter or higher. In common with other plating processes, gold content may become limiting for high throughput and, accordingly, the solubility limit may be approached. All results obtained have been from cyanide solution and the invention is discussed in terms of alkali metal gold cyanide regardless of the form in which gold is initially introduced. The alkali metal is usually potassium so that gold content is considered to be in the nominal form KAu CN 2. Lithium salts are an order of magnitude more soluble than potassium salts and may be particularly useful for very high throughput processes. As discussed in Section VI, cyanide is considered essential for AFHG plating and at least some amount of cyanide must be present in the bath to realize required hardness. For these purposes, it is considered that the amount of cyanide must be such as to satisfy the nominal formula KAu CN 2 for at least 50 percent of the gold in the bath. B pH Modifier Useful results in accordance with the inventive teaching have been realized only at bath pH below about 9.0 with a preference for a pH maximum of about 7.5. As discussed in Section IV, pH is a relevant quantity for ideal plating morphology. While smooth coatings may result at somewhat higher pH values, practical buffer systems are largely within a range defined by that maximum and by a minimum of about 3.0. A system considered particularly desirable depends upon presence of phosphate ion. Accepted buffer systems are known. KH2PO4 has a natural buffer pH range over 4.3 4.5 for 100 g l equivalent KH2PO4 . With added KOH, the range may be shifted in the alkaline direction so that e.g., addition of 28 g l KOH results in a pH range of 6.8 to 7.2.The term buffer is not intended to serve as a rigorous, mechanistic description. Ranges set forth whether buffered or not are conveniently maintained in bath compositions indicated. Phosphate ion has the desired effect of cleansing the bath of nonnoble metal ingredients. Such contaminants are precipitated out in the form of phosphates. Other acidifying ingredients may otherwise be substituted in whole or in part. Such subsitutions include citrate ion, possibly considered present as potassium citrate. Use of citrate ion, again, as optionally supplemented by a soluble base, such as KOH, results in an easily maintained pH range of from 3.0 to 6.0. C Reducing Agent as in other gold plating, formation of Au III is a contributor to diminishing plating efficiency. In the inventive processes, permitted throughput may also suffer. Addition of reducing agent may lessen this source of inefficiency. Reducing agents should be chosen so as to avoid contamination to levels above those indicated in section D below. Hydrazine hydrate has been slowly added as Au III forms to maintain initial plating efficiency. Use of excess hydrazine, however, results in reduction of Au I and, consequently, in decomposition of the bath. In one series of experiments, rejuvenation, after four turnovers, was effected by addition of the analytically determined amount of 85 percent aqueous hydrazine hydrate required to reduceAu CN 4 to Au CN 2 .Four hour treatment at 75 degrees C was sufficient to lessen the 30 percent accumulation ofAu III to 0.4 percent. Subsequent plating was at the 94 percent plating efficiency realized in the fresh bath.Addition of this or other reducing agent may be made a part of the regular replenishment procedure. D Other Ingredients Generally, other ingredients are not desirable for the generic process. Plating efficiency and throughput are a direct consequence of minimal action contamination so that inclusions of this nature, at least in significant amount, are undesired from an economic standpoint. Ions other than gold fall into three categories of diminishing consequence and, therefore, increasing tolerable concentration. The categories are 1 Hardening ingredients of the corroding type e.g., cobalt, nickel, which result in contact resistance increase upon aging due to oxidation and therefore of particular consequence in electrical apparatus which is not hermetically sealed . Permitted content is desirably 0.01 g l for an assumed gold content of 20 g l generally 0.05 weight percent in the deposited film. 2 Hardening noncorroding ingredients e.g., silver may impair plating efficiency but are not harmful in the plating in small quantities. Bath compositions of up to about 0.1 g l for gold content of 20 g l to yield platings up to 0.5 weight percent impurity which do not differ in any important characteristic from those produced from baths in which such ingredients are at an undetectable level. 3 Nonhardening ingredients may generally be present in the bath to any amount based on specific intended application of the resultant coating. Accordingly, the potassium generally included in the soluble gold species, as well as the pH modifier, is of no consequence in the coating. Calcium is of consequence only in very large amount and may be included up to 1.0 g l or 5 weight percent based on gold. Other ingredients, intentional or unintentional, may generally be included as desired. IV APPARATUS Suitable apparatus is exemplified by that depicted in FIGS. 1, 2, and 3. Other apparatus permitting agitation and plating rates set forth may be used. Common to other gold plating processes, gold may be introduced as a soluble bath constitutent or as an anode constituent. It has been noted that loss in efficiency results from oxidation of Au I Au III . Au III accumulation is significantly lessened by use of gold anode, with the probable mechanism based on anode gold dissolution preferential to oxidation. Anode dissolution was found to be impractically fast with loss of the anode after 100 hours of continuous plating for apparatus such as that depicted in FIG. 1 under one set of conditions.An alternative designed to lessen Au III accumulation depends upon use of a ruthenium oxide titanium oxide catalyzed anode. The electrode structure is primarily titanium, which is coated with a mixture of the two oxides and is known as dimensionally stable anode . See U. S. PatentNo. 4,067,783 issued January 10, 1978 Okinaka et al Case 10 3 . In one set of experiments using a dimensionally stable anode, Au III never exceeded 5 percent of total gold and current efficiency remained above 87 percent over four bath turnovers. An alternative structure is coated with iridium oxide and tantalum oxide. V EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE AND RESULTSIntroduction Information presented in this section is distilled from extensive experimentation. It includes plating under conditions outside the scope of the invention as defined by the claims. This information is significant in understanding the mechanism and boundary conditions which apply. Reported data was derived from samples plated under two sets of conditions i low speed plating, and ii high speed plating.The designations are of no significance in the description of the invention but are useful in that they bridge relatively low and high agitation rates. Low speed plating was conducted in a beaker with agitation resulting from magnetic stirring. Flow rate was approximately 1 cm sec.Anodes were 10 cm2 and consisted of platinized titanium mesh at the bottom of the beaker. Substrates were 3 cm2 copper coupons cleaned by light etching in 50 percent nitric acid followed by rinsing. High speed plating was conducted on the cell of FIG. 3. Flow conditions were turbulent. Plating was continuous on separable connectors which were surface coated with a thin gold strike. Plating was continued for a period of 15 sec. A Hardness 1 Low Speed Plating Hardness measurements were taken using a hardness tester with a Knoop indenter at 25 gram load on gold plated copper foils. Plating current was at 10 mA cm2. Data is presented in tabular form TABLE I Bath Temperature Microhardness Efficiency Degrees C KHN Percent 10 147 79 20 148 77 30 189 77 45 158 75 70 104 68It is seen from TABLE I that hardness is relatively independent of plating temperature in the range of 10 45 degrees C. An increase in plating temperature to 70 degrees C results in a,significant fall off in hardness to a value of about 100. Hardness stability was measured by one hour anneals at temperatures of 250, 350, and 450 degrees C.There was no measurable softening at 250 degrees C and only at 450 degrees C was softening significant. 2 High Speed Plating Hardness measurements were made on 25 vm thickness sections. As for low speed plating, hardness is relatively independent of temperature below about 45 degrees C. Data is in tabular form TABLE II Plating Hardness PlatingConditions Appearance KHN Efficiency OC mA cm2 30 85 Bright 167 74 30 120 Bright 209 84 30 153 Semibright 193 83 43 85 Bright 182 79 43 170 Bright 188 87 From TABLE II, it is seen that hardness is generally within the device significant range 140 200 KHN. From the semibright appearance reported, it appears that a current density of 153 mA cm2 exceeds the critical value of approximately 0.9 il at 300C. B Wear 1 Low Speed Plating Wear response was measured with crossed rods as follows Two 2 millimeter 0.08 diameter rods of hard copper plated with 2.5 jim gold were mounted at right angles. The lower rod was cycled under a 200 gram load to produce a wear track of about 4 millimeter 5 32 .After 500 cycles samples were removed and the width of the wear tracks was measured using an optical microscope.Type of wear was characterized qualitatively in terms of 1 galling 2 brittle fracture 3 excellent resistance to wear. TABLE IIIBath Temperature Average Wear Type of Wear degrees C Track Width in Response Mils pm 22 4.4 111.76 Excellent 45 4.2 106.68 Excellent 70 10.0 254.00 Severe Galling Data presented is illustrative of extensive experimentation. Failure was evident only at 700C. 2 High Speed Plating Plated test connectors were assembled in a comb. Plating thickness was at a nominal minimum of 2.5 pm. The comb was mated two hundred times with a female. The comb was then cleaned in boiling trichloroethane and was tested for wear induced porosity.Thickness was measured at three locations by beta backscatter. The mean thickness of all measurements was 3 0.25 ym. Of twenty five specimens, all but five were free of pores. Three had one pore each, and two had two pores each. Reported results are at least as good as those measured on a control sample identical to that described but plated with a popular alloy hardened gold. C. Contact Resistance 1 Low Speed Plating Measurements were conducted on freshly prepared samples using a four wire probe system. Samples were copper coupons, as described above. Thermal aging studies were conducted at 150 degreesC following which resistance measurements were, again, made with the same apparatus Initial values were at 0.9 l.Spm after 168 hours were at 1.1 1.7mQ and after 504 hours were at l.l 3.0m. Values both as initially conducted and after aging were significantly better than those measured on alloy hardened gold as plated under optimum conditions from a commercial bath composition. The aging temperature of 150 degrees C is regarded as a severe test used only for development purposes. 2 High Speed Plating Three connectors were plated at 45 degrees C, 170 mA cm2 to a thickness of 2.5 vm. Measurements were as described under 1 above.Following initial measurement ranges, specimens were aged at 150 degrees C for 168 hours. Resistance measurements in milliohms as initially deposited and after aging were 1.42.6 and 1.2 4.0. Data developed was better than that for similarly prepared specimens plated from commercial alloy hardened gold. As expected, improvement after thermal aging was pronounced, reflecting absence of hardening agent which as oxidized is considered the most significant contributor to increased contact resistance. VI. MECHANISTIC CONSIDERATIONS While the invention is described in terms of readily measured parameters, some further understanding may result from consideration of postulated mechanism. A. Hardness Prior workers have recognized formation of AuCN during gold electroplating Electrochimica Acta, 173, 18, pp. 829 834 J. Electrochemical Society, 119, pp. 672 677,J. Electroanalytical Chem., 40 1972 pp. 113 120,J. Electroanalytical Chem., 99, 1979 p. 341, 346 . Study of specimens prepared by AFHG have revealed presence of AuCN in amount which increases with hardness and at a level such as to indicate more than one formula unit per grain. It may be postulated that this compound is responsible for stabilization of small grains which are, in turn, responsible for hardness. Stabilization likely results from initiation of grain boundaries with each AuCN center due to lattice mismatch. It is unnecessary to relate AuCN count to nucleation of grains but a thermodynamically consistent mechanism may be proposed.Relatively high free energy at each AuCN site may give rise to nucleation at such site so that the compound serves not only to stabilize grains but is responsible for initial grain growth. Softening of coatings at increasing temperature is, in any event, quite consistent with the expected temperature dependence of adsorption. Softening at high pH values is consistent with known solubility ofAuCN so that such grain nucleator stabilizer is not retained in the coating. B. Smoothness Coating growth at currents closely approaching il, the mass transport limiting current, may result in i1 controlled deposition. Current reduction to levels of 0.9 il and lower, permit equilibration at the interface so that coating is not il limited but is controlled by random processes which tend both to prevent nodules and or minimize nodule contribution to surface topology. Under these circumstances, growth is both lateral and in the direction of the concentration gradient within the delta layer with any nodules thickening at rates presumed at least equal to that resulting in vertical growth. VII. THE ELECTROPLATE Electroplate of the invention is characterized by three parameters a Hardness Generally measured in terms ofKnoop hardness KHN . A KHN pf 100 is sufficient to differentiate from usual soft gold which, as generally conceived, is no harder than 80. A preferable lower limit is 120. For many switch device purposes, where long life is significant, hardness may be specified in terms of some higher minimum value. Various device designs require XHN values of 130 and 140. Such hardness numbers are readily available in accordance with the invention. b Composition Inventive electroplate in accordance with the invention is characterized by freedom from metallic hardening ingredients other than gold to a total level of about 0.1 weight percent based on the total weight of the electroplate. Metals in common use as hardening ingredients are cobalt, nickel, cadmium, and arsenic. It is expected that commercial utilization will take the form of electroplate which is free of all metals other than gold to the same total maximum content of 0.1 weight percent on the same basis and this represents a preferred embodiment. Coatings produced experimentally have evidenced a total freedom of all metal ingredients including noble metals, other than gold, to the same maximum level of 0.1 weight percent on the same basis. c Smoothness The inventive advance is meaningfully described in terms of this parameter. The invention makes possible AFHG electroplate which is free of topological deviations as measured in a direction normal to the electroplate surface to a maximum of 0.5 m from nominal within 5 jim square sample areas. To allow for possible edge deviations, total sample area is specified as totaling at least 95 percent of an entire face surface plated. In plating, surfaces which are essentially continuous, either flat or curved, the smoothness standard described may be applicable to the entirety of the region.
