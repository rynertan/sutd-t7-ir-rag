## Description
SUPPOSITORY BASE AND PHARMACEUTICAL cDMPOSITIDNS FOR RECTAL ADMINISTRATION, AND PROCESS FOR THEIR PRODUCTION The present invention relates to a suppository base composition for rectal administration for a useful compound, for example, compounds having a 8 lactam ring. Compounds having a B lactam ring, inclusive of antibiotics such as penicillins and cephalosporins, exhibit a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, and are known to be therapeutic agents for a variety of microbial infections. Administration by injection or and oral administration is the usual method of administration adopted conventionally for these antibiotics. Administration by injection is superior in terms of in vivo absorption of active ingredients but accompanied with drawbacks such as shortened duration of high concentration level in bloods and pain inherently involved. On the other hand, oral administration leads in many cases to poor bidavailability and is almost by means of capsules in the dosage form, thus suffering from disadvantages such as being difficult for children to swallow. In order to overcome these disadvantages, compositions adapted for administration into the rectum have been proposed, but such antibiotics as penicillins and cephalosporins can hardly be absorbed into body merely by their rectal administration in such dosage forms as dispersed in a fatty, oily or aqueous base. Under such circumstances, a method has been developed,for example, comprising incorporating a nonionic surfactant such as polyoxyethylene lauryl alcohol ether and the like together with a base to increase absorption of the particular penicillin or cephalosporin U.S. patent 3881012 and French patent 2275214 .However, eve n by the use of a composition prepared by the method as above, the concentration level of antibiotics in blood is still lower than that attained by injection.When a higher concentration level is desired, the amount of addition of the surfactant must be increased, which leads to the intensified local irritation to inevitably cause defecation or expulsion of suppositories. Explanation is made with respect to a ss lactam ring compound hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the present suppository base can be similarly applied to any other useful compounds in place of the ss lactam ring compound. The present inventors found that by adding polyoxyethylene cholesterol ether or polyoxyethylene hydrogenated cholesterol ether to a composition containing a ss lactam ring compound being generally less absorbable upon rectal administration and a fatty or oily base, there is obtained the composition permitting very fast absorption of the ss lactam ring compound through the rectum, not showing side effects such as promotion of defecation and maintaining high concentration levels of the drug substance in blood for a longer period of time than administration in the injection dosage form, and have come to complete the present invention Thus, the present invention relates to compositions for rectal administration which contain compounds having a g lactam ring, polyoxyethylene cholesterol ether or and polyoxyethylene hydrogenated cholesterol ether and an oily base. The compounds having a 6 lactam ring according to the present invention include, for example, the penicillin and cephalosporin compounds of the general formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 is zn acylamide or amidino group R2 is a hydrogen atom or a lover alkoxy group X representsEMI3.1 where R and P. are the same or different, and each means a hydrogen atom or a methyl group R3 is a hydrogen atom, lower alkyl e.g. methyl, ethyl, etc. , halogen e.g. chlorine, etc. , formyl or a group .

The average number of added moles of POE is normally selected from nearly 5 to 50 moles and, particularly, the adducts having nearly 10 to 30 moles of POE are especially good for promotion of absorption. As the fatty or oily excipients of the present invention, use is made of fatty or oily bases which have been concentionally employed for suppositories, etc. As examples of such bases there may be mentioned glycerides of higher fatty acids e.g., naturally occurring cacao butter, Witepsol produced by Dynamit Nobel AG, a semi synthetic base , glycerides of medium chain fatty acids e.g. Mtgryol produced by Dynamit Nobel AG , and oils of plant origin e.g. sesame oil, soybean oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, etc. .

The composition for human rectal administration is normally recommended to be given by, for example, the suppository weighing 0.5 to 3.5 g each, twice or three times daily.The rectal administration according to the present invention is highly safe to man and animals. The Experiment Examples are given in the following. Percentage means t by weight in Examples below. Experiment Example 1 Employing the representative compounds having a S lactam ring, the areas under blood level versus time curves AUC, Area Under the Curve were measured with the various control references and the compositions of the present invention, as shown in Table 1. Suppositories containing different compounds having a ss lactam ring were given, in the form of fatty solid suppositories 150 mg each , into the rectum of SD strain male rats body weight of 250 to 300 g being fasted for 15 to 20 hours and anesthetized with a barbital. The anuses were closed with an adhesive agent, and blood samples were taken from the tail veins with time elapsed to determine quantitatively the plasma levels of the compounds having a ss lactam ring by means of the biological assay method. The test microorganism for the assay was varied with type of the compounds having a ss lactam ring, and Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6638, Escherichia coli NIHJ, Pseudomonas aerugionosa NCTC 10490 and Proteus mirabilisATCC 21100 were employed.
