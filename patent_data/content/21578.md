# Heat bondable laminates of polyester and metal foil and containers made from them.

## Abstract
Heat bondable laminates of polyester 2 bonded to one surface of a metal aluminium foil 3 the other surface of which is bonded to a polyolefin heat bondable layer 4 . Laminates of this type are used to make food containers 1 to replace metal cans which are sterilised at 125 C. The heat bondable layer used hitherto has been high density polyethylene which has a melting point too close to 125 C and gives only barely adequate tear strength and impact resistance. The laminates of this invention use instead of the polyethylene, a sequential copolymer of propylene with 12 to 30 by weight ethylene and containers made from them achieve better tear strengths and impact resistances and can be sterilised at temperatures as high as 140 C.
