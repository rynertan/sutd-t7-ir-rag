## Description
The present invention relates to a process for preparing α methylstyrene acrylonitrile copolymers, andmore particularly to a process for preparing a copolymer having excellent transparency, heat resistance andstrength in high conversions by copolymerizing α methylstyrene and acrylonitrile with or without at least oneother vinyl compound in the presence of a specific peroxide in a suspension or bulk polymerization manner. For producing a copolymer having a heat resistance sufficient for practical use by copolymerizing α methylstyrene,acrylonitrile and at least one of other vinyl compounds copolymerizable therewith such asstyrene, methyl methacrylate, vinyl toluene and t butylstyrene, it is necessary to employ α methylstyrene inan amount of at least 10 by weight, preferably at least 20 by weight, of the whole monomers to beused to produce a copolymer containing at least 10 by weight, preferably at least 20 by weight, of theα methylstyrene units. It is known to carry out a suspension or bulk polymerization in the presence of an organic peroxide as apolymerization initiator such as t butyl perbenzoate, t butyl peracetate or di t butyl peroxide in a process forpreparing α methylstyrene acrylonitrile copolymers wherein a large amount of α methylstyrene is employedto produce a copolymer having a good heat resistance from the above mentioned point of view. However, ina process using such initiators, it is necessary to use a large amount of the initiators regardless of thepolymerization temperature. Consequently, the obtained copolymer is very low in the degree of polymerization,namely molecular weight, and is poor in utility as a molding material. On the other hand, in case ofusing these initiators in a decreased amount for the purpose of raising the degree of polymerization, theproductivity is very low, since the so called dead end polymerization occurs, thus a high conversion asrequired in industrial production is not obtained, or a very long polymerization time is required when a highconversion is desired. Also, high conversions are not obtained by the use of a usual organic peroxide such as benzoylperoxide, even if the polymerization temperature optimum for the peroxide is adopted. Like this, in a conventional process for the preparation of the a methylstyrene acrylonitrile copolymersby suspension or bulk polymerization, the copolymers utilizable as molding materials have not beenobtained, or the productivity has been very low. It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing α methylstyrene acrylonitrilecopolymers having excellent transparency, heat resistance and strength. A further object of the invention is to provide a process for preparing α methylstyrene acrylonitrilecopolymers having excellent properties in high conversions in a short period of time by a suspension orbulk polymerization technique. These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent from the description hereinafter. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a process for preparing a copolymer whichcomprises copolymerizing 10 to 80 by weight of α methylstyrene, 5 to 50 by weight of acrylonitrileand 0 to 70 by weight of at least one member selected from the group consisting of styrene, methylmethacrylate, vinyl toluene and t butylstyrene in the presence of a difunctional organic peroxide as aninitiator at a temperature of 80 to 120 C. in a suspension or bulk polymerization manner, said difunctionalorganic peroxide being di t butyl peroxyhexahydroterephthalateand being employed in an amount of 0.1 to 2.0 by weight based on the total weight of themonomers used. In the present invention, there is employed a monomer mixture consisting of 10 to 80 by weight,preferably 20 to 80 by weight, of α methylstyrene, 5 to 50 by weight, preferably 10 to 40 byweight, of acrylonitrile and 0 to 70 by weight of at least one member selected from the group consistingof styrene, methyl methacrylate, vinyl toluene and t butylstyrene. It is essential to employ difunctional organic peroxides as polymerization initiators. The term difunctional peroxides as used herein means peroxides having two O Difunctional organic peroxides having a 10 hour half life temperature of 60 to 110 C. are employed inthe present invention. The term 10 hour half life temperature as used herein means the temperature atwhich 10 hours are required in reducing the concentration of an initiator by half by the thermal decomposition. The initiator is employed in an amount of 0.1 to 2.0 by weight, preferably 0.2 to 1.5 by weight,based on the total weight of the monomers used. When the amount of the initiator is less than 0.1 byweight, no industrially practical conversion is obtained, or a very long time is required in polymerization,thus resulting in lowering of productivity. When the amount is more than 2.0 by weight, a copolymer isobtained in high conversions in a short time, but the molecular weight is low and accordingly the strength of moldings made thereof is remarkably lowered. The fact that the α methylstyrene acrylonitrile copolymers of high quality are obtained in high conversionsin a very short time by a suspension or bulk polymerization using the specific difunctional organicperoxide has not been expected from conventional knowledges and techniques. However, the reason isunclear. Known suspension and bulk polymerization techniques are applicable to the process of the presentinvention. In the case of the suspension polymerization, known dispersing agents are added to an aqueousmedium. The dispersing agents include, for instance, organic dispersing agents such as polyvinyl alcohol,polyvinyl pyrrolidone and methy cellulose, and inorganic dispersing agents such as calcium phosphate,magnesium phosphate, sodium silicate, zinc oxide and magnesium carbonate. In the case of the inorganicdispersing agents, the combination use thereof with anionic surface active agents such as sodiumdodecylbenzensulfonate and sodium α olefinsulfonates is effective in increasing the dispersing effect. It is important to select the polymerization temperature. The polymerization is carried out at atemperature of 80 to 120 C., preferably 90 to 110 C.When the temperature is lower than 80 C., theconversion is low, and when the temperature is higher than 120 C., the molecular weight of the producedpolymer is lowered and industrially useful copolymers are hard to obtain. The present invention is more specifically described and explained by means of the followingExamples, in which all and parts are by weight unless otherwise noted. It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the Examples. In the Examples, the specific viscosity η An autoclave equipped with a stirrer was charged with 110 parts of water, 0.24 part of calciumphosphate, 0.003 part of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and 0.2 part of sodium chloride. To the autoclavewere added 50 parts of α methylstyene in which 0.3 part of di t butyl peroxyhexahydroterephthalate wasdissolved, 30 parts of acrylonitrile and 20 parts of styrene with stirring. Immediately, the temperature waselevated to 95 C., and the polymerization was carried out for 7 hours at that temperature. After cooling thereaction mixture to 40 C., the dehydration and drying were conducted to give a copolymer. The conversion, the specific viscosity of the copolymer and the deflection temperature and impactstrength of the molding made of the copolymer are shown in Table 1. The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that di t butyl peroxyhexahydroterephthalate wasemployed in an amount of 0.5 part. The results are shown in Table 1. The procedure of Example 1 was repeated except that 0.3 part of benzoyl peroxide was employedinstead of 0.3 part of di t butyl peroxyhexahydroterephthalate. The results are shown in Table 1. A copolymer was prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 except that 30 parts of α methylstyrene,10 parts of acrylonitrile and 60 parts of styrene were copolymerized in the presence of 1part of di t butyl peroxyhexahydroterephthalate. The conversion was 98.2 , thus the copolymer was obtained in a high conversion in a short time. Also, the deflection temperature was 118 C. The procedure of Example 4 was repeated except that 1.0 part of benzoyl peroxide was employedinstead of 1.0 part of di t butyl peroxyhexahydroterephthalate was employed and the polymerization wascarried out at 90 C. The conversion was very low, namely 42 . In addition to the ingredients used in the Examples, other ingredients can be used in the Examples asset forth in the specification to obtain substantially the same results.
