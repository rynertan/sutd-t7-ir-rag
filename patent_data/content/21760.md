# Reheat furnace skid and method of installation.

## Abstract
A reheat furnace work support skid 10 has a rail 14, 16 extending from precise locations on each of its opposite sides. A sectioned insulating refractory cover 32,34 is suspended on the skid by metal hangers 36 which rest slidably on the rails. The rails 14, 16 extend the full length of the portion of the skid 10 to be insulated. A method is disclosed in which the rails 14, 16 are positioned accurately on opposite sides of the skid 10 while the skid 10 is outside of the reheat furnace, whereafter the skid 10 is installed in the furnace where the refractory cover 32, 34 can be attached quickly and easily at proper locations anywhere along the length of the skid 10 without requiring welding inside the furnace.
