# Pipeline plough.

## Abstract
The plough has a front and a rear lifting assembly 60, 62 each including an arm 64, 80 which is extensible and angularly adjustable by hydraulic rams 65, 68 81, 84 . The arms carry rollers 74, 76, 78 94, 96, 98 upon which the pipeline 110 is lifted by the arms. The plough can be positioned beneath the pipeline as the arms retract while supporting the pipeline as the plough approaches the pipeline from one side. Having been positioned, the plough advances to cut a trench, the pipeline being supported in yielding manner by the two arms, having their lifting rams 68, 84 connected to hydraulic accumulators. Pressurised gas in the accumulators maintains the rollers 74, 76 94, 96 in contact with the pipeline as the plough moves up and down and pitches relatively to the pipeline, during ploughing. The plough requires no structure over the pipeline. The plough body 12 is not required to comprise parts which separate to allow positioning of the plough of the plough in relation to the pipeline.
