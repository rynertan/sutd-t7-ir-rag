# Electrical component comprising an electric circuit element having leads which are centered with respect to the walls of a housing.

## Abstract
An electrical component comprising an electric circuit element having two mutually parallel external leads which are directed parallel to the end faces of the circuit element which element is secured in a housing which is open on one side by means of an electrically insulating material, having the par ticularity that two pairs of resilient lugs extend from side walls of the housing. The lugs of each respective pair converge inwardly and clamp a respective external lead of the circuit element in such a position that the leads are centred with respect to the walls of the housing.
