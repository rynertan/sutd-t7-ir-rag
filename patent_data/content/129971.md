# Engine control systems.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a method of engine control, which comprises firing a weak spark through the spark gap, measuring the current through or voltage across the elec trodes following the weak spark, analysing the voltage or current to derive a prediction of the flame propagation speed and subsequently firing a stronger spark through the spark gap to ignite the charge, the timing of the stronger spark being varied in dependence upon the prediction of the flame prop agation speed.
