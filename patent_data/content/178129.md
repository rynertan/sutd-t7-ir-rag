# Apparatus for and method of regulating the shape of a focused ion beam.

## Abstract
An apparatus for regulating the shape of a focused ion beam comprises a deflect. 5 for irradiating a mask 16 which consists of a substrate 14 and a pattern 3 formed thereon with an ion beam from an ion supply source 4 , cir cuitry 5, 6, 7 for scanning the mask with the ion beam in XY directions and a mass analyser 8 for separating a first type of secondary ions which occur in the surface of the substrate due to said ion beam from a second type of secondary ions which occur in the surface of the pattern due to the ion beam. Detec tors 9, 10 detect the intensity of each of the two types of secondary ions and comparators 11, 12 compare detected signals which represent the intensities, with a predetermined value. A display device 13 displays an image of the substrate and an image of the pattern, these images being visually dis tinct in operation the spot shape of the ion beam is corrected with an astigmatic correction electrode 16 and an object lens 15 while observing the shape of the overlapping portions of the images.
