## Abstract
In a cover and frame assembly of the kind comprising a frame 25, 65 adapted to be embedded in the ground and affording an access opening 40 , and a cover 10, 60 adapted to be received in the frame 25, 65 , the cover 10, 60 or the frame 25, 65 has a resiliently biased locking member 56, C and the frame 25, 65 or cover 10, 60 respectively, a trip element 50, 70 , the trip element being positioned on the frame 25, 65 or cover 10, 60 and being of such configura tion that as the cover 10, 60 is moved to a closed position in the frame 25, 65 , the locking member 56, C is engaged by the trip element 50, 70 and is first displaced against the resilient force thereof from an unstressed position and then, when the cover 10, 60 is closed, permitted to return towards said unstressed position by the resilience thereof to engage a holding member 55, 75 to lock the cover 10, 60 in said closed position.
