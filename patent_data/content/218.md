## Description
PROCESS FOR THE ISOLATION OF 1,4,7,10,13,16 HEXAOXACYCLOOCTADE CANE The invention relates to a process for the isolation of 1,4,7,10,13,16 hexaoxacyclooctadecane from a mixture also containing one or more other macrocyclic polyethers. Hereinafter 1,4,7,0,13,16 hexaoxacyclooctadecane will also be referred to by its trivial name 18 crown 6 . Its structural formula is shown on the Formula page compound 9 . 18 Crown 6 can be prepared by heating tetraethylene glycol and bis 2 chloroethyl ether in the presence of tetrahydrofuran as a solvent and potassium hydroxide, see Synthesis 1976, 515 516. The reaction mixture thus formed contains 18 crown 6, potassium chloride, water and by products, i.a.macrocyclic polyethers having a ring of larger size than 18 crown 6. The solvent was evaporated from the reaction mixture to give a brown slurry to which dichloromethane was added. The potassium chloride was filtered off from the solution thus obtained, the filtrate was dried MgS04 , the solvent was evaporated from the dried filtrate to yield a residue of crude 18 crown 6. This residue was distilled to give a discoloured distillate containing 18 crown 6. This distillate was dissolved in acetonitrile and the solution was cooled to 45 C. The resultant precipitate of 18 crown 6 acetonitrile complex was collected by filtration. Distillation of this complex gave a distillate of pure 18 crown 6. A disadvantage of this procedure is that the 18 crown 6 is distilled twice and that expensive measures must be taken to prevent the occurrence of powerful and destructive explosions during these distillations, see Chemical BR Fngineering News , September 6, 1976, page 5 and December 13, 1976, page 5. Moreover the 18 crown 6 is obtained in a fairly low yield. The Applicants have found a process for the isolation of 18 crewn 6 in which the 18 crown 6 is obtained in high yield and need not be distilled, thus avoiding the explosions mentioned hereinbefore. Accordingly the invention provides a process for the isolation of 1,4,7,10,13,16 hexaoxacyclooctadecane from a mixture also containing one or more other macrocyclic polyethers, characterized by reacting the 1,4,7,10,13,16 hexaoxa cyclooctadecane with nitromethane in the presence of a solvent for the said macrocyclic polyethers, to precipitate a complex of 1,4,7,10,13, 16 hexaoxacyclooctadecane and nitromethane, separating precipitated complex from the mixture containing the complex, dissociating separated complex and separating the components from each other. Surprisingly, nitromethane is selective in that, when contacted with a mixture containing 18 crown 6 and one or nore other macrocyclic polyethers, it only forms a complex with 18 crown 6. Hence, the 18 crown 6 nitromethane complex obtained according to the invention does not or hardly contain macrocyclic polyethers other than 18 crown 6 As the 18 crown 6 nitromethane complex gives off nitromethane vapour the complex can simply be dissociated into 18 crown 6 and nitromethane by allowing it to stand in the open air. The complex is rapidly dissociated by heating it at subatmospheric pressure and removing tc.e nitroethne vapour formed, leaving pure or almost pure 18 crown 6.Heating may take place at a temperature of, for example, 35 C to 125 C at a pressure of, for example, 5 to 1500 Pa. The process according to the invention .tet be carried out ia a solvent for macrocyclic polyethers in dh.ch the 18 crown 6 nitromethane complex can be precipitated. Such a solvent may substantially consist of nitromethane. A solvent is taken to consist substantially of a specified compound when the content of this specified compound in the solvent is higher than 50 w. According to a feature of the invention the solvent sub stantially consists of an ether. Preferred ethers are dialkyl ethers and cyclic ethers. Examples of dialkyl ethers are diethyl ether, di n butyl ether and di n hexylether. The 18 crown 6 nitromethane complex is considerably less soluble in diethyl ether than in nitromethane at the same temperature, so that a considerably larger part of the 18 crown 6 present in the starting mixture can be isolated. Attractive examples of the cyclic ethers are 1,4 dioxane and tetrahydrofuran. According to another feature of the invention the solvent substantially consists of an alkanol, a hydrocarbon or a mixture of hydrocarbons or water. Examples of suitable alkanols are those having in the range of from one to five carbon atoms, for example methanol, ethanol, 2 propanol and tert butano . Examples of suitable hydrocarbons are benzene, toluene, te three xylenes and heptane. Particularly attractive solvents are methanol and benzene. 18 Crown 6, dissolved in water may be removed therefrom by reaction with nitromethane to form a precipitate of the 18 crown 6 nitromethane complex in r. tro methane containing water. Mixtures of solvents may be used, for example of diethyl ether and ethanol. The 18 crown 6 acetonitrile complex is very difficult to precipitate from the solvents mentioned in the last three paragraphs, if at all, as this complex is too highly soluble in these solvents. The reaction between 18 crown 6 and nitromethane is preferably carried out at a temperature in the range of from 25 0C to 35 0C, and, when the solvent substantially consists of nitromethane, of from 0 C to 25 C, so as to unable a very large part of the 18 crown 6 to be isolate. Mbere he solvent substantially consists of an ether, an alkanol, a hydrocarbon or a mixture of hydrocarbons or water, the reaction between 18 crown 6 and nitromethane is very suitably carried out at a temperature in the range of from OOC to 350C.Ambient temperature, for example, a temperature between 15 C and 250C, is very suitable. The 18 crown 6 nitromethane complex can easily be separated from the mixture containing the complex, for example by filtration, centrifugation or decantation. The 18 crown 6 nitromethane complex contains two molecules of nitromethane per molecule of 18 crown 6. Accordingly, the 18 crown 6 is reacted with nitromethane using a molar ratio of nitromethane to 18 crown 6 of at least 2 1. Preferably, this molar ratio is not higher than 20 1. This range is not critical, molar ratios of nitromethane to 18 crown 6 outside this range may be used, if desired. The 18 crown 6 nitromethane complex may be precipitated in any suitable manner, for example by adding nitromethane to the starting mixture and, if desired, cooling the mixture thus obtained to a suitable temperature, or by dissolving the starting mixture in diethyl ether and adding nitromethane at ambient temperature to the solution obtained, or by dissolving the starting mixture in any other of the above mentioned solvents, for example methanol, adding nitromethane and, if desired, cooling the mixture obtained to a suitable temperature. The starting mixture may be solid or liquid at the temperature at which the 18 crown 6 is reacted with nitromethane. The 18 crown 6 in the starting mixture may have been formed by any process. Very good results have been obtained by reacting tetraethylene glycol with a bis 2 haloethyl ether, halo representing chloro, bromo or iodo, in the presence of an alkali metal hydroxide. If desired, the alkali metal halide formed and solvent, if present, may be removed from the reaction mixture obtained, leaving the 18 crown 6 containing starting mixture. Other examples of processes for the preparation of 18 crown 6 are 1 Elimination of hydrogen chloride from 17 chloro 3,6,9,12,15 pentaoxaheptadecanol, followed by ring closure, in the presence of potassium tert butoxide, see British patent specification 1,285,367. 2 Catalytic oligomerization of ethylene oxide, see German Offenlegungsschrift 2,401,126. 3 Reaction of triethylene glycol with 3,6 dioxa 1,8 di chlorooctane in the presence of potassium hydroxide and 10 aqueous tetrahydrofuran, as described il J.Org.Chem. 39 1974 2445 2446. The invention will now be illustrated by reference te the following Examples.Preparation of crude 18 crown 6 A 3 litre three necked round bottomed flask, fitter with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser and a 250 ml dropping funnel was charged with potassium hydroxide pellets 416 g.containing 6.3 mol KoH , tetraethylene glycol 1.25 mol ind tetrahydrofuran 1000 ml . The reaction vessel was placed in a heating mantle and gently heated. After 15 minutes a solution of bis 2 chloroethyl ether 3.125 mol in tetrahydrofuran 150 ml was added in one stream from the Åaropping unr el to the vigorously stirred reactants. The reaction mixture was then heated under reflux, with stirring for 18 hours. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was cooled and the solvent was removed under a pressure of 1.9 kPa to give a brown slurry to which dichloromethane 750 ml was added.The resulting suspension of potassium chloride was filtered and the potassium chloride filtered off was washed with dichloromethane l00 ml .The combined filtrate and washings were dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate and the solvent was evaporated at a pressure of 1.9 kPa to give a residue of crude 18 crown 6 396 g containing 0.531 mol of 18 crowr 6 yield 42.5 , ealcuaed.un starting tetraethylene glycol , potassium chloride and at least eight other compounds among which 1,4,7,10,13,16, 19,22,25,28,31, 34 dodecaoxacyclohexatria contane, hexaethyleneglycol and unreacted tetraethylene glycol.This crude 18 crown 6 was used as described hereinafter.EXAMPLE I Isolation of 18 crown 6 in nitromethane at 200C Crude 18 crown 6 3.021 g , prepared as described above, was dissolved in nitromethane 4 ml . The solution formed was cooled to 20 C and the 18 crown 6 nitromethane complex precipitated was filtered off 1.248 g . The complex was kept for 30 minutes at 70 C and a pressure of 13 Pa, leaving 18 crown 6 in a yield of 37X calculated on starting tetraethylene glycol, or 87Z calculated on 18 crown 6 in the crude 18 crown 6. The purity of the 18 crown 6 was higher than 99.52. Comparative Experiment A Isolation of 18 crown 6 in acetonitrile at 20 C Crude 18 crown 6 3.021 g , prepared as described above, was dissolved in acetonitrile 4 ml . The solution formed was cooled to 200C and the 18 crown 6 acetonitrile complex was filtered off. The complex was kept for 30 minutes at 70 0C and a pressure of 13 Pa, leaving 18 crown 6 in a yield of 27Z calculated on starting tetraethylene glycol, or 63Z calculated on 18 crown 6 in the crude 18 crown 6. Comparison withExample I shows that complexation with nitromethane allows the 18 crown 6 in a much higher yield.Comparative Experiment B Isolation of 18 crown 6 in acetonitrile at 450C This experiment is according to the process desoribed in Synthesis 1976, 515 516. Crude 18 crown 6 39.6 g , prepared as described above, was distilled at a pressure of 20 Pa to give a distillate 21.3 g boiling at 140 2100C. This distillate was mixed with acetonitrile 53 ml at 20 C and the mixture formed was cooled to 45 C. The resultant 18 crown 6 acetonitrile complex was filtered off and subjected to distillation at a pressure of 2 Pa to give a distillate of 18 crown 6 in a yield of 25 calculated n starting tetraethylene glycol, or 595 calculated on 18 crown 6 in the crude 18 crown 6. Comparison withExample I shows that complexation with nitromethane at 200C allows the 18 crown 6 in a much higher yield than complexation with acetonitrile at 45 C followed by distillation of 18 crown 6.EXAMPLE II Isolation of 18 crown 6 in nitromethane at 200C Crude 18 crown 6 3.04 g , prepared as described above, was mixed with nitromethane 5ml at 20do. After 16 hours the precipitate formed was filtered off and kept for 30 minutes at 70 0C and a pressure of 13 Pa, leaving 18 crown 6 in a yield of 28 calculated on starting tetraethylene glycol, or 66X calculated on 18 crown 6 in the crude 18 crown 6. Comparison of this yield with the higher yield obtained in Example I shows the favourable influence of the temperature of 200C when nitromethane is used as the solvent.EXAMPLE III Isolation of 18 crown 6 in diethyl ether at 200C Crude 18 crown 6 3.5 g , prepared as described above, was extracted with four 20 ml portions of diethyl ether. The residue of potassium chloride thus obtained was filtered off, the four filtrates were combined, and the solvent was evaporated. Then, a mixture of nitromethane 0.7 ml and 5.1 ml of diethyl ether was added at 200C, which caused an immediate precipi tation of the 18 crown 6 nitromethane complex. The complex precipitated was filtered off and kept for 30 minutes at 700C and a pressure of 13 Pa, leaving 18 crown 6 in a yield of 37Z calculated on starting tetraethylene glycol, or 87Z calculated on 18 crown 6 in the crude 18 crown 6. Comparison of this yield with the lower yield of Example II shows the favourable influence of the diethyl ether.EXAMPLE IV Isolation of 18 crown 6 in methanol at 20 C Crude 18 crown 6 3.16 g , prepared as described above, was mixed with nitromethane 0.6 ml and methanol 4.4 ml at 20 C. After i6 hours the precipitate formed was filtered off and kept for 30 minutes at 70 C and a pressure of 13 Pa, leaving 18 crown 6 in a yield of 13 , calculated on starting tetraethylene glycol, or 31 , calculated on 18 crown 6 in the crude 18 crown 6. Comparison of this yield with the higher yields obtained in the Examples II and III shows that in this case diethyl ether and nitromethane are more attractive solvents than methanol. EX PLE V Separation of 18 crown 6 from macrocyclic polyether No. 3 in diethyl ether Nitromethane 0.6 ml was added at 200C to a solution of 18 crown 6 1.13 mmol and macrocyclic polyether No. 3 of the formula page 1.15 mmol in diethyl ether 6 ml . The precipitate formed was filtered off, washed at 20 C with 1 ml of a diethyl ec her nitromethane 10 1 v v mixture and dried with dry air at 20 C. The dried precipitate was the 18 crown 6 nitromethane complex. The complex contained 92 of the starting amount of 18 crown 6 and the molar ratio of 18 crown 6 to macrocyclic polyether No. 3 in the dried precipitate was 97 3. The complex was kept for 30 minutes at 700C and a pressure of 13 Pa leaving 18 crown 6 containing 3X macrocyclic polyether No. 3. EXMPLES VI to XI Precipitation of the 18 crown 6 nitro methane complex in various solvents Nitromethane 1.48 mmol was added to a solution of 18 crown 6 0.19 mmol and macrocyclic polyether No. 3 of the formula page 0.19 mmol in a solvent t1 ml at 250C.The 18 crown 6 nitromethane complex precicitateq was filtered off.The filtered material was kept fer 30 min es 4 TOC and a pressure of 13 Pa, which caused dissociatinn into nitromethane, which was sucked off, and 18 crown 6. Then, the 18 crown 6 was weighed and the yield of it on the starting amount of 18 crown 6 was calculated. Six solvents were tested in this manner. Table I presents the results. The purity of the 18 crown 6 was 99 in each of the Examples.

The 18 crowo 6 acetonitrile complex crystallized out immediately and was filtered off. It contained 40 of the starting amount of 18 crown 6.Comparison with Example VI shows that nitro methane had complexed a much larger part of the 18 crown 6 har acetonitrile. The purity of the 18 crown 6 was more than S9.Comparative Experiments D to H Attempted precipitation of the 18 crown 6 acetonitrile complex in five solvents The experiments of Examples VII to XI were carried out with acetonitrile 1.71 mmol instead of nitromethane 1.15 umoio. In none of the five experiments was a precipitate formed.Comparative Experiments I to P Attempted preparation of complexes of nitromethane with macrocyclic polyethers other than 18 crown 6 These eight comparative experiments were carried out with the macrocyclic polyethers listed in Table II.
