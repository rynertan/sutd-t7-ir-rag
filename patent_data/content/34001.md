# IC chip mounting assembly and a method of manufacturing such assembly.

## Abstract
An IC chip mounting assembly comprises a lead frame providing a heat sink 3 and leads 4, 5, 6 , and a housing 2 moulded on to the lead frame and providing a cavity 7 in which the chip 11 is received, the housing 2 having a wall 9 formed on the heat sink 3 with an aperture 10 in the wall 9 to receive and locate the chip 11 . The wall 9 is also formed with a number of solder wells 13 in communication with the aperture 10 , which solder wells 13 receive any excess sol der 12 when the chip 11 is bonded to the heat sink 3 , such bonding being carried out with the use of an induction heating apparatus.
