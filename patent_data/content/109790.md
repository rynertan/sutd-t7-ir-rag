# APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING THE OUTFLOW OF GAS FROM A PROPELLANT AUGMENTED, PRESSURIZED GAS DISPENSING DEVICE

## Abstract
A propellant augmented, pressurized gas dispensing device includes a high pressure gas chamber, a propellant chamber and a flow passage placing the two chambers in fluid communication. A valve is associated with the flow passage for allowing bidirectional flow between the cham bers at differing flow rates. The valve allows relatively rapid flow from the propellant chamber into the gas chamber while restricting the flow from the gas chamber.
