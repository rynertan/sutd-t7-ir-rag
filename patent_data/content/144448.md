# METHOD OF MANUFACTURING PERMANENT MAGNETIC FIELD ROTOR.

## Abstract
A permanent magnetic field rotor 10 has a plurality of radially arranged permanent magnets 18 and a yoke 19 constituted by a large number of sheet elements 20 which are inserted between adjacent permanent magnets 18 and are laminated. The method of manufacturing the permanent magnetic field rotor includes a step of laminating a large number of thin plate members 25 of the same shape which each have a plurality of radially arranged yoke element portions 26 of a substantially fan shape and connection portions 27 connecting together the outer peripheral edge portions of adjacent yoke element portions 26 , so as to define a permanent magnet receiving groove 29 between adjacent yoke element portions 26 . When the permanent magnets 18 are each received in a permanent magnet receiving groove 29 of the laminated thin plate members 25 , the laminated thin plate members 25 are firmly secured to each other. Therefore, each of the connection portions 27 of the laminated thin plate members 25 is cut off, in the lamination direction of the thin plate members 25 , over a width which is smaller than the corresponding permanent magnet 18 . Thus, the yoke 19 is constituted by sheet elements 20 which are separated from each other on either side of each permanent magnet 18 .
