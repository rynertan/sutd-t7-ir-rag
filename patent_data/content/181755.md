# Method for holding a moving film.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to a method for holding a moving film comprising bringing the surfaces of a set of conductive rolls 12,13 12a, 12b, 12c, 13a, 13b, 13c into contact with the front and back surfaces respectively of a moving film 11 , at least one of the surfaces of the set of rolls 12, 13 12a, 12b, 12c, 13a, 13b, 13c being constructed of an elastomer, and holding the moving film 11 by the surfaces of the set of rolls 12, 13 12a, 12b, 12c, 13a, 13b, 13c while establishing a high electric potential difference between the rolls of the set of rolls 12, 13 12a, 12b, 12c, 13a, 13b, 13c . The present invention provides a useful method for conveying or stretching the film 11 at high speed without operational troubles, thereby providing a strong film free from scratches or foreign particles on the surface.
