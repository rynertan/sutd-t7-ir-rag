# Tissue processing apparatus.

## Abstract
A tissue processing apparatus comprises a processing chamber 1 , a plurality of reagent containers 5 , only one of which is illustrated, and a selector valve 2 for sequentially connecting the processing chamber 1 to each of the said reagent containers 5 to transfer fluid between the chamber and such a container. A vacuum compression pump 6 and a changeover valve system connected to each of the reagent containers 5 and to the processing chamber 1 is operable to promote reagent flow in a required direction between a reagent container 5 and a processing chamber 1 while maintaining a closed circuit for reagent and gas displaced by the pump between the chamber and the container.
