# Grain oriented electromagnetic steel sheet and method for its production.

## Abstract
A grain oriented electromagnetic steel sheet 1 with improved watt loss W17 50 and a method for its production is described, whereby steel sheet 1 , which has been subjected to final high temperature annealing in order to approximate the crystal orientation of the sheet in a 110 001 orientation is irradiated with a laser beam 2 . Thanks to the laser beam irradiation, regions of high dislocation density d are locally formed in the steel sheet 1 and thereby magnetic domains are subdivided, with the result that a low watt loss is activated.
