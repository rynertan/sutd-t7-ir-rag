## Description
N Aryl N 1,4,5,6 Tetrahydropyrimidin 2 yl or 4,5,6,7 tetrahydro l H 1,3 diazepin 2 yl Ureas for Intestinal Disorders and as AntihypertensivesField of InventionThis invention relates to a method for controlling hypertension, a method for relieving the symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome and a method for controlling diarrhea employing certain N aryl N 1,4, 5,6 tetrahydropyrimidin 2 yl or 4,5,6,7 tetrahydro l H 1,3 diazepin 2 yl ureas, to certain of said urea compounds per se, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing said urea compounds.Background of the Invention Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional disorder characterized primarily by abdominal pain, but also by diarrhea and constipation and like symptoms. It is believed that the pain associated with this syndrome is due to excessive sensitivity to distention of the bowel caused either by intestinal gas and or fecal material.Treatments which would provide relief from the discomforts associated with such symptoms and or the disorder which produce such symptoms are highly desirable.Brief Summary of the InventionThe present invention involves a method of reducing arterial pressure in hypertensive animals,a method for relieving the symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome and a method for controlling diarrhea in animals having said syndrome or in animals having diarrhea, respectively, by administering to said animal in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound, or a pharmaceuticallyacceptable salt thereof, having the formula EMI2.1 In the foregoing and subsequent formulas, Ar is a phenyl radical of the formula EMI2.2 wherein X is Br or C1, and Y is Br, C1 or CH3 and n is 0 or 1.This invention also involves, as compounds per se, the compound wherein X and Y are each C1 which is the most active compound for the above methods involving intestinal disorders, and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, and the compound and its salts wherein X is C1, and Y is CH3. This invention also embraces compositions, suitable for use in the above antihypertensive method, wherein the foregoing urea compound is in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The most preferred composition contains the compound wherein X and Y are eachC1, which is the most active antihypertensive compound, or its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The activities of the above compounds reside in the urea base so that useful acid addition salts may be from various acids provided only that the acids be pharmaceutically acceptable. Representative acid salts include hydrochloride, hydrobromide, phosphate, sulfate, P toluenesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, malonate, succinate, methosulfate, methanesulfonate, 2 napsylate and the like.Prior ArtCertain N aryl tetrahydropyrimidin 2 yl ureas are generically disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 3,168,520, but the only utility taught is in connection with dyeing, and no pharmaceutical utility is taught, nor is any of the compounds used in the present invention specifically disclosed.An article by G.

The article does not teach the antihypertensive activity, the activity as an antidiarrheal agent or in relieving the symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome for this 2,6 dimethylphenyl compound, which applicant found to exist. Prior ArtThe above article by G. H. Douglas, et al., ArzneimittelForschung., Vol. 28 II Supplement 8a, 1435 1441 1978 erroneously discloses as Compound 109 at p. 1438 in its tautomeric form the compound of the formula EMI4.1 which was disclosed to be active as a gastric acid antisecretory agent. The article does not teach the antihypertensive activity, the activity as an antidiarrheal agent or in relieving the symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome for this 2,6 dimethylphenyl compound, which applicant found to exist.The columns headed by R2 and R3 in Table 3 on p. 1438 of said article were transposed erroneously leading to the above structure, which was then disclosed in Chem Abstracts, 90, 48236s 1979 , where it was named in theChem.

The resulting solution of free base II is dried over a suitable drying agent such as Na2SO4 or K2C03. The dried solutions may either be used as such for reactions with aryl isocyanates to obtain products I or the extraction solvent may be evaporated in vacuo and the residual free base II taken up in a different organic solvent, e.g.,DMF, DMSO, and the like said solutions of II then being treated with an appropriate isocyanate III to afford the free base products I. Although the reactions of II withIII may be carried out with equimolar amounts of reac tants, usually a stoichiometric excess, generally of from about 0.25 1.0 mole of free base II to that of aryl isocyanate III is employed in order to minimize undesired side reactions such as, for example, formation of bis aryl isocyanate adducts with II. Temperature ranges for those reactions may conveniently range from about 200 to 700C. The products I, obtained in free base form, may conveniently be purified by dissolving in an organic solvent, immiscible with H20, such as CH2C12, washing with H20 to remove excess II, if any, followed by isolation of I from the solvent by drying, filtration from drying agent, and solvent removal.Alternatively, the reactions of II free base with III may be carried out by adding a solution of II HC1 in DMF,DMSO, and the like, to a stirring suspension of a stoichiometric amount of an alkali metal hydride such as LiH,NaH, and the like, LiH being preferred, which forms II free base, the corresponding alkali metal chloride, and H2 gas.The thus obtained solution of free base II the presence of the metal chloride does not interfere with the subsequent reaction is treated with an appropriate amount of aryl isocyanate III. When the reaction is complete, dilution with H20 or ice H20, in excess amounts, causes precipitation of crude product I and leaves any unreacted II in solution. Filtration then allows isolation of crudeI.Said I, in free base form, may be further purified, if necessary, by recrystallization and chromatographic techniques, and so forth, according to standard techniques known in the art. A further purification method may be used such as dissolution in dilute aqueous acid, such as HC1, most preferred, H2S04, HBr, HN03 and the like, filtration from any undissolved impurities, followed by neutralization with suitable inorganic bases such as sodium and potassium bicarbonates and carbonates and the like, dilute alkali metal hydroxides such as NaOH, KOH, and the like, and organic bases such as triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, and the like, which causes precipitation of I free base.The thus obtained free base I may then be purified by recrystallization, etc., as described above, or may be converted to a suitable pharmaceuticallyacceptable salt form of I which also may be purified by recrystallization or precipitation techniques well known in the art.Said pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms of I are generally comprised of I in combination with suitable mineral acids such as HC1 most preferred , HBr, H2SOk, H3P04, and strong organic acids such as benzenesulfonic, p toluenesulfonic, 1 and 2 naphthalenesulfonic, ethanedisulfonic, methane and ethanesulfonic methylsulfuric, and the like, being the most preferred. Although salts ofI with weaker acids, such as benzoic, fumaric, maleic, citric, etc. do form, they are relatively easily dissociated because of the relatively weak base strength of I.This dissociation may be caused by attempted drying in vacuo, dissolution in H20, etc. The ease of dissociation, however, may not necessarily preclude use of salts of this type in pharmaceutical formulations insofar as they remain stable enough to be purified by recrystallization, etc., and capable of being formulated into pharmaceutical preparations such as tablets, capsules, and the like.The preferred salt forms of I are additionally capable of forming hydrates and solvates with H20 and certain organic solvents, respectively. Also, I and its salt forms may exist in several tautomeric forms. It is naturally intended that the various hydrates, solvates, and tauto meric forms of I be included within the scope of this invention.The N aryl N 1,4,5,6 tetrahydropyrimidin 2 yl or 4,5,6,7 tetrahydro l H l,3 diazepin 2 yl i urea compounds have been found to be useful as anti diarrheal agents and to provide relief from the discomfort associated with functional intestinal disorders spoken of as irritable bowel syndrome. The disorder is characterized by abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation and like symptoms caused by excessive sensitivity to distension of the bowel by the presence of intestinal gas and or fecal material.The N substituted phenyl N 1,4,5,6 tetrahydropyrimidin 2 yl or 4,5,6,7 tetrahydro 1 H 1,3 diazepin 2 yl urea compounds useful in the present invention have been found to alleviate hypertension and further, to generally accomplish this without an accompanying increase in heart rate. The compounds most useful in the present invention do not show an increase in heart rate, but a lowering of heart rate and, generally, long duration. An agent which has an antihypertensive effect without increasing but rather maintaining or decreasing heart rate, is the one considered most useful for beneficially treating a hypertensive subject. The extent to which a compound possesses these properties may be primarily determined in the antihypertensive test hereinafter described.Rodent Antihypertensive Screen This test evaluates compounds for effects on arterial pressure and heart rate.In this test, the arterial pressure of adult spontaneously hypertensive rats SHR Charles River is monitored directly via an aortic cannula. Rats are anesthetized with an inhalation anesthetic methoxyflurane . The left carotid artery is isolated and cannulated. The tip of the cannula is advanced to the aorta and the cannula is exteriorized behind the neck at the level of the scapula.Animals are placed in individual cases and allowed to recover from the anesthetic and are kept unrestrained.The arterial cannula is connected to the pressure transducer which is attached to the recorder. Heart rate is determined from the arterial pressure recording. The test compounds are administered either orally p.o. by gavage or by intraperitoneal i.p. injection. The arterial pressure and heart rate are monitored for a minimum of 24 hours. A test compound is considered to be active as an antihypertensive agent if the mean arterial pressure MAP indicates a fall of 15 mm of Hg. Each animal serves as his own control.The results of this test employing at least 3 rats per dose level for each compound and performed with N aryl N 1,4,5,6 tetrahydropyrimidin 2 yl urea compounds are shown in Table I.The results seen in Tables 1A and 1B show that N substituted phenyl N 1,4,5,6 tetrahydropyrimidin 2 yl or 4,5,6,7 tetrahydro l H l,3 diazepin 2 yl urea compounds and their salts possess not only the beneficial antihypertensive property but also the desirable property of maintaining or lowering heart rate. The compounds used in the present invention are useful for treating hypertension high blood pressure by administer ing to subjects in need of treatment, a therapeuticallyeffective hypertension reducing amount of a N substituted phenyl N 1,4,5,6 tetrahydropyrimidin 2 yl or 4,5,6, 7 tetrahydro l H l, 3 diazepin 2 yl urea compound of Form ula I or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt as active agent. The active agents may be administered with or without carrier in the amounts hereinafter set forth. A pre ferred method of administration is by the use of pharmaceu tical compositions in unit dosage form as described below. The operable ranges for carrying out the treatment is the administration, orally or parenterally, of from about 1 milligram to about 500 milligrams of said N substituted phenyl N l,4,5,6 tetrahydropyrimidin 2 yl or 4,5,6,7 tetrahydro l H l,3 diazepin 2 yl J urea compound in dosage unit form. While the therapeutic method is most useful for human subjects, it may also be employed for other mammals.Operable amounts are generally within the range of from about 0.5 to 100 mg kg of body weight.

It is classified as a functional bowel disease.In practice, it is one of the major digestive disorders and is a leading cause of absenteeism from work and a reason for physician office visits. In modern usage, nirritable bowel syndrome is the preferred term for this condition.Pathophysiology Although the etiology is unknown, recent studies have elucidated characteristics of the pathophysiology of this condition. Alteration of colonic motility has been suggested as a mechanism of this syndrome. This is characterized by an increased basal activity, as well as a sensitivity to exogenous or endogenous stimuli. Since the symptoms many times are brought on by eating, it has been postulated that cholecystokinin, which is released from the small intestine after eating is partially responsible.Electrical recordings from the human colon have also shown that there is a difference in the characteristic slow wave frequency in patients with irritable bowel.Patients with irritable bowel syndrome have a lower pain threshold to distention than normal. Thus, they are much more sensitive to the distention caused by normal amounts of gas or fecal contents present in the colon. If the sensitivity to distention can be reduced, the pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome necessarily will be reduced. Irritable bowel appears to be unique to man and no naturally occurring disease similar to irritable bowel has been discovered in animals. In order to test compounds for possible activity in this state, the pathophysiologic characteristics of the disease must be utilized in designing animal experiments to test such compounds. The glass bead test described below has been developed to test for the effectiveness of compounds against one component of this disease state, that of response of the colon to distention, which could produce abdominal pain.Although no way of producing an increased sensitivity to distention of the bowel has been found in the mouse, stimulation by a greater than normal distending force is utilized. A drug interfering with this response to distention may be of use in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome if it has other characteristics which could provide efficacy.The glass bead test can also be used to evaluate antidiarrheal activity. Although most drugs producing constipation in man are effective in the glass bead test, many work by mechanisms which do not fulfill the characteristics of an agent which both decreases the response of an agent which both decreases the response to distention and effects abnormal motor activity. One example is that of narcotic analgesics which are effective in the glass bead test, but increase the phasic motor activity of the intestine and are not useful in irritable bowel. Other test models should, therefore, be used to confirm or further define the utility of any compound as an anti irritable bowel agent.One test to confirm the utility of compounds effective in the glass bead test, which may be used as an indicator of effectiveness for the diarrhea state produced by irritable bowel syndrome is the castor oil diarrhea test in mice or rats. A description of this test is given infra. The series of compounds for which there is claimed antiirritable bowel activity in fact are active against castor oil diarrhea, the effective doses correlating well with those which are effective in the glass bead test.Since there is no model for the constipation phase of this condition, the regularizing action of a compound cannot be examined. However, since constipation in irritable bowel syndrome is often secondary to diarrhea, one would expect that the prevention of diarrhea should alleviate the constipation phase.The Glass Bead Test The extent to which a compound is effective in providing relief from the symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome may be determined by a test in which a glass bead is inserted into the rectum and the lapse time between insertion and expulsion of the bead determined. Compounds which are effective in decreasing the sensitivity to distention of the colonic wall delays the expulsion of the bead. The test is carried out with male albino mice of 18 25 grams body weight using groups of five mice for each compound dose tested. The initial screen dose selected for all compounds is 50 milligrams per kilogram of body weight mg kg administered orally in a volume of 0.1 milliliter per 10 grams of body weight. The control groups receive the vehicle, 0.5 per cent methocel, used for both oral and intraperitoneal administration. The mice are fasted one hour before testing and the test drugs are given one hour prior to glass bead insertion.At the end of the pretreatment time, the mouse is picked up and held firmly in one hand with his abdomen facing the technician. The glass bead of 3 millimeters in diameter is positioned at the rectum and using a pinching action with a thumb and forefinger, the bead is pushed into the rectum. Then using a glass rod of 3 millimeters in diameter which has been lubricated with 0.5 per cent methocel to facilitate insertion, the glass bead is pushed up into the rectum a distance of 2 centimeters using a slow gentle turning motion. The mice are timed as a group using the last mouse inserted as zero time and the number of beads expelled in a group at different timed intervals are recorded. The groups are based on timed intervals of o to 5 minutes, 5 to 10 minutes, 10 to 20 minutes, 20 to 40 minutes, and greater than 40 minutes.They are given the activity index values of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Mice who have not expelled their beads by the 40minute cutoff time are examined for perforations. Those mice whose colons are perforated are eliminated from the group. The sum of the values divided by the number of mice or beads is termed the activity index for the drug tested. The ED50 is determined by regression lines using the method of last squares. The ED50 is arhitrarily assigned as that dose causing an activity index of 2. TheED2 is essentially equivalent to the ED50, with the activity being expressed on a scale of 0 to 4 in the GlassBead Test.The results of this test employing intraperitoneal and oral administration of N aryl N 1,4,5,6 tetrahydro pyrimidin 2 yl or 4,5,6,7 tetrahydro l H 1,3 diazepin 2 yl urea compounds are shown in Tables 2A and 2B.

The mice are fasted overnight before testing however, water is given ad lib. during fast. On the day of testing, the mice are weighed beforehand to obtain an average weight using an individual weight range of 5 gms.Drugs are administered by the desired route p.o., s.c., or i.p. suspended or dissolved in 0.5 per cent methocel using a volume of 1 ml 100 gm of average body weight 0.1 ml 10 gm to groups of five mice for each compound dose tested. Control mice receive the test vehicle. One hour after, a single dose of castor oil 0.3 ml per mouse is given orally to all groups. The mice are returned to their cages with access to food and water for the remainder of the experiment.Mice fasted overnight will have diarrhea usually within one hour after administration of castor oil. Observations for the presence of diarrhea are taken eve y hour for five hours. A positive or negative response is used. The absence of diarrhea is expressed in percent inhibition as compared to the incidence of diarrhea at that time period in the control group. ED501s are determined by calculation regression analysis using a least square method. The effect over the total duration of the experiment is used for this calculation.The foregoing results in Tables 2 A and 2 B illustrate the beneficial effect of N aryl N 1,4,5,6 tetrahydropyrimidin 2 yl or 4,5,6,7 tetrahydro l H 1,3 diazepin 2 yl lurea compounds in decreasing abnormal sensitivity to distention of bowel. These properties are utilized in the methods and compositions of the present invention. The process of the present invention, namely, a method for alleviating functional intestinal disorders and for treating the discomforts associated therewith comprises administering to subjects in need of treatment, a therapeutically effective amount of an N aryl N 1,4,5,6tetrahydropyrimidin 2 yl urea compound of Formula I or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt as active agent. The active agents may be administered with or without carrier in the amounts hereinafter set forth. A preferred method of administration is by use of pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form as described below.The operable ranges for carrying out the process is the administration, orally or parenterally, of from about 1 milligram to about 500 milligrams of an N aryl N 1,4,5,6 tetrahydropyrimidin 2 yl or 4,5,6,7 tetrahydro 1 H 1, 3 diazepin 2 yl urea compound in dosage unit form. While the therapeutic method is most useful for human subjects, it may also be employed for other mammals. Operable amounts are generally within the range of from about 0.50 to 100 mg kg. The outstanding properties are most effectively utilized by use of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention. The pharmaceutical compositions comprising an N aryl N l,4,5,6, tetrahydropyrimidin 2 yl urea compound or acid addition salt thereof, as the active ingredient, may be prepared by intimately mixing the urea compound with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral. In preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed.Thus, for liquid oral preparations, such as for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions, suitable carriers and additives include water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like for solid oral preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules and tablets, suitable carriers and additives include starches, sugars, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are employed. If desired, tablets may be sugarcoated or enteric coated by standard techniques. For parenterals, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, though other ingredients, for example, for purposes such as aiding solubility or for preservation, may be included.Injectable suspensions may also be prepared, in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. The term dosage unit form as used in the specification and claims herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier.
