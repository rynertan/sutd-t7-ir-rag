# A PACKAGING METHOD AND A DEVICE THEREFOR

## Abstract
A method of forming a form stable, preferably product contour tight package in a roller operated packaging machine. A thermoformable web 14 is pre heated to a suitable forming temperature and the web is thereafter supplied to a mould tray 20 . The tray is provided with vacuum passages and or other arrangements for forced forming to the contour of the tray. A sealing tool 22 surrounds, completely or partly, the periphery of the tray and is used for sealing of the second web to the first one. The heat of the sealing tool is superposed, primarily by heat radiation, onto the cooling, preferably such that a boarder region 26 heat cold is created in the marginal portion of the mould tray.
