# Method of and device for determining the distribution of radiation attenuation in a body section.

## Abstract
Using the method and device for computer tomography in accordance with the invention, always fhe same filtering opera tion can be pertormed for image reconstruction, regardless of the method used to measure the measurement data parallel whether equidistant or not or divergent whether equiangular or not , provided that before and after the filtering of the mea surement data there is performed a multiplication by a pre conditioning factor and a post conditioning factor, respective ly. The pre conditioning and post conditioning factors are de pendent on the type of reconstruction and on the position of a measurement data value in the group of measurement data fil tered or to be filtered. The fact that the same filter can be used is important notably for computer tomography apparatus in which the convolution filter is embodied in an electronic cir cuit by means of hardware . The back projection device of a device in accordance with the invention is suitable for the back projection of measurement data along either divergent measurement paths or parallel measurement paths for which it requires only the modification of a few constants applied to the back projection device.
