# Method of bonding sheet materials to form wraps.

## Abstract
A method of making a bond structure and a bond structure are provided that produce concurrently a peel bond and a lap bond. One end 2 of a sheet 1 to be joined to a second end 7 of the same or other sheet 6 is folded back on itself 3, 4 and one end 7 et the other member 6 inserted. The two pairs of contacting surfaces thus formed are subsequently bonded to each other. The bonding may be by any means and the clamping force across the bond during bonding need be applied from one side of the sheet only. By insuring that the peel bond fails before the material, a flat lap bond may be achieved by causing only the peel bond to fail.
