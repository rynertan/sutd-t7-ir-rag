# Geophysical exploration system.

## Abstract
A system is provided for collecting and interpreting data indicative of the condition of a geological structure. The system comprises a plurality of geophone sensors 221 , in the form of structural moment detectors, and electronic circuitry 222 for processing and manipulating signals derived from the sensors 221 . In use the sensors 221 are fixed in position such as to preferentially detect seismic disturbances in pre selected directions. In one embodiment, at least some of the electronic circuitry 222 associated with each geophone sensor sensor 221 is provided in the same housing as the sensor to form a unitary device termed a structural information detector.
