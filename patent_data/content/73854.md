# Fibrous materials.

## Abstract
The fibrous material is for the preparation of a sheet material containing large amounts of inorganic fine powders or inorganic short fibers by a usual paper making method. A raw material for forming the fibrous material is previously impregnated with a polymer flocculant of the polyacrylamide type or the like in the amount of 0.01 to 5 dry solids . The fibrous material is adaptable for sheets which can be prepared easily by individuals at home as well as at factories. The fibrous material can be utilized for a wide range of application, for example, for various ceramic products, construction materials, papers for special use, filters and so on and for recovery of solids from waste water or the like.
