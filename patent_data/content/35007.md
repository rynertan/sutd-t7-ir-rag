# Method and apparatus for collecting and handling mineral fibres.

## Abstract
A method and an apparatus for collecting and handling partly fibrated material which is formed by a partial fibrating of a mineral bloom 1 , whereby the partially fibrated material is collected and brought into suspension in a water bath 11 in which the un fibrated material is separated and the fibrated material is collected and removed for the manufacture of mineral fibre products. In the water bath 11 the fibre fraction and the partially fibrated material is kept in water suspension by 12 whereas un fibrated and more heavy material is allowed to sink to the bottom from which such material is removed by 13 . The collecting of the fibre material just formed is preferably made by flows of water 6,7 and while suspending the fibre material in air by 38,40 . The separation of fibre material is made by dynamical separation in one or several stages.
