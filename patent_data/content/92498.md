## Description
TREAD REINFORCEMEHT ,TF UCTURE FOR PNEUMATIC TIRES Background of the Invention The present invention relates to pneumatic tires, and more particularly to tread reinforcement structures for pneumatic tires. The present invention relates to a tread reinforcement structure for a pneumatic tire, wherein one treadreinforcing ply is folded around a second tread reinforcing ply. The tread reinforcing elements of the second treadreinforcing ply are oriented at a substantially zero degree angle with respect to the mid circumferential plane of the tire. Tread reinforcement structures for radial tires having one tread reinforcing ply folded around another tread reinforcing ply are well known in the tire, design and manufacturing technologies. Such tread reinforcement structures are known to have the advantages of improved high speed performance characteristics and improved resistance to separations at the axial edges of the treadreinforcement structure.For instance, U. S, Patent 3,093,181, issued to Beckadolph, teaches that a first tread reinforcing ply, in which the reinforcing elements are substantially perpendicular to the mid circumferential plane of a tire, may be folded around a second treadreinforcing ply having its reinforcing elements oriented at a substantially,zero degree angle with respect to the mid circumferential plane of the tire.However, a treadreinforcement structure made in accordance with the present invention has a first tread reinforcing ply having its reinforcing elements oriented at an angle in the range of about 20 degrees to about 6o degrees with respect to the mid circumferential plane of the tire, folded around the edges of a second tread reinforcing ply having its reinforcing elements oriented at substantially zero degrees with respect to the mid circumferential plane of the tire. A tire having a tread reinforcement structure constructed in accordance with the present invention has an improved resistance vo penetration by a foreign obJect.The resistance of a tire to penetration, in a radial direction, by a foreign object, is referred to herein as the tire 1 plunger energy , which shall mean the amount of energy required for a foreign obJect to penetrate the crown region of a tire in a radial direction. Increased plunger energy can be especially beneficial in radial ply truck tires, which are often subjected to rough road conditions, such as pot holes, and foreign objects lying on roadways, that subject the tread portion of the tire to extreme stresses in a radial direction. As used herein, a radial ply tire shall mean a tire that has the reinforcing elements of its carcass ply oriented at between 80 degrees and 90 degrees with respect to the mid circumferential plane of the tire.As used herein, 11a truck tire is a tire designed to be mounted upon a rim having a nominal bead diameter of 50.8 centimeters 23 inches or larder. There is provided in accordance with one aspect of the present invention a pneumatic tire comprising a carcass having a crown region, a tread portion extending circumferentially about the crown region of the carcass and a tread reinforcement structure disposed circumferentially between the carcass and the tread portion.The tread reinforcement structure is comprised of a first tread reinforcing ply and a second tread reinforcing ply. The first tread reinforcing ply consists of parallel reinforcing elements that form an angle of between about 20 degrees and about 60 degrees relative to the midcircumferential plane of the tire. The first treadreinforcing ply has a central portion and two axial edge portions, each of the axial edge portions being folded radially outwardly and axially inwardly to meet, but not overlap, at the mid circumferential plane of the tire.The second tread reinXorcing ply consists of at least one circum,ferential layer of parallel reinforcing elements that form an angle of between about zero degrees and about 10 degrees relative to the mid circumferential plane of the tire. The second tread reinforcing ply has a width, with respect to the axis of rotation of the tire, that is substantially the same as the width of the central portion of the first tread reinforcing ply.The second tread reinforcing ply is interposed circumferential3y between the central portion and axial edge portions of the first tread reinforcing ply, such that the first tread reinforcing ply restricts the movement of the reinforcing elements of the second treadreinforcing ply in the axial and radial directions, thereby increasing the resistance of the crown region of the carcass to penetration by a foreign object. Brief Description of the Drawings While the specification concludes with claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter regarded as the invention herein, it is believed that the invention will be better understood from the following description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which Fig. 1 represents a radial cross sectional view of a pneumatic tire having a tread reinforcement structure constructed in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention Fig. 2 is a view looking radially inward toward the tread reinforcement structure of the tire shown inFig. 1 Fig. 3 is a partial radial cross sectional view of a pneumatic tire, having a replaceable tread belt, and a tread reinforcement structure constructed in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention and Fig. 4 is a partial radial cross sectional view of a pneumatic tire having a tread reinforcement structure constructed in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention. Description of the Preferred Embodiments In the specification and the claims, the terms axial and flaxiallyll refer to a t ir√ß s axis of rotation. The term axially inward refers to a 0tion going from one sidewall of a tire toward the oppos re sidewall of the same tire, and conversely axially outward refers to a direction going from one sidewall of a tire away from the other sidewall of the same tire. The terms radial and radially refer to planes in which the axis of rotation of a tire lies. The term radially inward refers to a direction going from the tread of a tire toward the axis of rotation of the same tire, while the term radially outward refers to a direction going from the axis of rotation of a tire toward the tread of the same tire.The mid circumferential plane of a tire is a plane perpendicular to the tire s axis of rotation located midway between the sidewalls of the tire at their greatest axial width. Referring now to Figure 1, there is shown a radial cross sectional view of a pneumatic tire 10 having a tread reinforcement structure 12 constructed in accordance with one aspect of the present invention. Pneumatic tire 10 is a radial ply tire, that is to say it has a carcass which is a radial ply carcass. As used herein, a carcass comprises at least one carcass ply 14 of carcass reinforcing elements, such as cords or cables, which are anchored at the radially inward extremities of the tire around substantially inextensible circular beads 16,18 the carcass has a crown region 20 which is defined axially by the tread shoulders 22,24. The sidewalls 26,28 which extend radially inward from the shoulders to the beads are considered herein to be a part of the carcass. The carcass of the tire 10 is a radial ply carcass , which is defined for the purpose of describing and claiming the present invention as a tire carcass in which the reinforcing elements of the carcass ply are oriented at between 80 degrees and 90 degrees with respect to the mid circumferential plane of the tire. A tread portion 30 of elastomeric material, which is not a part of the carcass, extends circumferentially about the crown region of the carcass. A tread reinforcement structure 12 constructed in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention is disposed circumferentially about the crown region 20 of the carcass, and is interposed between the carcass ply 14 and the tread portion 30. The tread reinforcement structure 12 can best be described by referring to both Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, which is a view looking radially inward toward the tread reinforcement structure 12 of the tire 10 shown in Fig. 1. The first tread reinforcing ply 32 is located radially outward of and overlies the crown region of the carcass ply 14.The reinforcing elements of the first tread reinforcing ply may be non metallic cords, or metallic wires or cables, of a material selected in accordance with good engineering practices to have sufficient tensile strength when acting in cooperation with the reinforcing elements of the second tread reinforcing ply 40 to resist penetration of the crown region 20 of the carcass of the tire, especially in a radial direction, by a foreign object. The plunger energy that is required for a particular tire design may be determined by considering the environment in which the tire will be used, or if applicable, by referring to industry and government standards for particular sizes of tires.The reinforcing elements of the first belt ply are embedded in an elastomeric substance such as natural or synthetic rubber, and form an angle of between about 20 degrees and about 60 degrees relative to the mid circumferential plane of the tire, with such an angle sometimes referred to in the tire technologies as a bias angle . For instance, in an 11 75 R 24.5 radial truck tire, it has been found that a bias angle of about 20 degrees for the first belt works quite well when the first ply has reinforcing elements of metallic cables. By metallic cables is meant a plurality of intertwined metallic wires. The first tread reinforcing ply 32 has an axial width which is divided into a central portion 34 and two axial edge portions 36,38.A second tread reinforcing ply 40 has at least one circumferential layer of reinforcing elements embedded in an elastomeric substance forming an angle of between about zero degrees and about ten degrees relative to the mid circumferential plane of the tire, and is disposed radially outward of and adjacent to the central portion 34 of the first tread reinforcing ply 32. The reinforcing cords of the second reinforcing ply may be applied by either continuous wrapping from a spool or calendered fabric. It has been found that in an 11 75 R 24.5 radial truck tire that the reinforcing elements of the second tread reinforcing ply should form an angle of substantially zero degrees, that is, between about zero degrees and about ten degrees, relative to the midcircumferential plane of the tire when the reinforcing elements of the second tread reinforcing ply are metallic cables.Of course, the number of layers in the second tread reinforcing ply is dependent upon the amount of plunger energy that the tire is determined to need, the material selected for the reinforcing elements and the spacing between the reinforcing elements. The axial edge portions 36,38 of the first tread reinforcing ply 32 are then folded radially outwardly and axially inwardly to meet or abut, but not overlap, at or near the midcircumferential plane of the tire, so that the second tread reinforcing ply 40 is interposed circumferentially between the central portion 34 and the axial edge portions 36,38 of the first tread reinforcing ply. In other words, the first tread reinforcing ply completely envelops the second tread reinforcing ply.The second tread reinforcing ply has a width, with respect to the axis of rotation of the tire, that is substantially the same as the width of the central portion of the first tread reinforcing ply. It may be observed from Fig. 2 that a tread reinforcement structure manufactured in accordance with the present invention has a high stacking density . As used herein, stacking density shall mean the number of reinforcing elements that will resist the penetration in a radial direction by a foreign object in a given unit area. A foreign object which attempts to penetrate the treadreinforcement structure shown in Fig. 2 will be resisted by reinforcing elements presenting a lattice of closed geometric figures, at least one half of which are triangular. The exact percentage of the geometric figures in the lattice that are triangles will, of course, be dependent upon the spacing between the reinforcing elements in each tread reinforcing ply. Prior art tread reinforcement structures, in which the reinforcing elements cf the folded tread reinforcing ply were substantially perpendicular to the mid circumferential plane of the tire, presented only square or rectangular geometric figures in the lattice of reinforcing elements which were more easily distorted by a penetrating foreign object that pushed the reinforc ing elements apart However, a tread reinforcement structure constructed in accordance with the present invention has a pattern of reinforcing elements that is not easily distorted, and that may not be penetrated until the foreign object exerts a plunger energy that is substantially equal to the combined tensile strengths of the reinforcing elements in the area that the foreign object is attempting to penetrate. Fig. 3 is a partial radial cross sectional view of a pneumatic tire 100 having a replaceable tread band or belt 142, with the replaceable tread band having an integral tread reinforcement structure 112 constructed in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. Tire 100 shown in Fig. 3 has a carcass, preferably a radial ply carcass, that is similar to that described in regards to tire 10 of Fig. 1. The treadreinforcement structure 112 of tire 100 is substantially the same as that disclosed in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, except that the axial edge portions 136,138 of the first treadreinforcing ply 132 do overlap at the mid circumferential plane of the tire. Of course, the second embodiment of the present invention could be used in an integral tread tire, such as tire 10 shown in Fig. 1, and any embodiment of the invention could be made integral to a replaceable tread band that takes the place of the tread portion of an integral tread tire. Referring next to Fig. 45 there is shown a partial radial cross sectional view of a pneumatLc tire 200 having a tread reinforcement structure 212 constructed in accordance with a third embodiment of the present invention. Tire 200 shown in Fig. 4 has a carcass, preferably a radial ply carcass, that is similar to that described in regards to tire 10 of Fig. 1. The treadreinforcement structure 212 of tire 200 is similar to that disclosed in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, except that this third embodiment of the present invention further comprises a third tread reinforcing ply 244 having parallel reinforcing elements, embedded in an elastomeric material, that form an angle of between about 20 degrees and about 60 degrees relative to the mid circumferential plane of the tire.The reinforcing elements of the third reinforcing ply may, or may not, be the same as those of the first tread reinforcing ply. In this third embodiment, the axial edges of the axial edge portions 236,238 of the first tread reinforcing ply 232 do not meet or abut, but in all other respects the first tread reinforcing ply 232 is the same as the first tread reinforcing ply 32 ofFig. 1 and Fig. 2. The third tread reinforcing ply 244 is disposed circumferentially, radially outward of the second tread reinforcing ply 240, and the third treadreinforcing ply has first and second axial edges that abut or are adjacent to, but not overlapping, the first and second axial edges of the first tread reinforcing ply.The second tread reinforcing ply 240 is substantially the same as the second tread reinforcing ply 40 of Fig. 1 and Fig. 2. While zero degree tread reinforcing belts have been employed in tires in the past to obtain improved highspeed performance characteristics, the function of the zero degree tread reinforcing belts was essentially of an auxiliary nature. However, tires having treadreinforcement structures constructed in accordance with the present invention are designed with sufficient strength in the second tread reinforcing ply, which is a zero degree belt, to handle the static and dynamic forces acting upon the tire with a margin of safety. The second tread reinforcing ply of the present invention is not merely an overlay for one specific application, such as the known use of narrow strips of lightweight nylon at belt edges to act as an auxiliary belt in high speed applications of certain tires. The envelopment of the second tread reinforcing ply by the first tread reinforcing ply, or in the case of the third embodiment by the first and third tread reinforcing plies , is an important structural feature of the present invention. The envelopment stops a chain reaction of the displacement of the reinforcing elements of the second tread reinforcing ply due to the penetration of a foreign object.Without the envelopment containing the displacement, the only resistance to displacement would be the elastomeric material in which the reinforcing elements are embedded, but the envelope makes the compression of the elastomeric material between the reinforcing cords much more difficult, thus increasing the resistance of the reinforcing elements to displacement by a foreign object.
