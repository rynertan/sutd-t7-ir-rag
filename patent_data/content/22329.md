# Electron beam exposure method.

## Abstract
In an electron beam exposure method for directly writing patterns on chips 32 of a semiconductor wafer 10 with an electron beam 13 , each of the chips is sectioned into a plurality of exposure fields F1 F4 , at least one alignment mark 35 is formed in only one exposure field F1 of each chip, alignment of the entire wafer with the electron beam is preliminarily adjusted, alignment of a desired chip 32A with the electron beam is adjusted relying on the alignment mark thereon, the exposure fields of the desired chip are successively exposed to the electron beam so that the entire chip is exposed, and the remaining chips are successively adjusted in alignment and exposed in the same manner as set out above, whereby the entire wafer is exposed.
