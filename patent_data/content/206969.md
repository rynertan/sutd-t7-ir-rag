# Bonded hydrogen conducting solid electrolytes.

## Abstract
Hydronium bonded polycrystalline shaped articles may be produced by the simple expedient of selecting a hydronium containing powder prepared by one of a plurality of prior art methods and then intermingling the hydronium powder with ortho phosphoric acid to obtain a viscous mixture resembling the consistency of toothpaste . The mixture is then formed into a predetermined shape, for example a disc or tube, and the shaped polycrystalline ceramic is allowed to cure. Curing may take place at an elevated temperature below 100 C for approximately 3 hours either as a step subsequent to forming, or as part of the forming step in 30 minutes at 120 C. The result is a bonded hydrogen conducting hydronium, H₃O , solid rigid structure with a smooth finish copying the mold from which it was shaped. Specifically, the hydronium containing powders are selected from the group of poly antimonic acid and precursor powders generally known as Nasicons and preferably being selected from the group of powders consisting of sodium β β alumina, sodium potassium β β alumina, sodium zirpsios, Gasicon and Yasicon.

## Description
This invention relates to the synthesis and fabrication of polycrystalline ceramic materials which conduct electricity by the mobility of hydrogen ions or hydronium ions and that are stable to temperatures above 100 C. As such the invention concerns itself with the preparation of hydronium ion, H₃O , conducting crystalline powder by ion exchanging all or some of the Na ions within a sodium conducting crystalline powder, with H₃O ions and their subsequent fabrication into bonded dense bodies hydronium ion conducting bonded polycrystalline solids . Dense polycrystalline bodies of hydronium are thus capable of use as a membrane in devices such as hydrogen fuel cells, hydrogen detectors, and steam electrolysers. There are a variety of known hydronium conducting compounds, and their crystalline powder form is well known as is their fabrication. We have conceived of a method of bonding such hydronium conducting crystalline powders into dense strong bodies with a hydronium conducting adhesive without affecting the ionic conductivity significantly, thus eliminating laborious steps that are required to preserve the integrity of precursor, ie. Nasicon powders such as various sodium polycrystalline compounds that are generally known as precursor compounds to their hydronium analogue. A commonly known hydronium conductor is hydronium β alumina H₃O β Al₂O₃ . It is a superior conductor of protons, though relatively simple to form, as a powder, from the precursor form Na β β Al₂O₃, it is difficult to fabricate into the preferred polycrystalline rigid form that is the preferred form to be used as the solid electrolyte in fuel cells or in other devices which utilize hydronium β alumina as a proton conducting membrane. Although a sodium ion conducting β alumina can be fabricated into polycrystalline dense bodies by sintering, in spite of its affinity for hydrogen ions, on ion exhange of the Na by protons or hydronium ions the polycrystalline bodies tend to shatter into powder again. This shattering is attributed to the smaller interstitial spaces occupied by the sodium ion, within the molecule of Na β alumina, that is to be replaced by the dimensionally larger hydronium ions. It is known that the dimensional size of the sodium ion Na , is 0.9Å, while the hydronium, H₃O is 1.4Å. In another aspect, the invention relates to other hydronium conducting powders, and their respective bonding into a hydronium conducting polycrystalline solid ceramic electrolyte in a manner as will become apparent. As an object therefore, a crystalline powder form of sodium β alumina is subjected to hydronium ion exchange while still a powder form. The macroscopic shattering problem does not arise because the individual particles are either single crystals or single crystal aggregates in as powder and when the smaller sodium ion is replaced, during ion exchange, by the larger hydronium ion, the lattice structure of each molecule accordingly expands and because those molecules are aggregated in powder form, the powder is able to accommodate the expansion. Even if some shattering takes place the resultant is powder still. We have conceived a method for bonding crystalline powder of hydronium β alumina into dense strong bodies without affecting the ionic conductivity significantly, thus eliminating all the laborious steps that are required in the prior art to produce such product. As another object of the invention the sodium super ionic conductors Na₅ReSi₄O₁₂ where Re Y or Gd or sodium Zirconium phospho silicate These hydronium powders are subject, according to methods of our invention, to bonding whereby to create a solid hydronium conducting electrolyte hence a bonded hydrogen conducting solid electrolyte. According to the present knowledge hydronium conducting β β aluminas in the form of a solid electrolyte may be fabricated as a dense ceramic, for example, by either a direct ion exchange of a sintered sodium β alumina in potassium oxide vapor at 1400 C in an all platinum vessel followed by boiling in concentrated sulphuric acid to form the hydronium analogue, 3 or, b sintering of a mixed sodium potassium β β alumina powder followed by potassium ion exchange in a potassium chloride or nitrate molten salt bath 4, 5 and a following substitution of Na K during final ion exchange by hydronium, to achieve the hydronium form by a field assisted ion exchange FAIE technique in dilute acid at about 90 C 6 . According to these procedures they are multi stage processes that are difficult and time consuming. Often the products tend to crack resulting in a low yield. This cracking is accompanied by low strength which is undesirable for some of the intended applications. Also, in the FAIE stage, only a partial exchange of the sodium and potassium ions by the hydronium ions is achieved otherwise the material develops cracks during extended ion exchange. Another requirement in the process b is to retain a high proportion 60 of β δ phase in the sintered sodium potassium material in order to have high ionic conductivity after hydronium ion exchange. This requires very stringent control of the powder preparation, calcination and sintering stages. As is known in the prior art, the stability of hydronium containing β β alumina materials is poor above about 500 C rendering the formation of cohesive bodies by any form of high temperature sintering process impossible. Known procedures, particularly that developed by Hong, 7 have produced a series of powders based on sodium zirconium phospho silicate Max Planck Institute 8 has developed a modified version of Nazirpsio according to the following formula Na Accordingly, for the purposes of this disclosure, Nazirpsios shall be either of the aforesaid analogue or their respective mixtures. The Nazirpsios therefore may be represented by the general formula Further, the aforesaid inventive method of bonding has application to other Hydrogen conducting forms of Nasicons Yasicon sodium yttrium silicate or Gasicon sodium gadolinium silicate . In one aspect, we have developed a process for the direct production of a hydroniumβ alumina powder virtually free of the related hydroniumβ alumina form. The hydroniumβ alumina powder may be bonded into dense strong bodies which retain their affinity for protons to temperatures in excess of 100 C. This process has advantage as it avoids the need to produce an intermediate sodium potassium sintered precursor material having an f β 0.4 5 as is required by the prior art 5,6,9 . The achievement of an f β 0.4 5,6,9 in a dense sintered precursor material containing both sodium and potassium is very difficult time consuming involving many laborious steps . This invention contemplates the use of precursor powders having mixtures of X β β alumina produced by the known spray drying or freeze drying processes 4,5,6 or any other processes 1,2, 3, 10 , then calcining them to X β β alumina mixtures having a concentration of β between 1 and 99 by weight . It further contemplates the treatment of the calcined powder with an acidic solution to create a hydronium containing β β alumina solid, powder or compound H₃0 ,X β β Al₂0₃ where X is a cation, preferably and may be Na where there is no complete ion exchange We,however,can easily achieve complete ion exchange of Na as will become apparent. This invention contemplates a quicker and simpler method for the formation of dense, cohesive bodies than is revealed in the prior art. It also contemplates the fabrication of hydronium conductive bodies of diverse shapes while avoiding any high temperature sintering stages required by the prior art. It further contemplates the use of other hydronium containing solids in powder form. The invention contemplates the use of a hydronium conducting bonding agent selected from the group of bonding agents comprising hydronium conducting organic polymers and phosphates. It further envisages the use of aluminium hydrogen phosphates as a conductive bonding agent for hydronium containing powders. It also envisages the use of zirconium hydrogen phosphates as a conductive bonding agent for hydronium containing powders thereby binding them into solid polycrystalline bodies. The invention further envisages the use of phosphorus containing compounds known to be insoluble in water for the bonding of hydronium ion conducting powders, whether aluminas or phospho silicates, into solid polycrystalline electrolyte ceramics. The invention therefore achieves a method of chemically bonding hydronium ion conducting solid electrolyte powder into dense polycrystalline shaped bodies comprising the steps of More particularly, the invention therefore achieves a method of chemically bonding hydronium ion conducting solid electrolyte powder into dense polycrystalline shaped bodies comprising the steps of The invention also contemplates that the hydronium containing powder selected in step a as aforesaid, is selected from the group of materials comprising X β β Al₂O₃ J Zr The invention also contemplates a hydronium ion conducting bonded polycrystalline solid, snow white in colour, very difficult to break by hand and with good resistance to breaking, shattering and cracking and having a conductivity at 100 C between 1.4 x 10 ⁴ ohm cm ¹ and 6.0 x 10 ⁴ olm cm ¹ wherein 50 to 90 by weight is the hydronium conducting phase, the balance an ionic bonding agent. Specifically, the ionic bonding agent is an ion conducting polymer, or a hydrogen phosphate, while the hydronium conducting phase is H₃O β β A1₂O₃ or hydronium Zirpsio or hydronium Gasicon or hydronium Yasicon or poly antimonic acid. The invention will now be described by way of examples, there being no drawings. A precursor powder for sodium β β alumina is prepared by spray drying a slurry containing finely divided alpha alumina in a solution of bicarbonates of sodium and magnesium in required proportions according to known procedures 11 . The powder is then calcined at 1300 1700 C to obtain a sodium β β alumina powder containing 80 90 of β alumina. 20 g of this powder is refluxed with 1.5 L of 0.1N hot approximately 100 C hydrochloric acid diluted slightly in water, in a 2L round bottom flask for 4 6 hours. Exchange of the sodium ions by hydronium ions takes place during this process. The contents are allowed to cool to room temperature and then transferred into a 2 L beaker and the residue is allowed to settle then filtered by decantation. The residue is washed in distilled water and dried in an air oven at about 90 C to yield the hydronium β β alumina powder. An X ray diffraction pattern showed that the product was about 90 β alumina, balance β alumina. A small fraction of the product after heat treatment at 800 C showed no X ray pattern for β or β alumina, but only broad peaks corresponding to gamma type alumina. This proves that the product after exchange in hot acid was hydronium β β alumina H₃O β β A1₂O₃. If the product had been sodium β β alumina, the β phase would not have decomposed at 800 C . In one procedure, 1.5 g of the hydronium β β alumina powder produced as aforesaid was ground with 0.6 g of orthophosphoric acid in an alumina mortar and the resulting mixture was white and slightly more viscous than toothpaste. The mixture was pressed in a 2.5 cm diameter steel die with Teflon lining and Teflon caps at a pressure of about 14 KPa. The pellet was removed from the die and held in an air oven at about 80 C for 3 hours. It formed a hard disc of density 2.8g mL as measured from the physical dimensions. In another procedure, the hydronium β alumina phosphoric acid mixture, prepared as above, was pressed into a Teflon lined die and heated under pressure at about 14KPa and 120 C for 30 min. A hard disc of density 3.08g mL was obtained. The disc had a smooth surface mirroring that of the die, was snow white in colour, very difficult to break by hand and when dropped onto a wooden floor from the height of about 1 1 2 metres, the disc did not break, shatter, nor crack, nor was it otherwise visibly damaged. These physical properties were achieved by either of the aforesaid 2 procedures. A sodium zirpsio Na A 1.5g sample of the hydronium zirpsio powder is mixed with 0.6g of ortho phosphoric acid diluted slightly in water and is pressed in a Teflon lined steel die approximately 2.5 cm in diameter at about 14 KPa at 120 C for 30 min. A dense hard disc of bonded hydronium zirpsio is obtained. The physical properties of the disc were similar to that of Example 1. Instead of sodium β β alumina or Nazirpsio in example 1 and 2 respectively, a sample of Gasicon, Na₅GdSi₄O₁₂, is prepared by known methods 10 and is then used for refluxing with a hot hydrochloric acid. The resultant hydronium formed is dried as aforesaid then, bonded as in Examples 1 and 2, with the said phosphoric acid. The resultant dense hard disc had the same physical properties as in the earlier examples. Similarly, in a like procedure as in Example 2, a sample of Yasicon Na₅YSi₄O₁₂, prepared by the known methods 10 is then used for refluxing with a hot hydrochloric acid. The resultant hydronium formed is dried as aforesaid then bonded as in Examples 1 and 2, with the said phosphoric acid. The resultant dense hard disc had the same physical properties as in the earlier examples. Poly antimonic acid, a hydronium conductor in powder form, was mixed with ortho phosphoric acid and processed as aforesaid, then pressed in a Teflon lined steel die of approximately 2.5 cm in diameter and at about 14 KPa at 100 C for 30 minutes. Once again the same snow white hard disc now of bonded poly antimonic acid was obtained. Typical conductivity results of some of the products obtained according to the examples are given for various temperatures as per the following table H₃O β β alumina bonded hard disc fabricated as per Example 1 according to either of the curing procedures In each of the aforesaid compositions there is a phosphate which is formed as a result of curing and acts as the hydronium conducting ionic binding agent with the individual crystals of the powder whose precursor was the Nasicon. Thus in Example 1, the dense hard disc has a chemical composition where 50 to 85 by weight is H₃O β β Al₂O₃ and the balance alumina hydrogen phosphate. In Example 2 between 50 and 90 of the dense hard disc is hydronium zirpsio and the balance zirconium hydrogen phosphate. Similarly, the hard disc of Examples 3 and 4 are 50 to 90 , respectively, hydronium Gasicon and hydronium Yasicon respectively, the balance Gadolinium and Yttrium acid phoshate and for Example 5, 50 to 90 is poly antimonic acid the balance by weight antimonic hydrogen phosphate.
