# Cyclic polycarbonate oligomers and methods for their preparation and use.

## Abstract
Cyclic polycarbonate thiol analog oligomer mixtures are prepared by the reaction of bishaloformates or their thio analogs or mixtures thereof with dihydroxy or dimercapto compounds, with alkali metal hydroxides and various amines. The oligomer mixtures may be converted to poly carbonates or their thiol analogs by a method which is par ticularly adaptable to integration with polycarbonate processing operations.
