# Gradation correction curve creating method and apparatus.

## Abstract
In a radiation image system wherein a stimulable phos phor 1 carrying a radiation image stored therein is ex posed to stimulating rays which cause it to emit light in proportion to the radiation energy stored, and the emitted light is detected 4 and converted to an electric signal which is processed to reproduce a visible image 14 , several reference gradation correction curves are created on an orthogonal system of signal level optical density coor dinates 9 . One of the reference curves is selected and rotated around a point on the reference curve on the coor dinate system, and or parallel shifted on the coordinate system to obtain a desired gradation correction curve.
