# A method and apparatus for controlling an infinitely variable transmission.

## Abstract
An infinitely variable V belt transmission 1,14,7 is con trolled in such a way that the input speed is determined as a function of the power to be transmitted and of the transmis sion ratio. The pressure of the fluid 12 within the secondary pulley 8,9 is used as a control signal representative of the transmis sion ratio.
