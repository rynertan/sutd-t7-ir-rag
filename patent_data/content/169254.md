## Description
PROCESS FOR PURIFICATION OF 1,2UNSATURATED CARBOXYLIC ACIDS AND OR ESTERS THEREOF BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONField of the Invention This invention relates to a process for purifying a 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acid and or its esters. In accordance with the process of the present invention, aldehydes contained as impurities in 1,2unsaturated carboxylic acids and or their esters can be removed efficiently by simple operations.Prior Art 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acids such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, etc. and or their esters have a broad range of uses as starting materials for synthesis of high molecular compounds. These 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acids have been produced industrially through a vapor phase catalytic oxidation reaction of alkenes and or alkenals, etc., in recent years However, the 1,2 unsaturated ca rboxylic acids such as acrylic acid and methacrylic acia proouced according to the above method contain various types of impurities such as aldehydes, e.g., formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, isobutylaldehyde, acrolein, methacrolein, furfural, and benzaldehyde ketones, e.g., acetone or acids, e.g., formic acid, acetic acid, and propionic acid. A considerable amount of these impurities are separated and removed by repeating conventional purification methods such as distillation, extraction and the like. However, aldehyde impurities remain in the 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acids, because i aldehydes are newly formed during the above mentioned purification operations such as distillation and extraction for example, acrolein contained in acrylic acid is thermally converted to acrolein dimer during the purification process of the acrylic acid and ii aldehydes such as furfural and benzaldehyde have boiling points close to that of acrylic acid and separation thereof from the acrylic acid by distillation operation is difficult. On the other hand, in the industrial production of 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acid esters, these esters are usually obtained by esterification of the corresponding 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acids which have been produced at a low cost according to the above mentioned industrial method and purification by simple distillation. Thus, the resulting 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acid esters are inevitably contaminated with aldehyde impurities as mentioned above. When such 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acids and or their esters containing the aldehyde impurities are used as starting materials for synthesis of high molecular compounds, these impurities cause various problems such as a polymerization inhibition effect and coloring of the resulting polymers. Examples of methods for removing aldehyde impurities contained in 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acids and or their esters are a distillation method an adsorption method using activated carbon or molecular sieves having an amine compound adsorbed thereon Japanese Laid Open Patent Specification No.18934 81 and a method of forming sulfite addition products by the addition reaction of sodium bisulfite a method comprising addition of an amine compound JapanesePatent Publication No.31087 73 or addition of an amino acid such as glycine Japanese Patent Publication No.14 80 have been known. However, in the distillation method, acrolein exhibits complicated behavior during purification.For example, during purification of acrylic acid, for example, the acrolein is readily dimerized into acrolein dimer during distillation process as mentioned above or reacts with water to form ss hydroxyl propionaldehyde. On the other hand, large numbers of distillation plates and a large reflux ratio are required for the sufficient separation of aldehydes such as furfural and benzaldehyde because the difference in boiling point between these aldehydes and acrylic acid are small and because these aldehydes have small relative volatility against acrylic acid. It is disadvantageous from the industrial point of view to conduct rectification of polymerizable acrylic acid at a high temperature and under such severe conditions because special means and the like are required for preventing polymerization of the acid. On the other hand, the adsorption method by means of activated carbon or the above mentioned molecular sieves requires a troublesome regeneration operation of the adsorbent used and, moreover, is unsatisfactory for the removal of trace amounts of impurities. The method comprising formation of sulfide addition products by addition reaction of sodium bisulfite has almost no effectiveness in the case of purification of, for example, a 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acid. The method comprising addition of an amine compound or an amino acid fails to satisfactorily remove aldehyde impurities. Moreover, it is generally known that amine compounds have a polymerization promoting effect on 1,2unsaturated carboxylic acids and theiresters. Also, some amines such as anhydrous hydrazine are unstable and dangerous, which gives rise to problems of process operation and safety. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a process for removing aldehydes contained in a 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acid and or its ester almost completely by very simple treatment operations, whereby the above described problems are solved. In accordance with the present invention, there can be obtained efficiently, economically and in a high yield, a 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acid or its ester of extremely high purity which does not cause problems with respect to the aldehyde impurities when it is used as a starting material for synthesis of high molecular compounds. More specifically, the present invention provides a process for purifying a 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acid and or its ester containing aldehyde impurities, which comprises treating the 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acid and or its ester with a compound containing at least one mercapto group in the molecule in the presence of an acid catalyst. It will be apparent from the examples which will be shown hereinbelow that, according to the present process, a compound containing at least one mercapto group in its molecule reacts with aldehyde impurities very selectively under moderate conditions in the presence of an acid catalyst, while giving rise to almost no reactions, such as Michael addition reaction, with 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acids and or their esters which possess highly active double bonds and carbonyl groups and exist in large amounts. From the reaction products, there can be obtained readily and efficiently 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acids and or their esters of very high purity. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 1,2 unsaturated compounds The 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acids containing aldehydes as impurities to be purified according to the process of the present invention are 1,2unsaturated carboxylic acids having 3 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably 3 or 4 carbon atoms, such as, for example, acrylic acid and methacrylic acid. In general, the 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acids are obtained by subjecting the corresponding alkenes and or alkenals, etc. to a vapor phase catalytic oxidation as disclosed in, for example, Japanese LaidOpen Patent Nos.102536 80, 113730 80, 73014 81 and 45130 82 Specifications , followed by conventional purification processes, i.e., distillation, extraction or the like, to remove a major part of the by products. The 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acids thus obtained by such a conventional purification process contain considerably less than about 2 wt.E, normally less than about 1 wt. , of aldehyde impurities. As the 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acid esters containing aldehyde impurities, those which have been produced by the esterification reaction of the abovementioned 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acids according to a conventional method can be used. Specific examples of the 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acid esters include methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, ethyl methacrylate, butyl acrylate, butyl methacrylate, isobutyl acrylate, isobutyl methacrylate, hexyl acrylate, hexyl methacrylate, octyl acrylate, octyl methacrylate, lauryl acrylate, lauryl methacrylate, glycidyl acrylate, glycidyl methacrylate, methyl cellosolve acrylate, methyl cellosolve methacrylate, ethyl cellosolve acrylate, ethyl cellosolve methacrylate, 2 hydroxylethyl acrylate, 2 hydroxylethyl methacrylate, 2 hydroxylpropyl acrylate, 2 hydroxylpropyl methacrylate,N,N dimethylaminoethyl acrylate, N,N dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, methyl carbitol acrylate, and methyl carbitol methacrylate. In the case where the aldehyde impurities contained in the above mentioned esters are to be removed, the process according to the present invention can be applied before or after the esterification reaction of the corresponding 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acids. Moreover, the process can also be applied during the esterification reaction.Mercapto compounds Any compound containing at least one mercapto group in its molecule can be used in the present method as long as it dissolves in the 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acid or its ester. Specific examples of such compounds include alkyl mercaptans such as methyl mercaptan, ethyl mercaptan, n propyl mercaptan, n butyl mercaptan, n hexyl mercaptan, 2 ethyl n hexyl mercaptan, noctyl mercaptan, n dodecyl mercaptan, and n cetyl triercaptan, stearyl mercaptan, particularly those having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, preferably 8 to 18 carbon atoms cycloalkyl mercaptans such as cyclohexyl mercaptan, alkenyl or cycloalkenyl mercaptans such as allyl mercaptan and 4 mercaptocyclopentene alkoxyl or aryloxy alkyl or cycloalkyl mercaptans such as methoxymethyl mercaptan, ethoxyethyl mercaptan, 3 ethoxyl n propyl mercaptan, 4 ethoxy n butyl mercaptan, 3 ethoxy 2 ethyl nhexyl mercaptan, 2 methoxycyclohexyl mercaptan, phenoxymethyl mercaptan, 2 phenoxyethyl mercaptan, 3 phenoxy n propyl inercaptan, and 2 phenoxycyclohexyl mercaptan aralkyl group containing mercaptans such as benzyl mercaptan, 2 phenylethyl mercaptan, 3 phenyl n propyl mercaptan, 2 phenyln butyl mercaptan, and 2 phenyl n hexyl mercaptan aryl mercaptans such as phenyl mercaptan, tolyl mercaptan and naphthyl mercaptan halogenated aryl mercaptans such as p chlorophenyl mercaptan, p bromophenyl mercaptan, p fluorophenyl mercaptan, p iodophenyl mercaptan, 2 chloronaphthyl mercaptan, and 2bromonaphthyl mercaptan alkoxy or aryloxy aryl mercaptans such as p methoxyphenyl mercaptan, p ehovxyphenyl mercaptan, p propoxyphenyl mercaptan, and p phenoxyphenyl mercaptan alkaryl group containing mercaptans such as o methylphenyl mercaptan, p methylphenyl mercaptan, p ethylphenyl mercaptan, p n propylphenyl mercaptan, o n propylphenyl mercaptan, o n butylphenyl mercaptan, p n dodecylphenyl mercaptan and p 2 ethoxy nhexyl phenyl nercaptan dimercaptans such as dithioethane, 1,2 propanedithiol, 1,3 propanedithiol, 1,4butanedithiol, diethyleneglycol dimercaptan, and triethyleneglycol dimercaptan, particularly those having 1 to 18 carbon atoms, preferably 8 to 18 carbon atoms mercaptoalcohols and halogen substituted mercaptoalcohols such as 2 mercaptoethanol, l mercapto 2 propanol, l thioglycerol, and 1 chloro 3 mercapto 2 propanol thiocarboxylic acids such as thioacetic acid and thiobenzoic acid mercapto substituted carboxylic acids and their ester derivatives such as thioglycolic acid, mercaptopropionic acid, thiosalicyclic acid, ethyl thioglycolate, and 2 ethylhexyl thioglycolate as well as furfuryl mercaptan, 2 mercaptobenzothiazole, and 2 mercaptobenzoimidazole. Such compounds containing at least one mercapto group can be used alone or as a mixture thereof. The mercapto group containing compounds especially preferred for use in the present invention are alkyl mercaptans and dimercaptans such as those exemplified above since they are highly efficacious, and alkyl mercaptans are most preferable because of their availability. More particularly, alkyl mercaptans having a boiling point not lower than that of n dodecyl mercaptan, viz. ca. 2700C, are preferable for stabilization of acrylic acid. The amount of the mercapto group containing compound to be added depends on the concentration of the aldehyde impurities contained in the crude 1,2unsaturated carboxylic acid and or its ester as well as on the desired extent of the removal thereof, and is generally from equimole to 10 fold mole, preferably 3 to 5 fold mole, of the total molar amount of the aldehyde impurities. The unreacted mercapto compound used and the reaction products produced by the reaction with the mercapto compound and the aldehyde impurities cain, if desired, be readily separated by distillation in the presence of a conventional polymerization inhibitor such as hydroquinone or hydroquinone monomethyl ether after the reaction treatment. Therefore, the mercapto compound used in the present invention should be selected from the compounds having a large difference in boiling point from and advantageously having a boiling point higher than that of the 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acid or its ester to be stabilized.Acid catalyst Any acid catalyst can be used in the present invention provided that it can donate ordinary protons.Examples of such acid catalysts include 1 proton acids such as mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and phosphoric acid organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, and malonic acid p toluenesulfonic acid sulfonated cation exchange resins such as sulfonic acid groupintroduced resins of styrene divinylbenzene copolymers, crosslinked polystyrene, and phenol formaldehyde resin and 2 Lewis acids such as zinc chloride and aluminum chloride. The 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acids themselves may be used as such an acid catalyst. However, the 1,2unsaturated carboxylic acids are not preferred as the catalyst from an economical viewpoint in the industrial production since they are generally weak acids, and thus the reaction rate is decreased. It is preferable to use as the acid catalyst strong acids such as the above mentioned mineral acids, p toluenesulfonic acid, and the sulfonated cation exchange resins. Of these strong acids, the sulfonated cation exchange resins are particularly preferred for the reasons that these resins not only provide the required acidity bu. also have low corrosive action on the apparatus used.Further, such solid acids as cation exchange resins are preferable because they can be used in the form of a fixed bed through which a 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acids and or esters thereof are passed.Stabilization The process according to the present invention comprises treatment of a 1,2 unsaturated carboxylic acid and or an ester thereof containing aldehyde impurities with a compound containing at least one mercapto group in the molecule in the presence of an acid catalyst. Such treatment can be carried out either in a batchwise system or in a continuous system.In one of the preferred embodiments of the process according to the invention, a particulate solid catalyst such as the sulfonated cation exchange resins is used as the catalyst and the reaction is carried out by causing the reactants to flow through a fixed bed of the particulate catalyst. The reaction temperature is in the range of 200 to l200C, preferably 250 to 900C. The reaction pressure is not especially restricted, a pressure sufficient for maintaining the liquid phase being satisfactory.It is advantageous, however, to employ a pressure in the range of 1 to 50 atm, preferably 1 to 5 atm. The reaction time depends upon the reaction conditions such as the type of the catalyst used, reaction temperature, and the reaction system but is ordinarily in the range of 0.1 to 24 hours, preferably 0.1 to 3 hours.

Then, a mixture of the crude methacrylic acid as used in Examples 20 through 22 and n dodecyl mercaptan added to the methacrylic acid in a 10 fold molar amount of the total molar amount of the furfural and benzaldehyde contained in the crude methacrylic acid was passed through the glass tube and subjected to continuous reaction at 500C with a residence time of 30 minutes. After the reaction, the treated liquid was analyzed by gas chromatography whereupon only a trace amount each of furfural and benzaldehyde were found.Example 45 To 100 g of the crude acrylic acid as used inExamples 1 through 19 were added 105 of n butanol., 100 g of benzene, 3 g of p toluenesulfonic acid PTSA , n dodecyl mercaptan in an amount of 10 times the total molar amount of the furfural and benzaldehyde contained in the crude acrylic acid, and 0.2 g of hydroquinone.The resulting mixture was placed in a 500 ml threenecked flask and subjected to esterification at 900C for about 5 hours while dehydration was conducted. After the reaction, unreacted acid and ptoluenesulfonic acid were neutralized. The resulting aqueous layer was separated, and then 0.2 g of additional hydroquinone was added to the reaction system.Then, benzene and unreacted n butanol were distilled away under reduced pressure to obtain 82 g of n butyl acrylate. The n butyl acrylate was analyzed by gas chromatography whereupon only a trace amount each of furfural and benzaldehyde were found.Comparative Example 1 The esterification reaction shown in Example 45 was repeated except that no n dodecyl mercaptan was added to produce 85 g of n butyl acrylate.
