# TOILET SEAT COVER

## Abstract
A novel toilet seat cover is provided herein. The cover 10 comprises a water impermeable, non porous, very light weight, easily disposable paper, preferably waxed, provided with a central longitudinal opening in the form of a slit 112 or a perforation or a line of weakness 12 . The toilet seat cover is folded longitudinally along the slit or perforation and then is folded transversely in a zig zag or back and forth accordion type fold 12 at last for the region of the slit or perforation. The toilet seat cover, when in use, is adapted to be placed over the toilet seat and to have its peripheral edges folded under the toilet seat to be retained thereby, and further, by the sole application of body pressure by the user is thus adapted to be made to fit a toilet seat opening automatically. The toilet seat cover may be dispersed in the form of individual folded seat covers or in the form of a seat cover detached from a roll 19 of a plurality of identical seat covers. Thus. with the present invention, the entire toilet seat cover is placed on the toilet seat, and the peripheral edges then folded under the toilet seat so that the cover may be retained thereby. Then, by the user sitting on the toilet seat cover, the slit 112 or perforation 12 automatically extends and expands to provide the optimum opening.
