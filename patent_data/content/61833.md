# Process for producing stable dispersions in water dilutable liquid media of halogen containing addition polymer, employing a polymeric dispersant, and waterborne coating compositions based on dispersions so made.

## Abstract
Stable dispersions of halogen containing addition po lymers, such as polyvinylidene fluoride, in water dilutable liquid media, for exampe 2 butoxyethanol, are produced by dispersing pre formed particles of the polymer, of a number average size in the range 0.1 10 microns, in the liquid medium in the presence of a polymeric dispersant contain ing in the molecule a hydrophobic polymer chain and strongly ionised groups, in particular quaternary ammonium groups, the strongly ionised groups being present in such a proportion as to provide a charge density of from 0.05 to 6.0 milliequivalents per gram of the total dispersant. The dispersions thus obtained are valuable as a basis for water borne coating compositions.
