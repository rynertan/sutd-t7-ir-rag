# Friction material for brake linings and the like.

## Abstract
A friction material for brake linings is formed using a polystilbazole resin 3 16 by weight to provide the matrix for the material. The balance of the material is filler material such as steel wool, metal powders, carbon, ceramic pow ders, and friction modifiers. The lining is produced by mixing the ingredients and hot pressing the mixture at temperatures which promote the flow and cure of the resin, and at pressures which produce a material of suitable density.
