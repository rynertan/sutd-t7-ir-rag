# Novel adhesive compositions and bonding method employing the same.

## Abstract
An adhesive composition comprising an adhesive base and accelerator portion, the adhesive base comprising a a polymerizable monomer selected from the group consisting of unsubstituted alpha cyanoacrylates and substituted alpha cyanoacrylates and b an effective amount of stabilizer and the accelerator portion comprising a weakly acidic or weakly basic ionic accelerator compound com prising a cation M and an anion A, the pKa relating to cation M in the equilibrium defined by M Hâ‚‚O MOH H being at least about 10, the pKa relating to anion A in the equilibrium defined by HA A H being less than or equal to about 0, and the nucleophilicity constant of anion A being less than about 2 when cation M is an onium cation comprising more than 8 carbons, the nucleophilicity constant being determined relative to methyl iodide the adhesive composition being further charac terized in that it exhibits a set time of less than 1 3 that of the adhesive base alone and provides a bond which exhibits overlap shear value of at least about 28.12 kg sq. cm. In contrast to many compositions which include strongly basic or alkaline ionic accelerators, these adhesive compositions exhibit suitable cure rates when employed on wooden sub strates and result in strong bonds which age well in the presence of heat and moisture. Methods of bonding wooden substrates using weakly acidic or weakly basic ionic accelerator compounds are also described herein.
