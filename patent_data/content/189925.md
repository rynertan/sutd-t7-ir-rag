# SELF TIMED IMMUNOASSAY DEVICE

## Abstract
A process for determining the presence of a particular immunological component A in a test sample, comprising immobilizing at one end of a wick a specimen of said immunological component A or of an immunological com ponent specific to A, passing through said wick said sample and a first reagent comprising an enzyme conjugated to an immunological component B which is either specific to said immunological component A, or immunologically compara ble to A, whereby the enzyme carrying reagent attaches to antigen sites if such sites have not previously been filled by immunological component A in the sample, then passing through the wick by capillarity a second reagent containing a substrate acted upon by the enzyme of the first reagent, and determining the extent of enzymatic reaction on the subs trate, the extent of enzymatic reaction indicating the amount of the immunological component in the initial sample. Various alternative processes are provided, including using an immunological reagent with a fluorescent or like label which may compete with the test sample, the wick being assayed for the presence or absence of such label this eliminates the need for an enzyme and substrate. Kits are also provided.
