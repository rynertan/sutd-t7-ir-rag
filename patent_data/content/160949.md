# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CONTROLLING AIR FUEL RATIO IN SEQUENTIAL INJECTION TYPE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE

## Abstract
In a sequential injection type internal combustion en gine, a fuel amount is calculated for each cylinder and a fuel increment is calculated in accordance with a predetermined parameter of the engine. A fuel supply start timing and a fuel supply end timing for each cylinder are calculated in accordance with the fuel amount for the corresponding cylinder and the fuel increment currently calculated.
