# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ULTRASONIC TESTING OF TUBULAR GOODS

## Abstract
The present invention relates to an improved method and apparatus for ultrasonic testing of tubular goods. With the object in mind to provide an ultrasonic test apparatus and method for testing tubular goods that effect plural modes of examination simultaneously and without need for rotation of the tubular goods, a circular array of ultrasonic transducers is provided which examine for each of transverse and longitudi nal defects while additional transducers within the same array verify wall thickness of the tubular specimen. Slidable seal enclosure means maintains fluid energy couplant in envelopment of the circular array while allowing axial move ment of the test specimen relative thereto. The array and enclosure may be constructed with attached motive means for carrying the array along the horizontal tubular goods while testing, or the array and enclosure may be associated with stationary support structure including motive means for driv ing the tubular goods axially through the array while testing.
