# Method of forming a brake drum.

## Abstract
A method of forming a brake drum includes the steps of casting an iron cylindrical braking drum 10 with a flange end 18 and an opened end 16 to include a plurality of generally axially extending fins 26 around an exterior surface thereof. The casting includes providing the fins 26 with radially extending side walls 28, 30 which diverge along a length thereof from the opened end 16 to a widest distance therebetween at a predetermined location from the opened end and converge along the length thereof from the predetermined location to the flange end. Accordingly, adjacent side walls 28, 30 of adjacent fins 26 define a space 34 therebetween having its narrowest portion 36 at the predetermined location 32 . A braking surface 24 is a machined about an interior of the cylindrical braking drum. A top of the fins is machined at either side of the predeter mined location 32 to include a shoulder at the end thereof away from the opened end. A steel band 38 is formed and secured to the braking drum 10 at the top of the fins to encircle the braking drum 10 at the predetermined location 32 .
