## Description
GAS LIQUID PROCESS FOR PREPARING ISOBUTYRYL FLUORIDE AND REACTOR THEREFOR. The invention pertains to a process for preparing isobutyryl fluoride from carbon monoxide, propylene and hydrogen fluoride. U.S.Patent No. 2,831,877 describes a batch process for making carboxylic acids from olefins, carbon monoxide, an acidic medium such as hydrogen fluoride and water. However, the process is uneconomical because high polymeric acids and other compounds form, causing poor yields of carboxylic acids. U.S.Patent No. 3,059,007 describes an improved process in which the mono olefinic charge is hydrogenated prior to reaction to remove any polyolefinic materials which cause polymerization, but the resulting yields of mono carboxylic acids are only 53.6 to 62 percent. European Patent Application No.0,017,441 describes reacting a boron trifluoride catalyst and an alcohol in equal molar quantities, followed by separating the ester formed and the catalyst. This process cannot be used to form the isobutyryl fluoride.European Patent No.0,031,886 describes a process for making isobutyric acid or its lower alkyl esters, but such a process cannot be used to make isobutyryl fluoride. However, none of the above mentioned prior art teach or suggest how to reduce the expensive costs of recovering and recycling carbon monoxide. The present invention overcomes the expensive recovery and recycling of carbon monoxide of the prior art for a complex co current gasliquid reaction. The invention provides a continuous co current pressurized gasliquid process and the apparatus therefor for producing isobutyryl fluoride from carbon monoxide, hydrogen fluoride and propylene. The process comprises Step a , a first fluid mixture comprised of carbon monoxide and propylene is co currently reacted under pressure in a reactor with a first liquid comprised of hydrogen fluoride at conditions whereby isobutyryl fluoride forms Step b the product mixture from Step a is separated at a pressure substantially equal to the reaction pressure into a second gas mixture comprised of carbon monoxide and a second liquid comprised of isobutyryl fluoride, hydrogen fluoride and carbon monoxide Step c , the second liquid from Step b is separated at a pressure substantially below the reaction pressure into a third liquid comprised of isobutyryl fluoride, and hydrogen fluoride Step d , the second and third gas mixtures from Steps b and c together with make up carbon monoxide and propylene, are formed into the first fluid mixture Step e , the first fluid mixture from Step d is recycled to react as in Step a so that isobutyryl fluoride is continuously formed. In another embodiment, the hydrogen fluoride is separated and recycled. The drawing shows a schematic representation of the process and reactor. The invention concerns a continuous gas liquid pressurized process for producing isobutyryl fluoride from carbon monoxide, propylene and hydrogen fluoride whereby the carbon monoxide or both carbon monoxide and hydrogen fluoride are inexpensively recycled so that waste carbon monoxide or waste hydrogen fluoride and carbon monoxide is kept to a minimum. The process is based on the following steps Step a co currently reacting under pressure in a co current reactor a first fluid mixture comprised of carbon monoxide and propylene with a first liquid comprised of hydrogen fluoride under conditions whereby isobutyryl fluoride forms Step b separating at a pressure substantially equal to the reaction pressure the product mixture formed in Step a into a second gas mixture comprised of carbon monoxide, and into a second liquid comprised of isobutyryl fluoride, hydrogen fluoride, and carbon monoxide Step c separating at a pressure substantially below the reaction pressure, the second liquid from Step b into a third gas mixture comprised of carbon monoxide and a third liquid comprised of isobutyryl fluoride and hydrogen fluoride Step d forming the first fluid mixture from the second and third gas mixtures of Steps b and c together with make up carbon monoxide and propylene Step e recycling the first fluid mixture from Step d to the reactor for reaction as in Step a whereby isobutyryl fluoride forms in a continuous process. The first liquid is comprised of hydrogen fluoride, preferably of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, and may include a small amount of isobutyryl fluoride, carbon monoxide, and other inerts such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen and alkanes which do no effect the reaction. The first fluid mixture is comprised of carbon monoxide and propylene, preferably as a gas, but can also include other inerts such as alkanes like propane and or carbon dioxide and or nitrogen. In another embodiment of the reaction, the hydrogen fluoride is separated from the third liquid formed from the second gas liquid separation of Step c . The separation can easily be done by simple distillation. The separated hydrogen fluoride is also recycled to react as in Step a . The apparatus also called the reactor 10 for conducting a continuous co current gas liquid process under pressure to form isobutyryl fluoride from a liquid comprised of hydrogen fluoride and a fluid mixture comprised of carbon monoxide and propylene is schematically shown in the attached drawing. The apparatus comprises at least one reactor tube 20 having a back end 30 and a front end 25 . The front end 25 has connected to it a means 35 for injecting a fluid mixture, such as propylene and carbon monoxide into a liquid, so that the gas liquid reaction mixture enters the reactor tube 20 for reaction. The means 35 for injection of a fluid mixture can be an aspirator nozzle, a jet nozzle, or other suitable devices known in the art. A means 40 for introducing liquid comprised of hydrogen fluoride under pressure connects to the front end 25 of the reactor tube 20 . One such means comprises a liquid pump as shown in the drawing connected by a line to the front end 25 of the reactor tube 20 . Other suitable devices known in the art may also be used. A first gas liquid separator 45 which has means for refrigeration with a liquid section 51 and a gas section 50 connects to the back end 30 of the reactor tube 20 . A means 42 for introducing propylene as a fluid form of a liquid or gas, or both, but preferably as a gas, into the reactor 10 is connected to the means 35 for injecting a fluid mixture into the liquid stream. The means 42 for introducing propylene as shown comprises a constant flowliquid pump and line which connects to the fluid injecting means 35 . Other suitable devices known in the art may also be used for introducing propylene into the reactor. A second gas liquid separator 55 which has a gas section 56 and a liquid section 57 connects to at least one reducing valve 58 . The reducing valve 58 connects to the liquid section 51 of the first gasliquid separator 45 and to the gas section 56 of the second gas liquid separator 55 . A first compressor pump 60 , preferably a staged compressor pump, is used to compress the gas mixture comprised mainly of carbon monoxide coming from the gas section 56 of the second gas liquid separator through second line 65 . The first compressor pump 60 is connected to a carbon monoxide source 62 , for example a carbon monoxide source from a refinery. The first compressor pump 60 compresses the carbon monoxide from source 62 and the gas mixture from the second gas liquid separator 55 to a pressure above the pressure within the reactor tube 20 so that the gases from the first compressor pump 60 enter the reactor tube 20 for reaction as described herein. A first line 63 connects to the outlet of the first compressor pump 60 and to the means 42 for introducing a fluid comprised of propylene into the mixture whereby the gas exiting the first compressor pump 60 is transferred Into the fluid comprised of propylene which is introduced into the reaction tube 20 . A second line 65 connects to the gas section 56 of the second gas liquid separator 55 and to the first compressor pump 60 whereby the gas from within the second gas liquid separator 55 transfers to the first compressor pump 60 . A second compressor pump 70 connects to the gas section 50 of the first gas liquid separator and to first line 63 which connects to the outlet of the first compressor pump 60 . The second compressor pump 70 boosts the pressure of the gas exiting the first gas liquid separator 45 to that above the pressure within the first line 63 whereby the gas from the first gas liquid separator 45 is recycled into the reactor tube 20 . A third line 75 connects to the first line 63 and to the outlet of the second compressor pump 70 whereby the gas from the second compressor pump is transferred into the gas from the first compressor 60 . A means 80 for removing the second liquid from the second gasliquid separator 55 is connected to the liquid section 57 whereby the second liquid which comprises liquid hydrogen fluoride and isobutyryl fluoride is removed from the apparatus reactor 10 . The second liquid can be transferred to a suitable storage tank or conveyor tank for further processing. Preferably, the second liquid is transferred to a separation means not shown such as a distillation unit whereby the isobutyryl fluoride and hydrogen fluoride are separated and the hydrogen fluoride is liquefied and transferred to the means 40 for introducing liquid hydrogen fluoride under pressure for recycling. The following examples will illustrate the process and apparatus of the invention. In the examples, which follow and use the process and apparatus described herein, carbon monoxide from the source 62 flows through the first compressor 60 into first line 63 where it is mixed with the gas mixture comprised of CO coming through third line 75 from the second compressor 70 . The gas mixture exiting first line 63 mixes with a fluid comprised of propylene from the means 42 for introducing propylene, to form a first fluid mixture which enters the front end 25 of the reactor tube 20 through ejection means 35 and mixes with the liquid hydrogen fluoride flowing into the front end 25 of the reactor tube 20 through the means 40 for introducing liquid hydrogen fluoride into the reactor tube 20 .The reaction mixture of gas liquid co currently reacts in reactor tube 20 to form isobutyryl fluoride and the product mixture comprised for example of unreacted propylene, carbon monoxide, hydrogen fluoride and isobutyryl fluoride and possible inerts passes into the first gas liquid separator 45 . The gas from the first separator 45 passes through the second compressor 70 where it is compressed and passed into first line 63 as mentioned above. The first liquid which has dissolved CO therein from the liquid section 51 of the first gas liquid separator 45 which has means for refrigeration passes through the reducing valve 58 and into the second gasliquid separator 55 . The gas from the gas section 56 of the second gasliquid separator 55 passes through the second line 65 into the first compressor 60 where it, together with make up carbon monoxide from a source 62 , is recycled for further reaction in reactor tube 20 as described herein. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the step b separation pressure is from about ninety 90 to ninety nine 99 percent of the reaction pressure of step a , and the step c separation pressure is from about one 1 to about fifteen 15 percent of the reaction pressure of step a . EXAMPLE 1 This example followed the procedure described above and the reaction is conducted at 37,9 bars, 45 C, at a propylene flow rate of 11278 g per hour and a carbon monoxide flow rate of 52573 g hour. The first compressor 60 is sized for a delta iX pressure of 37,5 1,0 bars. The second compressor 70 is sized by the high pressure transfer loop with delta b pressure of 3,45 bars. The amount of compression energy and refrigeration requirements duty as kilojoules per hour are shown in Table I. EXAMPLE 2 The example is similar to Example 1 except that the first compressor 60 is sized for a delta dj pressure of 172,4 1,0 bars. The high pressure loop for the second compressor 70 is sized for a pressure differential Op of 6,9 bars. The pressure of the reaction is 172,4 bars.

In these comparative examples, the apparatus used does not have a second compressor 70 , third line 75 , or a first gas liquid separator 45 . Instead, the product mixture from the reactor tube 20 passes through reducing valve 58 into the second gas liquid separator 55 .
