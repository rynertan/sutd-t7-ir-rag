# Mounting apparatus for dynamic convergence coils.

## Abstract
An apparatus for mounting dynamic convergence coils on the neck 28 of a cathode ray tube monitor. Two mount ing boards 12, 14 are provided as a mounting platform for the dynamic convergence coils 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44 . The mounting boards are pivotably joined so that they may be opened to provide clearance for installation and then closed to clamp onto the neck 28 of the cathode ray tube. Two elastomeric grommets 16, 18 are positioned between the mounting boards 12, 14 and the neck 28 of the cathode ray tube. When fastened together, the mounting boards compress the grommets against the neck. Suction cups on the grommets grip the neck to prevent movement of the mounting boards, and also deform to allow for dimensional variations of the neck.
