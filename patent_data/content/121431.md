# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR THE REMOVAL OF NOXIOUS ACIDIC GASES FROM A HOT EXHAUST GAS STREAM

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for removing noxious oxides of sulphur and nitrogen from a hot exhaust gas produced by burning fossil fuels and simultaneously producing a hot water stream essentially free of noxious acidic gases, suitable for district heating. The hot exhaust gas stream 8 is fed to an absorber 1 where it is counter currently contacted with a recirculation water stream 1 , an inlet water stream 14 and an alkali stream 16 to cool the hot exhaust gas then absorb the noxious oxides. A first water line 13 containing absorbed oxides leads from a catch tray beneath the absorber middle section 4 to a sub atmospheric pressure stripper 2 and a second water line 12 leads hot recirculation water from the absorber bottom to a flash pan 9 in the stripper. Due to the reduced pressure in the stripper 2 , the absorbed oxides are removed from the water and heat is transferred from the absorber to the stripper. All the heat energy required to oper ate the stripper is supplied to the system by the hot gases.
