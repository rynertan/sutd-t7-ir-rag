## Description
This invention relates to automated blood pressure measuring apparatus and, more particularly to stored program controlled monitors employing the oscillometric method of detection characterised by data purification and enhanced systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure determination. Reference is hereby made to the following concurrently filed co pending European patent applications Automated blood pressure monitoring has rapidly become an accepted and, in many cases, essential aspect of human and veterinary treatment. Such monitors are now a conventional part of the patient environment in emergency rooms, intensive and critical care units, and in the operating theatre. The so called oscillometric method of measuring blood pressure is one of the most popular methods in commercially available systems. This method relies on measuring changes in arterial counterpressure, such as imposed by an inflatable cuff, which is controllably relaxed or inflated. In some cases the cuff pressure change is continuous, and in others it is incremental. In substantially all, a transducer monitors arterial counterpressure oscillations, and processing apparatus converts select parameters of these oscillations into blood pressure data. The principles of the present invention are described in US 4360029 and US 4349034, which are commonly assigned with the instant invention. Both patents disclose apparatus and methods for artifact rejection in oscillometric systems. In accordance with the principles described in these patents, an inflatable cuff is suitably located on the limb of a patient, and is pumped up to a predetermined pressure. Thereupon, the cuff pressure is reduced in predetermined fixed decrements, at each level of which pressure fluctuations are monitored. These typically consist of a DC voltage with a small superimposed variational component caused by arterial blood pressure pulsations referred to herein as oscillatory complexes . Therefore, after suitable filtering to reject the DC component and to provide amplification, pulse peak amplitudes above a given threshold are measured and stored. As the decrementing continues, the peak amplitudes will normally increase from a lower amount to a relative maximum, and thereafter will decrease. The lowest cuff pressure at which the oscillations have a maximum peak value is representative of mean arterial pressure. The cuff pressures obtained when stored oscillation complex pulse peak amplitudes bear predetermined fractional relationships with the largest stored peak corresponding to the subject s systolic and diastolic pressures. US 4360029 and US 4349034 describe the rejection of artifact data to derive accurate blood pressure data. Indeed, as is apparent from Fig. 2 of both patents, the most substantial portion of the measurement cycle denominated T3 is devoted to the execution of complex detection at the various pressure levels, measurement of signal peaks of true complexes, and processing those peaks in accordance with artifact rejection algorithms. Notwithstanding such efforts, the signal peak data collected sometimes incorporates data errors, i.e., a data pattern inconsistent with the above described typical physiological response pattern of a subject as the artery occluding cuff pressure monotonically decreases. In EP A 0208520 which has the same priority date as the present invention, oscillometric blood pressure measurements are effected with non uniform, cuff pressure dependent pressure decrements between successive oscillatory complex peak measuring intervals. Such a method of effecting oscillometric blood pressure measurements is facilitated by systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure determining algorithms not heretofore employed. It is an object of the present invention to provide improved oscillometric blood pressure determining apparatus and methodology. More specifically, it is an object of the present invention to purify the oscillatory complex peak amplitude data ensemble employed for blood pressure determination. Yet another object of the present invention is the provision of improved algorithms, methodology and apparatus for determining systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure. A blood pressure cuff is applied about a subject s artery, and inflated above the systolic level thus fully occluding the artery for a full heart cycle. The cuff pressure is thereafter reduced to permit an increasing flow through the progressively less occluded artery, and a measure of the peak amplitudes of the successively encountered oscillatory complexes stored in memory. Also retained is the cuff pressure obtaining for each stored complex peak. In accordance with varying aspects of the present invention, the stored complex peak representing data set is corrected for aberrations and improved data processing operates on the stored and advantageously corrected pulse peak data and the corresponding cuff pressure information to determine the subject s systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure. According to the invention, there is provided an automated blood pressure monitor comprising an inflatable cuff means for inflating and deflating said cuff pressure transducer means coupled to said cuff for cuff pressure measurement means responsive to said cuff pressure measurement for generating a signal representing blood pressure pulses complex peak storing means for storing values characterising the peak amplitudes of said detected pulses at different cuff pressures cuff pressure storing means for storing the cuff pressures associated with said cuff pressure pulse peak signals and mean arterial pressure determining means, characterised in that said mean arterial pressure determining means comprises means for locating the maximum cuff pressure complex peak amplitude stored in said complex peak storing means means for locating a successor peak value stored in said complex peak storing means next occurring after said maximum complex peak amplitude means for selecting from said complex peak storing means, plural peak amplitudes generated at higher cuff pressures than that associated with said maximum complex peak amplitude and determining means for determining mean arterial pressure from said plural peak amplitudes and cuff pressures stored in said cuff pressure storing means associated with said selected plural peak amplitudes and said successor peak value. According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided means for identifying and maintaining the associated cuff pressure decrement levels means for interpolating the peak amplitudes from the identified associated cuff pressure decrement levels and said determining means further comprises means for developing mean arterial pressure as a predetermined weighted average of the cuff pressure corresponding to the interpolated peak amplitude and at least one of the identified and maintained cuff pressure decrement levels. The preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which US 4360029, US 4349034, US 4543962, and EP A 0208520 describe in detail the basic oscillometric method of measuring blood pressure forming a background and a starting point for the instant invention. An artery occluding cuff is disposed on the subject, e.g., about a subject s upper arm over the brachial artery. At the inception of a measuring cycle, the cuff is inflated to a pressure which fully occludes the brachial artery, i.e., prevents blood from flowing therethrough at any point in the heart cycle. The cuff is then progressively deflated, as in discrete steps. A pressure transducer is coupled to the internal cuff pressure and provides an analog signal characterising the blood pressure oscillatory complexes when they begin to occur i.e., when the maximum heart pressure corresponding to contraction of the heart s left ventricle exceeds the instantaneously obtaining artery occluding cuff pressure . The peak values of the complex signals are determined in hardware or software. As the measurement cycle progresses, the peak amplitude of the blood pressure complexes generally become monotonically larger to a maximum and then become monotonically smaller as the cuff pressure continues toward deflation. The peak amplitude of the cuff pressure oscillation complexes, and the corresponding occluding cuff pressure values are retained in computer memory. US 4360029, US 4349034, US 4543962 and EP A 0208520 illustrate previously employed algorithms for processing the stored blood pressure complex peak values and concomitant pressure values to yield the subject s mean arterial pressure. These patents and applications also furnish detailed procedures for measuring oscillatory complex peaks procedures for testing complexes and rejecting bad data associated with measurement impeding artifacts such as motion during a measurement cycle, and the like. The oscillometric blood pressure measurements as typified by the disclosed principles are effected under stored program control, as via a microprocessor operative in conjunction with a program containing read only memory ROM or PROM , and a variable content random access memory RAM which stores the cuff pressures, oscillatory complex peak amplitudes, and other processing operand variables. The microprocessor receives the cuff pressure readings generated by the pressure transducer, for example as processed by a peak detector, amplifier and analog to digital convertor, and supplies all output control signals required, e.g., to open and close one or more cuff deflating valves. The cuff may be inflated directly by an air pump and deflated in fixed, discrete steps under microprocessor control. Alternatively, the cuff may be principally or entirely inflated by the pressurised contents of an air reservoir and or deflation may proceed in variable, cuff pressure dependent steps via selected one or ones of plural deflating valves. These latter alternatives achieve the desideratum of condensing the time required for a composite measurement cycle of operation. Also, there are alternative procedures for measuring the oscillatory complex peak amplitude at any prevailing cuff pressure. In one mode heretofore employed, plural e.g., two complex peaks are measured at each cuff pressure step during cuff deflation, and their average used as the peak value. Since the peaks should be approximately equal, any marked disparity e.g., 20 signals that some artifact error occurred and the data is rejected. In a fast stat mode, after several intervals of qualifying close or equal peak values companion complexes are detected to develop measurement confidence, only one pulse is required during succeeding cuff deflation intervals thus speeding the composite measurement period. As alluded to above, it is sometimes the case when blood pressure complexes are being examined for peak amplitude at any occluding pressure level that improper data is developed. There are varying causes for such aberrations. Perhaps the most common is spurious motion by the subject which generates an inadvertent pressure impulse in the cuff which is sensed by the pressure transducer which may be then incorrectly reflected in the blood pressure measurement. Other causes include varying sources of interfering electrical noise or internal cardiac or respiratory changes in the subject. When a false complex peak amplitude value is generated, it is discarded by the composite measuring apparatus and a discard signalling value e.g., 1 retained in its place in memory. A second form of spurious data occurs when the pattern of stored pulse peak values departs from the physiologically mandated sequence of values which progressively increase to a peak and then progressively decrease. Attention will now be directed to data processing under stored program control for purifying the data collected by the above described blood pressure measuring apparatus. Further, specific illustrative efficient algorithms are discussed for in fact determining the subject s systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressures. Such data processing may be effected on any computing equipment, preferably digital microprocessors such as commercially available from a number of vendors. The program instructions and sequences presented below are for illustrative purposes only. Such instructions may in fact be implemented in any of diverse program languages and sequences readily apparent to those skilled in the art. In the signal processing below discussed, processing variables have the following significance Turning now to Fig. 1, there is depicted wave forms with associated data characterizing the generation of data for an oscillatory blood pressure measurement and purging overcoming bad data constituents. In accordance with the above discussion, the cuff artery occluding pressure for a measurement cycle, as measured by the cuff associated transducer is characterized by a wave form 10. The cuff pressure rapidly increases to a maximum above the subject s systolic pressure, and is then deflated in a sequence of steps to a point below the diastolic pressure. The sequence of cuff deflation steps is indicated by the time interval signalling digits 1,2, ... , lowest row 18 in the data table portion of Fig. 1 . The internal pressure characterizing the cuff pressure at each step Each step time interval is made sufficiently long to include at least two heart beats. Accordingly, at least two cuff pressure complex pulses 21 As above noted, assuming a perfect measurement, the oscillation pressure amplitude A I data row would not contain any 1 values which signify an impeded measurement. Further, the data pattern in the second row of the data table for the oscillation amplitudes would exhibit a pattern of successively increasing numbers to a peak value, followed by progressively decreasing values all without adjacent equal A I values. To the extent that any A I 1 values are stored, or to the extent that the progressively increasing decreasing pattern does not obtain, the data processing in accordance with the instant invention functions to compute appropriate corrected A I values the third data table row 15 in Fig. 1 for the oscillation amplitude entries requiring correction. In overview, where any A I 1 values exist, they are replaced by the average value of the oscillation amplitude in the two contiguous storage cells, i.e., Correspondingly, where two contiguous oscillation amplitudes have the proscribed equal values, the first of the contiguous equal pair is replaced by the average of the amplitudes of the complex peaks measured at the next lower and next higher occluding cuff pressures. See, for example, Eq. 1 and, more particularly, the comparable relationship in functional block 30 of Fig. 2. Data flow effecting the data purification algorithm above discussed is set forth in the program flow chart of Fig. 2. Fig. 2 operates on the measured average oscillation amplitudes the second data table row 14 in Fig. 1 and generates the corrected A I values shown in the third row 15 of Fig. 1. To this end, proceeding from a start block 10 Fig. 2 , step 15 reads the next value A I proceeding toward the right along the Fig. 1 data table row 14 and test 18 determines whether the value stored in A I equals the error signalling value 1. If as is the usual case it does not indicating that the value measured was presumptively free of artifacts and the like , control passes to equality test 27. However, if the contents of A I did equal 1 YES branch of test 18 , functional block 23 implements Eq. 1, i.e., replaces the 1 former contents of memory cell A I corresponding to cuff pressure CP I with the average value of the oscillation amplitude measured at the next lower A I 1 and next higher non plus one A I 1 deflation steps. The processing steps 18 and 23 thus purge the measured pressure peak amplitude storage contents row 14 of the Fig. 1 data table of all 1 values, replacing these by the average value of the measurements made during immediately adjacent deflation steps corrected A I contents being illustrated in row 15 . Test 27 next examines the current operand A I for the proscribed equality with the previous value A I 1 . If, as is normally the case, the contents of A I and A I 1 differ NO branch from test 27 , processing flows to test 32 to determine whether each of the N elements of A I have been processed. If they have not, control returns to block 15 to read in and process the next A I element of the array in the third row 15 of the Fig. 1 data table. When all elements have been processed, control exits from the Fig. 2 data purification routine to data processing point 33 to proceed with the next unrelated task for the microprocessor. If a data error has occurred YES output of test 27 signalling that a data value A I equaled the previous value , control passes to step 30 which replaces the assumed erroneous element A I 1 the value which should differ from A I but did not with the average of the two immediately contiguous elements, as by Accordingly, the data purification routine depicted in Fig. 2 and above discussed replaces all error reading signifying A I 1 values with an interpolated estimated value and purges the data table row 14 A I array of data of any contiguous equal values. The corrected set of A I is shown in row 15 of the Fig. 1 data table. Thus, for example, the oscillation amplitude value during the cuff pressure step time interval 4 is corrected from the error signalling 1 value to a peak amplitude 14, representing the average of measurements 4 and 25 at cuff pressures 25 kPa 187 Torr and 20.4 kPa 153 Torr during the immediately contiguous time intervals 3 and 5. Similarly, the first pressure step 6 of two equal measured oscillation amplitude pulses of value 63 during periods 6 and 7, corresponding to occluding cuff pressures of 18.7 kPa 140 Torr and 17.1 kPa 128 Torr , is corrected to a value of 44 representing the average of the contiguous measured amplitudes of 63 and 25 units. The corrected array A I as represented by row 15 in Fig. 1 thus comprises values from which each of the systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressures may be determined either in accordance with the improved algorithms below discussed or employing the algorithms of the above referenced patents and patent applications. The data purification above discussed provides more accurate measurements than was heretofore the case and also permits blood pressures to be determined more quickly, obviating the need for repeated deflation steps when unacceptable artifact or noise corrupted data is sensed. Attention will now be shifted to the particular method pursuant to which the stored cuff pressure CP I and corrected blood pressure peak value A I information in the first row and in row 15 of Fig. 1 is employed in accordance with other aspects of the present invention to measure a subject s systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressures. Pulse complex wave form processing typifying systolic blood pressure determination is illustrated in Fig. 3, and a flow chart for the underlying data processing is set forth in Fig. 4. In overview, systolic pressure is determined by Thus, for example, the following schematic BASIC sequence will suffice as illustrative to find the interval MAX In brief, Equations 4 and 5 make an initial assumption that the peak value occurred during the first interval and load a provisional peak value storing variable AMAX with the value A 1 . For an assumed N time interval measurement, the loop between Equations 6 and 10 sequentially examines every element of the A I array from 2 to N, updating AMAX only when the value A K K being the loop index exceeds the previously assumed AMAX value. When the processing exits from the loop following instruction 70 in Equation 10 the variable MAX contains the value of I such that A MAX is the largest value in the array. The next following step 42 sets a variable LVL equal to the predetermined fraction of the peak amplitude A MAX as by The value LVL is shown by the dashed line 50 in Fig. 3. The next following operation 45 finds the first time interval L preceding MAX for which the oscillation amplitude peak is less than LVL, i.e., less than one half of the peak value A MAX , thereby finding the two contiguous values L, L 1 having peak amplitudes which bound the value in LVL. Algorithms for conducting such a search are well known to those skilled in the art, e.g., Equations 12 15 simply comprise a DO or FOR NEXT loop progressing from MAX 1 toward L 1, exiting when the first sub LVL value is obtained. The appropriate interval identification MAX J is stored in the variable location L. Finally, the value of the systolic pressure is estimated by assuming a linear variation in cuff pressure between the values CP L and CP L 1 , and a linear variation between the corresponding oscillation amplitude A L and A L 1 . Thus, in accordance with the To illustrate employing the data of Fig. 1, 50 of the peak amplitude 9.33 is 4.67, and thus the pulse complex measurements of time intervals 5 and 6 are selected for systolic pressure computation. The Eq. 16 software interpolation implementation yields Pulse complex wave form processing characterizing diastolic blood pressure determination is illustrated in Fig. 6 and a flow chart for the underlying diastolic data processing algorithm is depicted in Fig. 7. In overview, diastolic pressure is determined by The above described procedure is illustrated in the blood pressure complex depiction of Fig. 6 and the Fig. 7 flow chart. The peak A MAX is first located as by the processing of Equations 4 10. The upper and lower peak amplitude fractions DIAU and DIAL are next determined steps 64 and 65 of Fig. 7 corresponding to the labeled horizontal dash lines in Fig. 6 . Step 69 then finds the first time interval UD following MAX at which the peak amplitude A UD is lower than the value stored in DIAU as by processing analogous to that of Equations 12 through 15 replacing MAX J with MAX J . Thereafter, step 72 performs the trapezoidal interpolation analogous to that of Fig. 5, determining the cuff pressure DIAU corresponding to the UDLVL complex amplitude value. It is observed that the time interval UD 1 coincides with the interval MAX when the peak complex value occurred since, for the data case illustrated, the first pulse complex following MAX less than 0.69 x A MAX occurred in the next time interval MAX 1. The functional steps 73 and 74 of Fig. 7 perform in a manner directly analogous to operations 69 and 72, locating the cuff pressure DIAL by interpolation for the intervals when the peak complex amplitudes bound the LDLVL value equal A MAX times 0.55. This latter search is conducted from A i at the lowest cuff pressure, then working toward higher cuff pressures. Finally, the subject s diastolic pressure DIA is computed as the average of the contents stored in DIAU and DIAL step 82 . To illustrate with a numerical example, again employing the data portion of Fig. 1, Finally, wave form processing illustrating mean arterial blood pressure measurement is shown in Fig. 8, and in flow chart form for the corresponding data processing in Fig. 9. In summary, mean arterial pressure is determined by The denominator 2.9 in Eq. 26 may be somewhat lower for operation in a stat mode, e.g., 2.85. The above discussed algorithm for determining mean arterial pressure is illustrated in Figs. 8 and 9. Step 101 Fig. 9 finds the peak interval MAX for example, by execution comparable to Equations 4 10 . A processing variable AMP is set equal to the peak value A MAX 1 of the complex following the interval MAX step 105 and the interval MN1 is next determined step 106 as the first occurring complex less than the value AMP i.e., A MAX 1 to the left of time MAX in Fig. 8 e.g., by processing comparable to Equations 12 15 . An interpolation is then conducted to find the point MAPL Fig. 8 step 111 in Fig. 9 and the final processing operation 113 finds the subject s mean arterial pressure by implementing Equation 26. To again illustrate by numerical example from the Fig. 1 data The foregoing discussion has thus demonstrated that measured data may be enhanced by replacing data lost through measurement artifacts or the like or deviations from a proper data pattern by approximated values. Specific data processing algorithms were presented and discussed for the computation of a subject s measured systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressures. The above described arrangements are merely illustrative of the principles of the present invention. Numerous modifications and adaptations thereof will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope of the present invention as claimed. For example, the pressure measurement mode is described above as stepped deflation from an initial inflation above the subject s systolic pressure. The measurement of the instant invention can alternatively be performed by stepped inflation from an initial sub diastolic cuff pressure or via continuous vis a vis discrete cuff inflation or deflation.
