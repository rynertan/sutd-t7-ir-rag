## Description
Short title Hand scissors The invention relates to hand scissors, comprising two relatively pivotable blades having cooperating cutting edges and operating means adapted to be gripped by the hand. Such a hand scissors is known. The disadvantage of the prior art hand scissors is that in cutting relatively hard materials they become blunt in,an intolerably short time, causing the scissors to have to be sharpened over and over, or preventing their use, so that one has to take his refuge in other techniques. An example is the cutting of fibres, e.g. those which are commercialized under the trade name Arenka by the Firm Enka Glanzstoff, and Kevlar of the Firm Dupontde Nemours. Such fibres are used and will in the future in an increasing degree be used for among others reinforcement of glass fibre cables for telecommunication purposes. For such an application it is necessary that glass fibre cables can in situ be readily worked for coupling with endapparatus, connection with other cables etc. Thereto preferably a hand scissors is used. Prior art scissors are,due to the very high hardness of the fibres involved already after some cutting operations utterly unusable. Even the cutting of domestic paper containing fibres gives problems in connection with the rapidly becoming blunt of a hand scissors. In order to increase the standing time of the prior art hand scissors the cutting angle of the cutting edges is usually chosen only a little smaller than 900 This causes the effectiveness of the cutting operation to be not very great, so that a relatively large cutting force has to be exerted with the hand. Purpose of the invention is to relieve the mentioned disadvantages and limitations of the prior art and in view thereof the invention provides a hand scissors of the type described, of which said cutting edges consist of hardmetal. This hardmetal may be tungsten carbide. A very great effectiveness of the cutting operation whilst maintaining a long standing time is obtained, if the cutting angle of said cutting edges is smaller than 0 500. In order to avoid that the scissors according to the invention will become too expensive by making the blades including the cutting edges fully of hardmetal, advantageously the cutting edges may be made in the form as strips of hardmetal adhered to said blades. In this case e.g. the cutting edges are adhered to said blades by hard soldering. Also other connecting methods may be used. The invention will now be explained with reference to the drawing of an arbitrary embodiment. In the drawing show Fig. 1 a perspective view of a hand scissors Fig. 2 a section along the line II II inFig. 1 Fig. 3 a perspective view of a variant and Fig. 4 a perspective view of the variant according to Fig. 3 seen from the other side. Fig. 1 shows a hand scissors 1, comprising two relatively, round a pivot shaft 2 pivotable blades 3, 4 having cooperating cutting edges, 5 and 6, respectively, in which hand grips 7, 8 are present at the end directed away from the cutting edges 5, 6 relatively to the pivotshaft 2. The cutting edges 5, 6 comprise strips 9, 10 of tungsten carbide. The strips 9, 10 are in the way shown inFig. 2 embedded in blades 3, 4 and connected therewith by hardsoldering, in such a way that they are fully received in the profile. At the blade 4 in Fig. 2 the cutting angle 11 is shown. In this embodiment this angle has a value of about 400. The hand scissors 2 can also comprise blades fully consisting of hard metal. Further the blades may be urged from one another by spring force, in which the operating means can, in deviation of the embodiment according toFig. 1, be positioned at the side of the cutting edges relatively to the pivot middlepoint. Fig. 3 shows a so called one ring scissors 11 having relatively pivotable blades 12, 13 of synthetic resin, which by means of screws 14 strips 15, 16 of hard metal are connected. These strips 15, 16 carry cutting edges 17, 18, respectively. The blade 12 carries a ring 19, which is intended to receive the ring finger, and a flat part 20 for cooperation with the middle finger and fore finger. The blade 13 carries a flat part 21 intended to receive a pressure exerted thereof by the thumb. Blades 12, 13 are urged away from one another by a screw spring 22 indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 4.
