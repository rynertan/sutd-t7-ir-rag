# PACKET SWITCHING SYSTEM

## Abstract
In a packet switching system in which speech is packetised, voice activity detectors VAD s 2,3 are used to monitor speech in the GO and RETURN paths. In the GO path, the VAD 2 compares the current level of packets with a the current background noise value, and b the computed value of the expected echo due to speech packets in the RETURN path. If the GO path packet is larger than the parameter of a and b by a preset arrangement the packet is sent, otherwise it is not. If the send decision persists for a number of speech packets, that send condition has a hangover period attached to it. If the parameters are properly chosen, then the speech as heard by a subscriber is not unduly affected.
