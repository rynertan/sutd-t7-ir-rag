# Method and apparatus for controlling an automatic clutch.

## Abstract
Apparatus for controlling the operation of a clutch 2 in a motor vehicle so that the clutch automatically disconnects the gear transmission 6 from the engine 1 , comprises pressure sensitive switches SW1 SW4 which detect the braking force applied to a braking system 12, 12a , and an engine speed sensor 10 . Monitored parameters of the braking force, and the engine speed, are fed to a control unit 9 which stores data for comparison therewith. As a result of the comparison, the control unit determines whether the clutch should be rapidly disengaged and, if so, applies a command signal to a clutch actuator 3 . Whether or not the clutch is to be rapidly disen gaged is preferably ascertained on the basis of a combination of the detected braking force and the detected engine speed, or a detected rate of increase of the braking force, so that the engine is prevented from being stalled as a result of, for example, rapid depression of the brake pedal.
