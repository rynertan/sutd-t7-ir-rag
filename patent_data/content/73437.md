# Dyed polyester fiber composite structure.

## Abstract
A dyed polyester fiber composite structure having an enhanced brilliance and or color depth, comprises A a dyed porous polyester fiber which has been produced 1 by preparing a polyester resin from a dicarboxylic acid com ponent and a glycol component in the presence of a pore forming agent containing 0.3 to 3 molar of at least one phosphorus compound based on the molar amount of the dicarboxylic acid component, 2 by converting the polyester resin to a polyester fiber in which fine particles of the pore forming agent are dispersed, by treating the polyester fiber with an aqueous alkali soludion so that at least 2 of the weight of the fiber is removed and a number of fine pores are formed in the fiber and 4 by dying the porous polyester fiber and B a coating layer on the peripheral surface of the dyed porous polyester fiber, comprising a polymeric ma terial having a smaller refractive index than that of the porous polyester fiber.
