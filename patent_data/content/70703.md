# Polyester conjugate crimped yarns, process for preparation thereof, and polyester stretch fabrics.

## Abstract
Polyester conjugate crimped yarns prepared by conju gate spinning 1 an A component substantially comprising polybuty lene terephthalate and 2 a B component substantially comprising polyethylene terephthalate at a weight ratio of 30 70 to 70 30 in a side by side eccentric sheath core arrangement, rendered crimpable by false twist ing to a degree of crimpability TC₁₀ of 8 or more when sub jected to a boiling water treatment under a load of 10 mg de. The polyester conjugate crimped yarn can be obtained by sub jecting the conjugate yarn to single heater false twisting under the conditions which satisfy the following relations i TW 24380 Stretch woven fabrics having a stretch percentage of 15 or more can be obtained by weaving the above mentioned poly ester conjugate crimped yarns.
