# Package for oil containing products.

## Abstract
An improved package for an oil containing product is made from a multiple layer packaging sheet material which includes a layer 28 susceptible to swelling when in contact with oil, giving a cockled appearance. Cockling is prevented, however, because the sheet material also includes an oil barrier layer 24 between the oil containing product and the oil susceptible layer 28 . The barrier layer 24 preferably comprises either nylon or an ethylene vinyl alcohol copolym er, and the oil susceptible layer is usually high density polyethylene or a blend thereof.
