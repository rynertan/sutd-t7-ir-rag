# Low dispersion infrared glass.

## Abstract
The present invention teaches infrared chalcogenide glass compositions having very low dispersion in the eight to twelve micron range, which are formed as III V VI VII com positions. e.g. 14 atomic gallium plus 25 antimony plus 40 selenium plus 21 bromine. The introduction of a group VII component into a chalcogenide glass provides low dispersion, and the group III component compensates for the strong devitrification tendencies of the group VII component and maintains the mechanical properties of the glass. A lens such as a lens triplet 12 is included in an infrared optical system before an infrared detector 20 for separating the IR energy 10 into at least two widely separated wavelengths within a selected, for example, 8 to 12 micron range of wavelengths and imaged in coincidence on the detector 20 . The lens triplet includes two converging lenses 14 and 16 having a diverging lens 18 in between. The converging lenses 14 and 16 are composed of the above mentioned infrared chalcogenide glass composition and the diverging lens 18 is a ZnS, ZnSe, or Texas Instruments designated 1173 glass.
