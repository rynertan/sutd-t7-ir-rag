# A multiprocessor resource locking system and its method of operation.

## Abstract
In a multiprocessor resource locking system the transi tion table size and table driven locking facilities is reduced by decomposing lock states into canonical states and canonical actual maps, mapping actual processors to canonical proces sors, locking up a transition in a table 17 which contains a new canonical state, notify bits and a canonical canonical map, permuting the canonical actual map using the canonic al canonical map, and permuting the notify bits using the original canonical actual map.
