# Reagent for detecting antigen.

## Abstract
The invention relates to reagents for detecting antigen contained in body fluid or urine according to the immunological agglutination or agglutination inhibition reaction and compris ing an antibody adsorbed on fine carrier particle to be sensitized as an effective constituent, and is characterized by acylating said antibody. Owing to such acylation, the reagent can correctly detect antigen without any influence of substance contained in sam ple which has inevitably caused nonspecific agglutination reac tion according to the prior art.
