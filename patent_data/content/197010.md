## Description
Process for the preparation of cake mixes sponge to be oven baked, for storage and consumption at low temperature. The invention described herein relates to a process for the preparation of sweet cake mixes sponge, in particular which are oven baked, then stored and consumed at low temperature.For some time now the ice cream industries have been moving toward the manufacture of sweets and gateaux in which ice creams in a variety of flavours are packaged together with oven baked cake, sponge in particular. Such products must be stored at sub zero temperature, generally between 12 and 18 OC, and this gives rise to the problem of preparing a sponge which will remain soft and springy even at such low temperatures.To this end, sponge cake mixes for ultimate use by the ice cream industry must contain minimal percentages of free water which, when frozen, crystallizes into ice and thus causes the sponge to stiffen.In order to ensure that such water is bonded with other ingredients of the mix, recourse is made in general to large proportions of egg, which offers marked emulsifying properties, also, to supersifted flours that permit of better water retention and form a flexible reticular structure, as well as to moisturizing agents such as glycerine, sorbitol and polyalcohols in general, which allow of maintaining a given moisture content and thus improve softness of the product at the low temperatures in question.These contrivances are not sufficient, in general, to guarantee embodiment of a product that will stay soft and spongy at low temperature indeed it is almost invariably the case that sponge cake produced with these methods hardens considerably during cold storage, and that consumption following de freeze is beset with problems, as well as being disagreeable.In most instances, one has to wait for the sponge to de freeze completely before consumption is possible.Two different processes are currently adopted by way of which to defeat the problems associated with consumption on the one hand, soaking the sponge in an alcoholic solution such that it will not freeze, and therefore remain softer on the other, stepping up the sugar content drastically, such that freezing point of the sponge is lowered.Both these processes betray serious drawbacks however. The primary effect of soaking sponge cake in alcoholic solutions is to weaken its structure, and cause it to crumble in temperatures of the order in question in addition, alcohol content in ice cream cakes and sweets is not widely appreciated, and at all events is not particularly suitable, especially where the consumers are young children.The incorporation of a high percentage of sugar into sponge mix has the effect of bringing about a marked change in the sweetness of the end product, which is not always agreeable. Whatever the exact percentage, too sweet may work to the product s disadvantage, not only in terms of taste, but also of rejection on the grounds of diet, which is often psychologically motivated.The object of the invention described herein is to overcome the drawbacks aforementioned by providing a process that permits of preparing a sponge cake for storage and consumption at low temperature which is free of alcoholic solutions moreover, sweetness of the end product is controlled and ensured agreeable to the consumer, and hardening of the sponge at low temperature is avoided.A singular advantage of the process claimed is that it permits of obtaining a sponge cake that will not crumble, even at the low temperatures in question.The stated object and advantage, and other advantages besides, are realized by the process disclosed, which is of the type wherein a mix is prepared from the following ingredients egg, sugar, flour, yeast, fats, emulsifying and moisturizing agents and aromas, and is characterized in that added sugar contains monosaccharides and disaccharides in a ratio varying between 0.25 and 0.50, and polysaccharides in proportion varying between 0 and 1.5 of the mix overall, by weight also, in that fats utilized are for the most part of non hydrogenated polyunsaturated composition.The different steps of the process will now be described in detail, by way of example, and implying no limitation. The process claimed herein envisages preparation of a mix from ingredients conventionally used for mixes of the type, namely egg, sugar, flour, yeast, fats, emulsifying and moisturizing agents, and aromas.Percentage quantities of the single ingredients will be as per conventional recipes for sponge cake, and will take account of the taste characteristics it is wished to obtain more precisely, the overall amount of sugar will be kept within limits, i.e. those prescribed for a sponge not intended for freezing, so as not to render the end product excessively sweet.To ensure that the baked sponge will not harden and crumble when frozen, added sugar will contain monosaccharides and disaccharides in a ratio of between 0.25 and 0.50 moreover, the percentage of polysaccharides therein will be variable between 0 and 1.5 of the mix overall, by weight.Extensive experiment has demonstrated that it is not so much the overall quantity of added sugar that invests such frozen products with greater softness and springiness, but rather, a correct ratio between the mono , di and polysaccharides present in the sugar.It has been found that best results are ensured with a mono and di saccharide ratio of 0.30, with polysaccharides accounting for 0.9 of the mix overall, by weight.It should be pointed out that the percentages thus illustrated relate to added sugar only, irrespective of the percentage of sugar carbohydrates present in other substances such as starch or fecula. Another feature of the process is that it envisages the adoption of a specific type of fats. Sponge mix prepared in accordance with the process will contain non hydrogenated polyunsaturated fats such fats are able to give the frozen end product the right amount of body, without producing a stodgy structure. More precisely, a mixture of fats is adopted that amounts to between 3 and 10 of the mix overall, by weight, and consists of 50 sunflower oil and 50 soya bean oil. The overall quantity of fats is not fundamental to results in the way that the quality of such fats is fundamental nonetheless, best results have been achieved with an inclusion of 3 to 5 fats overall in the mix. It should be pointed out that the percentages thus illustrated relate to added fats only, irrespective of the percentage present in other ingredients, such as egg.Special attention is paid to mixing the ingredients the sequence of steps adopted will now be described.First, egg and sugar are beaten together to the end of producing a thorough whip, well aerated. The rest of the ingredients are then added, minus the fats, and stirred briskly in the mixer speed 3 until the requisite density is achieved, quantifiable between 500 and 550g per litre. The fats are then worked in with the mixer stirring rather slower speed 1 .The mix is then baked in batches of size and weight to suit packaging requirements, with oven times and temperatures selected accordingly. A disc of between 6 and 8mm thickness would be baked at 190 210 C for some 6 minutes.Once baked, the sponge cake can be packaged together with ice cream for consumption as sweets, the endproduct being refrigerated between 12 and 18 OC approx with no fear whatever of the sponge freezing through or crumbling. The sponge component of such an end product can be consumed direct from the refrigerator without waiting for de freeze, thanks to its ability to remain soft and springy.Laboratory tests were carried out on six different sample mixes, in which the respective proportions of monosaccharides, disaccharides, polysaccharides and fats were as indicated in table 1 attached.Results of the laboratory tests are shown in table 2 attached, which both indicates the monosaccharidedisaccharide ratio M D , and gives the results of penetrometer tests, expressed in mm min, and organoleptic tests, expressed as a mark between 0 and 10.The penetrometer test was implemented adopting GuyWrass methods, utilizing Rheon III apparatus. Values indicated, in millimetres, reflect the penetration of an aluminium cone into a section of sponge cake of standard thickness.The organoleptic test was empirical, but meaningful nonetheless the samples were tasted by different subjects, who were asked to estimate agreeability of each one by way of a O to lO points scale.Table 3 shows the complete recipes used for sample mixes 4, 5 and 6, which gave the best results. Best results outright were given by sample 6.In table 3, the disaccharides are admixed as saccharose, whereas glucose syrup and dextrose provide the monosaccharides. In general, use is made of glucose syrups with a high fructose content, normally known as isoglucoses. Polysaccharides are contained in the syrups utilized.Beside the fact that penetration and organoleptic indexes are extremely satisfying for samples 4, 5 and 6, most especially 6, it will be noted that the sponge cake obtained by way of the process is in no way subject to crumbling at low temperature, a property which enables its utilization not only for the traditional types of ice cream cake where sponge is amalgamated or layered with ice cream, but also for sweets featuring an outer wrapping, or turnover of sponge, which envelops an ice cream filling. Folding of the sponge is made possible, clearly enough, by virtue of its ability to deform without breaking or crumbling when frozen, unlike traditional sponge. The rheological properties of sponge cake obtained by implementation of the process disclosed therefore render it ideal for manufacturing methods utilizing automatic plant, by which it may be conveyed mechanically, folded, and subjected to other stresses.
