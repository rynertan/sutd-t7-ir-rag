## Abstract
For co molding a plurality of articles from a plurality of polymeric materials, a preferred molding apparatus has a plurality of valve controlled co injection nozzles 296 and injection cavities 102 . The polymeric materials A to E are melted and fed from their sources 202, 204, 206 by screw extruders 214, 216, 218 to a set of rams 232, 234, 252, 260, 262 which appropriately pressurize and move streams of the polymeric materials to feed blocks 296 each associated with or forming part of a respective nozzle 296 for injection into the related cavity 102 . The streams leaving the rams 232, 234, 252, 260, 262 are conveyed along respective runner ducts 220, 222, 250, 257, 258 to a runner extension member 276 in a runner block 288 , and in the runner extension each material stream is divided into a plurality of branch streams. Each branch stream is ducted to flow splitters in the runner block 288 for further division into plural feed streams equal in number to the number of nozzles 296 , and the separate feed streams are then fed one to each nozzle 296 . The apparatus is configured such that for each material, the plural feed streams reach their respective nozzles 296 after pas sage along ductings of the same length and geometry to ensure that the streams enter their nozzles as nearly as poss ible in the same condition, ready for injection. Each nozzle 296 receives the polymeric materials A to E as separate feed streams and combines them appropriately into a plural layer, plural material stream for injection. The nozzles all have pin and sleeve valves 800, 834 to control admission and flow of the different materials to their central channels 240 wherein the combined stream is formed. Valve operation is under microprocessor control 2040 and the valves which are effectively substantially identical are coupled to com mon valve actuating cams 850, 856 for operation in unison, so that at any instant in the molding cycle the combined streams formed in the nozzle 296 for injection are as near as possible identical to one another. By appropriately controlling the pressure of the polymeric material streams and by appropriately controlling the timing of valve operating movements, precise control is obtainable whereby e.g. inter nal layers of the injected articles are positioned where best suited depending on the service required of the articles. The method and apparatus are applicable to the produc tion of injection or injection blow molded articles such as containers for commestibles and beverages.
