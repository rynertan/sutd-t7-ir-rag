# FEEDBACK AMPLIFIER

## Abstract
A feedback amplifier circuit includes an inversion circuit 11, 12 , a level shift circuit 1 , and a feedback resistive ele ment R₁ . The inversion circuit includes an input active ele ment 12 and a load element 11 connected in cascade with respect to an electrical source. The level shift circuit 1 includes a field effect transistor 13 having a gate connected to the output of the inversion circuit 11, 12 , a diode or diodes D₁ ... D
