# A method for forming a green body for a ceramic arc tube used for a metal vapor discharge lamp and a molding die for forming said green body.

## Abstract
A green body for a ceramic arc tube for a metal vapor dis charge lamp is successfully produced with the outer diameter of the arc discharging portion larger than that of the electrode holding ends. A stiff plastic body of a ceramic material and a thermosetting binder is extruded into a straight tubular body 3 which is placed in a previously heated molding die 13, 14 having a cavity of the desired shape. A compressed fluid is supplied via one end of the tubular body 5 into the interior thereof to inflate the central portion into contact with the inner surface of the die. The inflated body is hardened and dried us ing the heat of the die. Good dimensional precision is achieved and the resulting arc tube, after firing has a high transmittance.
