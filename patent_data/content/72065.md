# AGENTS FOR PREPARING CROSS LINKED POLYMERS AND PAINT AND PLASTIC COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THOSE AGENTS

## Abstract
A class of polymer precursor materials, which, under appropriate conditions, react to form cross linked polymers, is disclosed. These materials contain a back bone segment, such as polyacrylate, having a pendant therefrom mono or disubstituted olefinic groups, such as vinyl itaconate, having specific polymerization rates. This class of materials, especially when coupled with specifically defined oxygen activated catalyst systems, provide paint and plastic compositions which exhibit excellent film formation, strength and durability charac teristics.
