## Description
DESCRIPTION S ORAQBOUS s. The invention relates to a nonaqueous cell. The development of high energy battery systems requires the compatibility of an electrolyte possessing desirable electrochemical properties with highly reactive anode materials, such as lithium, sodium, and the like and the efficient use of high energy density cathode materials such as iron compounds. The use of aqueous electrolytes is precluded in these systems since the anode materials are sufficiently active to react with water chemically. It has, therefore, been necessary, in order to realize the high energy density obtainable through use of these highly reactive anodes and high energy density cathodes, to turn to the investigation of nonaqueous electrolyte systems and more pgarticularly to nonaqueous organic electrolyte systems. The term 1nonaqueous organic electrolyte in the prior art refers to an electrolyte which is composed of a solute, for example, a salt or complex salt ofGroup 1 A, Group II A or Group III A elements of thePeriodic Table, dissolved in an appropriate nonaqueous organic solvent. Conventional solvents include propylene carbonate, ethylene carbonate or butyrolactone. A multitude of solutes is known and recommended for use but the selection of a suitable solvent has been particularly troublesome since many of those solvents which are used to prepare electrolytes sufficiently conductive to permit effective ion migration through the solution are reactive with the highly active anodes mentioned above. Most investigators in this area, in search of suitable solvents, have concentrated on aliphatic and aromatic nitrogen and oxygen containing compound with some attention given to organic sulfur , phosphorus and arsenic containing compounds.The results of this search have not been entirely satisfactory since many of the solvents investigated still could not be used effectively with high energy density cathode materials, such as ferrous disuifide FeS2 , and were sufficiently corrosive to lithium anodes to prevent efficient performance over any length of time. U. S. Patent 3,778,310 discloses the use of halides, oxides or sulfides of, for example, we FeS,FeS2 as cathodes in ether based electrolytes. U. S.Patent 3,775,182 discloses iron sulfides as one group of cathode materials for use in solvent systems containing a trihydrocarbyl carbamate solvent component.Japanese published unexamined application 79 137,631 discloses an Li FeS cell having a PC DME LiC104 electrolyte solution. Propylene carbonate and dimethoxyethane have been employed as solvents for a wide range of solutes as disclosed in U. S. Patent 4,158,723. Specifically, this patent discloses an Li PbO cell containing Bi203, Sb2O3 or SnO2 additive in the PbO cathode and an electrolyte of a mixture of an ether e.g., dimethoxyethane and an ester e.g., propylene carbonate with a solute such as lithium trifluoromethane sulfonate. Although ferrous disulfide has been mentioned as a cathode material for certain cell systems, it is not always possible to predict whether it would effectively and efficiently function as a cathode in other systems.Thus while the theoretical energy, i.e., the electrical energy potentially available from a selected anodecathode couple, is relatively easy to calculate, there is a need to choose a nonaqueous electrolyte for a couple that permits the actual energy produced by an assembled battery to approach the theoretical energy.The problem usually encountered is that it is practically impossible to predict in advance how well, if at all, a nonaqueous electrolyte will function with a selected couple. Thus a cell must be considered as a unit having three parts a cathode, an anode, and an electrolyte, and it is to be understood that the parts of one cell are not predictably interchangeable with parts of another cell to produce an efficient and workable cell. The invention provides a novel high energy density nonaqueous cell comprising a highly active metal anode, an iron sulfur compound cathode such as FeS2 and a liquid organic electrolyte comprising lithium trifluoromethane sulfonate dissolved in propylene carbonate and dimethoxyethane. The cell of the invention may have one or more of the following properties i excellent cathode utilization at room texperature conditions, ii good pulse discharge capabilities, and iii excellent stability against electrolyte decorosition. Preferably, the iron sulfur compound should be mixed with a conductive agent such as graphite, carbon or the like and a binder such as Teflon trademark for polytetrafluoroethylene , ethylene acrylic acid copolymer or the like to produce a cohesive cathode If desired, a small amount of the electrolyte can be incorporÅated into the cathode mix. The specific electrolyte of this invention, PC DME LiCF3SO3, has been found to be an extremely stable electrolyte for lithium cells that permits excellent FeS2 utilization.Although there are hundreds of electrolyte solutions for use in nonaqueous cell systems, many will not provide efficient cathode utilization and many may not efficiently function with FeS2 containing cathodes. The ratio of propylene carbonate to dimethoxyethane ba sed on the solvent volume can vary from about 80 20 to 20 80 and is preferably about 50 50. The lithium trifluoromethane sulfonate can vary from about 0.5 molar up to its saturation in the electrolyte solution and preferably is about 1 molar concentration. Generally, the conductivity should be at least 10 3 ohm 1 cm 1. Highly active metal anodes suitable for this invention include lithium Li , potassium K , sodium Na , calcium Ca , magnesium Mg , aluminum Al , and their alloys. Of these active metals, lithium would be preferred because in addition to being a ductile, soft metal that can easily be assembled in a cell, it possesses the highest energy to weight ratio of the group of suitable anode metals. EXAMPLE I Fifteen milliliters of 0 an electrolyte solution were prepared from 1M LiCF3S03 in a 50 50 volume ratio of propylene carbonate and dimethoxyethane.Samples of the electrolyte were stored for 31 days and revealed no change in color. A lithium strip was placed ssn some of the electrolyte samples and after 31 days showed no color variation in the electrolyte solution and only a very slight discoloration of the lithium strip. FeS2 was placed in some of the electrolyte samples and after 31 days the electrolyte solution was observed to have only 8 very slight color change and or a cloudy appearance. In some additional samples of the electrolyte, a lithium strip and FS, were placed. After 31 days this electrolyte solution exhibited no change in color and only a very slight discoloration of the lithium strip. These tests clearly indicated the stability of the electrolyte solution when used in conjunction with a lithium anode and an FeS2 cathode. EXAMPLE II Two test cells were constructed each using a cathode consisting of 0.6 gram mix containing 80 by weight of FeS2, 10 by weight graphite, 3 by weight acetylene black and 7 by weight of a latex binder, a lithium anode 0.2 gram , a separator of nonwoven polypropylene, and about 2.0 ml of an electrolyte consisting of about 1M LiCF3S03 in a 50 50 volume ratio of propylene carbonate and dimethoxyethane Each cell was continuously discharged across a 3K ohm load and, at certain intervals, the cell was pulse discharged across a 125 ohm load fox two seconds. The results observed are shown in Table 1 along with the per centFeS2 efficiency to a 1.0 volt cutoff. The data show the relatively constant pulse voltages obtained using the cell of this invention even after 33 days.The per cent FeS2 efficiency to 1.0 volt cutoff which was close to but not exceeding 100 shows the stability of the electrolyte solution in the cell system, i.e., the components of the electrolyte solution did not effectively undergo electrochemical reduction.

EXAMPLE III Two test cells were constructed as in Example II except that polytetrafluoroethylene was employed as the binder for the cathode mix. The cells were subjected to the same type test and the data obtained are shown in Table 2.Again, the data show the relatively constant pulse voltages obtainable using the cell of this invention and the stability of the electrolyte solution in the cell.
