# Easy open can end with pull tab having retained tear strip with stress relief means.

## Abstract
An easy open can end 1 having a retained tear strip 4 extending diametrically part way across the can end 1 defined by a score line 5 of non uniform depth, and a graspable pull tab 9 , which may include fulcrum elements, one on either side of the center line of the pull tab 9 , secured to the tear strip 4 . Lifting of the pull tab 9 initiates tearing of the score line 5 which may be continued to form an opening in the can end 1 . When the pull tab 9 is pressed inwardly to a stored position against the can end 1 , if desired, the tear strip 4 doubles back upon itself to form an arcuate portion in the tear strip 4 lying beneath the surface of the can end which operates to relieve stress and prevent metal fracture of the tear strip 4 which could cause the strip to become separated from the can end 1 .
