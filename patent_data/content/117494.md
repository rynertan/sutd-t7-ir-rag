# Speed control device for stepping motor.

## Abstract
A speed control device for a stepping motor is disclosed which is possible to freely control the running speed of the stepping motor when driving it in a closed loop. Its mechanism is designed to be possible to decide which excitation phase to be excited according to a phase difference between the output signals emitted from the encoder and the speed variable reference clock signals and to make the run ning speed of the stepping motor follow to the instruction of said reference clock signals.
