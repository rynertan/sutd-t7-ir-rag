# Flow controlled pressure regulating device.

## Abstract
A device comprising fluid receiving means 40 for receiving the delivered fluid at a determinable flow rate from a pump, spray tip means 50 in fluid communication with the fluid receiving means 40 for receiving the delivered fluid at a predeterminable flow rate from a pump, spray tip means 50 in fluid communication with said fluid receiving means 40 which comprises a hollow body 48 having a fluid passage 90 therethrough, valve means 86, 110, 112 for selectively opening and closing said fluid passage 90 and for establishing a variable area orifice 88 therein, piston means 72 reciprocatively mounted within said body 48 and having at least one control orifice 94 therein for moving said valve means and for modulating the orifice area 88 to regulate the fluid pressure within said passage 90 and for regulating the velocity of the fluid flowing from said variable area 88 orifice independent of the quantity of flow there through.
