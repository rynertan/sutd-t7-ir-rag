# SYSTEM FOR THE ELECTRONICAL SECTOR SCANNING OF THE BEAM OF A MONOPULSE RADAR ANTENNA

## Abstract
System for the electronic sector scanning of a bundle of radar antenna monopulses, which allows scanning times in the order of Âµs by the separation of the R.F. power at a pre determined phase and whith amplitude control.
