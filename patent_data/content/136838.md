# Rotary drill chuck.

## Abstract
Each of three jaws 15 of a rotary rock drilling chuck is carried by the stem 14 of a piston 13 acting in a cylinder 12 against belleville springs between it and an end cap 18 . Hydraulic pressure can be applied to the opposite end of each piston to overcome the spring pressure and release the chuck. Three pairs of counterweights 20 are equally and circumferentially spaced abut the clamping axis and act through levers 21 pivoted to the chuck body at 22 so as to apply force to the respective pistons and thus to counteract centrifugal force acting on each piston.
