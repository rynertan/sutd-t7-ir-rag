# Joint structure for a structural bar assembly.

## Abstract
A first bar 1 and a tubular second bar 2 are assembled by inserting or fitting a portion 4 of a web 2 of the first bar 1 into a transverse slot 7 of the second bar 6 , and by restoring a stop plate 5 of the web portion 4 elastically or forcibly to an upwardly inclined state so as to allow a top end 5b of the stop plate 5 to engage or contact with an inner surface of a front wall 6c of the second bar 6 after the stop plate has passed through the slot. Joint portions of the first bar and the second bar are not pressed or struck strongly. There is little fear of rusting or erosion in the joint portions owing to damage to plating or paint layers.
