## Description
This invention relates generally to artificial respiratory devices and to compositions for use in methods, more particularly in chemical methods for providing whole body oxygenation of a mammal whose respiratory system is partially or completely inoperative. More particularly, the present invention relates to compositions for use in methods and devices for treating mammals suffering from anoxia. This application is related to U.S. Patent No. 4,445,500, U.S. Patent 4,445,886 and U.S. Patent 4,378,797. The present application is also related to the following issued United States patents, U.S. Patent 4,445,514 U.S. Patent 4,393,863 U.S. Patent No. 4,450,841 U.S. Patent No. 4,445,887 U.S. Patent No. 4,446,154 U.S. Patent 4,446,155 U.S. Patent 4,451,251 U.S. Patent 4,445,888 and U.S. Patent 4,445,500. There are many post traumatic and post operative patients who develop major pulmonary complications which interfere with or preclude adequate oxygenation. The shock lung best characterizes this syndrome complex. Severe pneumonias, smoke inhalation, acute respiratory obstructions, pre mature birth, and birth related pulmonary injury also can lead to the same general problems with oxygenation. Patients with massive pulmonary embolism and hemothorax also suffer from severe hypoxemia. Combining patients in these categories, there is a substantial population of patients at high risk, but whose conditions are potentially reversible, given adequate oxygenation. The present invention utilizes an oxygenated fluorocarbon liquid for general body oxygenation, which is applied as a circulation through the peritoneal cavity. The aforementioned patents and patent applications reference in detail various prior art publications relating to fluorocarbons and their medical uses. More recently, in the See also U.S. Patent No. 4,402,984 Moore . The present invention provides the use of an oxygenated perfluorocarbon for preparing a medicament useful in a novel method of whole body oxygenation of the tissue of a living mammal comprising the steps of providing an oxygenated fluorocarbon containing liquid injecting said oxygenated fluorocarbon liquid into the peritoneal cavity of said mammal and withdrawing said fluorocarbon liquid from said cavity, said injecting and withdrawing being conducted at a rate sufficient to oxygenate at least a portion of the tissue of said mammal. According to the invention the oxygenated perfluorocarbon has a partial pressure of CO₂ in excess of 2.6 kPa 20 Torr . In accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention, an oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion having an aqueous component, a fluorocarbon component, and an emulsification component is utilized which is oxygenated to a pO₂ in excess of 66 kPa 500 mmH These and other objects of the invention will become apparent from the following more detailed description. The present invention is useful in a novel method for oxygenating the tissue of a living mammal employing an oxygenated fluorocarbon containing liquid. The preferred fluorocarbon containing liquid is the oxygenated fluorocarbon nutrient emulsion which is disclosed in my aforementioned United States patents, such as U.S. Patent 4,445,886, Although this fluorocarbon containing emulsion is presently preferred, it is anticipated that certain constituents presently contained in this emulsion may be eliminated from the fluorocarbon containing liquid used in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention. For example, to minimize the likelihood of bacterial growth, glucose may be eliminated from the fluorocarbon emulsion formulation. Similarly, the subject amino acids and steroids in the subject composition may be eliminated, if desired. Although not presently preferred, it is within the scope of the said method to inject a liquid consisting essentially of the oxygenated fluorocarbon itself. In this treatment modality, it will be preferred to follow this fluorocarbon treatment with a lavage intended to wash remaining fluorocarbon from the peritoneum at the conclusion of treatment. This lavage may comprise injecting isotonic saline with or without a detergent or emulsifier, such as the pluronic disclosed in the aforementioned patent, to thereby reduce the likelihood of long term toxicity. Under most circumstances, it will be preferred that either or both of the subject perfusate and the subsequent lavage contain an antibiotic, such as bactracin, to minimize the incidence of peritoneal infection In accordance with the present invention, it is desired to provide carbon dioxide and oxygen to the subject emulsion in a pump type oxygenator such as a Harvey Pediatric Oxygenator, to obtain po₂ values in excess of 66, kPa 500 mmHg , preferably 73 86 kPa 550 650 mmHg . In order to ensure that substantial oxygen transfer will occur, it is presently preferred to oxygenate the subject fluorocarbon containing liquid to a pO₂ in excess of 66 kPa 500 mmHg prior to injection. As reported in the aforementioned patents, these oxygen tensions are easily obtainable with the subject oxygenated fluorocarbon emulsion. The preferred fluorocarbon emulsion, as described in U.S. Patent 4,445,886, comprises a perfluorobutyl tetrahydrofuran, an emulsifier such as a pluronic, electrolytes, and various components such as glucose, amino acids, ions, hormones, vitamins, etc. The emulsion is oxygenatable to pO₂ values of about 86 kPa 650 mmHg using a pump oxygenator and about 52.8 kPa 400 mmHg with simply bubble oxygenation. Frequently the emulsion will also be treated with carbon dioxide to give pCO₂ values in the range 2.6 4 kPa 20 30 mmHg . The milliosmolarity of the subject emulsion is typically physiologic, normally having an mOsM L of about 298 317, or about 310. In accordance wtih the present invention, it is desired to provide carbon dioxide and oxygen to the subject emulsion in a pump type oxygenator such as a Harvey Pediatric Oxygenator, to obtain pO₂ values in excess of 66 kPa 500 mmHg , preferably 73 86 kPa 550 650 mmHg . The present invention is illustrated by the following examples Accordingly, the present invention has been demonstrated as being useful in treating systemic anoxia under conditions where the subject mammals respiratory system is not capable of providing normal arterial pO₂ tensions.
