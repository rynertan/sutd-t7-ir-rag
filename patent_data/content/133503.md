# Color photographic light sensitive material.

## Abstract
A silver halide color photographic light sensitive mate rial is described, comprising a support having coated thereon at least one silver halide emulsion layer, the color photographic light sensitive material having a photographic layer containing at least one kind of magenta coupler of 5 pyrazolone type having an arylthio group at the coupling position thereof, the arylthio group having an alkoxy group or an aryloxy group at the ortho position to the sulfur atom thereof and the alkoxy group and the aryloxy group being substituted with a cyano group, a halogen atom, a sulfonyl group, a sulfinyl group, a phosphonyl group, or an A B group, wherein A represents a chemical bond, an alkylene group, an arylene group, an oxygen atom, a sulfur atom, or an imino group and B represents a hydroxy group, an alkoxy group, an aryloxy group, a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an aryl group, a heterocyclic group, an acyclic amino group, or a hydrazino group. The silver halide color photographic light sensitive material containing the 2 equivalent magenta coupler has an excellent color forming property even when it is processed in a color developing solution containing a salt of alkaline earth metal, exhibits photographic properties which are not influ enced by variations in the pH of the color developing solution, and provides a magenta color image having a good light fastness. A method of forming a color image using the silver halide color photographic light sensitive material is also described.
