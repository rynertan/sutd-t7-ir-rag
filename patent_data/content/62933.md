## Description
The present invention generally relates to the pressurized aeriform substance piston motors, and, more specifically to a motor or the mentioned type which has been improved rrom the operative point of view. The known pressurized air piston motors comprise at least a cylinder piston assembly of two stroke operation and provided witlpressurized air inlet and outlet valves. The piston is coupled to the crankshaft by means of a conventional connecting rod crank mechanism.As these motors are operated by bottle pressurized air, it is necessary to provide the bottles with pressure reducing means in order to bring the supply pressure to the desired value. A motor or the above type is also known comprising an least to blade air motors coupled to the driveshart,said air motors acting as cascade coupled pressure reducing means effective to simul taneously provide kinetic energy. The volume included between the cylinder head and the piston upper dead point is greater than that or the two blade air motors, and the volumes of the three motors are rsted in such a way as to provide three consecutive pressure reductions.More specifically, the volumes of the three motors are designed in such a way as to provide a volumetric air passage for each revolution of the crankshart, said passage being equal ror all od the three motors. While these motors operate in a satisractory way, ,on the other hand,present the drawback that they operate at predetermined pressures ana that it is necessary to periodically aajust the pressurized air supply pressure, as the latter dhanges in the bottle,hich tends to decrease depending on the consumed pressurized air. Accordingly, the task or the present invention is to eliminate the thereinabove mentioned drawbacks, by providing such a piston motor effective to use either pressurized air or steam and to operate as far as the pressurized fluid source is completely exhaust ed,without the necessity or carrying out periodic adjustings or the motor supply pressure. According to one aspect of the present invention this task is achieved by a piston motor characterized in that it comprises an inlet chamber located in the cylinder head and having a variable volume,means for varying said volume depending on the pressurized air source pressure,an inlet needle valve communicating to said inlet chamber base portion ror supplying pressurized air thereto, and a discharging valve ror discharging the expanded air. Advantageously the variable volume inlet chamber consists of a small cylinder therein a plunger Tightly slides which is oppositely located with respect to the motor piston, the latter being movable in a tight way in an expansion chamber, said plunger separating the small cylinder into two opposite chambers, one thereof forms said inlet chamber. Preferably the means ror varying the inlet chamber volume consist or mechanical means,operat ed by the same system pressure. As a variation, said means may be or hydraulic or pneumatic type, in which case the small cylinder chamber opposite to the inlet chamber rooms the driving chamber ror the plunger movable in said small cylinder, in order to vary the volume or said chamber in an inversely proportional relationship with respect to the supply pressure. In this inanner,with a hig motor supply pressure, a minimum volume or the inlet chamber is obtained which increases as the supply pressure decreases, thereby said chamber acts as a calibrating means ror the volumetric flow rate to the motor cylinder. The present invention will be described in a more detailed way thereinafter, with reference to the accompanying drawing the sole figure thereof schematically illustrates, by partially cross section and plan views, the pressurized air motor according to the invention. As it is shown in fig.l, the pressurized air motor comprises a cylinder 1 therein a piston 2 is able or sliding, said piston being provided with piston rings 3 and defining an expansion chamber in said cylinder. More specifically the cylinder 1 has a head 4 provided with a discharging outlet 6 therein the discharging valve d is loc3ted,the inlet of the air being controlled by a needle valve 7. The discharging and needle malve ,6 anu 7 respectively,are operatea, through. tappets 9 and rocking levers 10, by cam members ll,coupled to the driveshart 12.Thus the cylinder piston assembly has a two stroke type of operation.The piston 2 is coupled to the driveshaft 12 by means or the connecting rod 13 and crank 14, by the gooseneck or said driveshart 12. The needle valve 7 is coupled, through a pipe 5,to a tank, acting as a pressure equalizer for the piston 21wich latter operates by impulses, or it is directly coupled to a pressurized air bottle 30,as it is Shown in the drawing. In the motor head 4 there is provided an inlet chamber ,in the form of a small cylinder, therein a plunger 19 slides, dividing said small cylinder into two chambers, that is inlet chamber 22 and an opposite chamber 23.1he plunger 19 is provided with a resilient plunger ring, for a tight, engagement in said inlet chamber defining small cylinder 15. The needle valve 7 is operated by the tappet 9 through the rocking lever 10. The nozzle of said needle valve is so located as to communicate to the base portion of the inlet chamber 22,in the space between the piston 2 and plunger 19. The pressurized air bottle 30 tor the pressure equalizing tank is also provided with a small cylinder 16 therein a plunger 17 slides, the latter being also provide a with a sealing plunger ring ana being normally held at the lower position thereof by means or a biassing spring 20,calibrated in a proportional way to the pressure in the bottle 30. Also in this case the plunger 17 separates the small cylinder 16 into two chambers 24 and 25, said chamber 24 communicating with said pressurized air bottle 30. The two plungers 19 and 17 in the small cylinders 15 and respectively 16 are positively coupled to one another, thereby as the plunger 17 is at the upper position thereof, in which it is held by the pressure in the bottle 30,the plunger 19 is in the lower position thereor, the inlet chamber volume being thus minimum. The upper chamber 25 of the small cylinder 16 is coupled to the upper chamber 23 of the small cylinder 15 zilch is applied in the head 4 by means or 8 duct l, the two mentioned chambers and said duct lea being filled with oil thereby the rising or the plunger 17 causes a corresponding lowering of the plunger 19. Supposed that a pressure of 200 atms is present in the bottle 30, then that same pressure will be also present in the chamber 24 or the small cylinder 16 applied to the bottle 30,and it will push the plunger 17 upwardly, against the biassing of the spring 20 which latter will be calibrated for the value of 200 atms. Accordingly the oil contained in the upper chamber 25 of the small cylinder 16 will cause the plunger 19 Of the small cylinder 15 to be displaced to the lower position thereof, in such a way as to define a minimum volume inlet chamber. At this time the needle valve 7 will be opened,ich will communicate said 200 atm pressure to this minimum volume, tnereby causing the motor piston 2 to lower.Ae the piston 2 is rised again, the discharging walveduill be opened ana the air expanded during the active stroke of the piston will be dischargea to the outside. As the pressure in the bottle 30 decreases due to the pressurized air consume,Rhe plunger 17 or said small cylinder 16 will be lowered with a consequent raising or the plunger 19 in the small cylinder 15, thereby the volume of the inlet chamber 22 will increase depending on the movement of the plunger 17.Thus,as the needle valve t is opened 8 greater air volume,at a smaller pressure, will pass to the inlet chtmber,ihich will act again on the piston 2 in such a way as to cause the latter to lower again, the cycle being repeated as rar as the pressurized air in the bottle has been completely consumed. Thus, by the thereinabove illustrated system, it is possible to omit the pressure reducing assembly which is conventionally providea on the bottle, since the pressure reducing operation is carried out by the system itselI in this way the motor can be operated directly by the bottle pressurized air, at the desired pressure. Another important aspect or the present invention consists or the fact that the motor is supplied with pressurized substances, in particular steam, which affords the possibility o obtaining from the steam mechanical or electric power. Moreover the heat remaining in the motor may be used for heating spaces or supplying steam heated apparatus or systems.2hus,ouing to its particular construction, the instant motor is effective to recover thermal power and operate with aeriform substances at a pressure from 5 to 200 atoms. Obviously the positive displacement of the two plungers 19 ana 17 can be also obtained in any ways known to those skilled in the art. While the present invention has been disclosed and illustrated with reference to a single embodiment thereof, it should be noted that it Is ausceptible to all modifications and variations falling within the scope or the inventive idea.
