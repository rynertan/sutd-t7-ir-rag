## Description
This invention relates to a manually operated dual compartmented container having the means to intermix the contents of the two compartments from outside the container. More particularly this invention relates to an additive container which is made a part of a flexible container holding a standard diluent such as normal saline solution, dextrose or water. In this manner a pre determined amount of medicament either in powdered or liquid form may be added to a diluent by activation of the additive transfer device and the resulting solution administered intravenously to a patient. Devices providing separate compartments in a single container for separately enclosing different components in such a way that they may be later intermixed are described in U.S. Patent 2,176,923 to Nitardy, U.S. Patent 3,290,017 to Davies et al. and U.S. Patent 3,532,254 to Burke et al. These devices are deficient in not being able to maintain an effective seal between the two components to be intermixed. Additionally the barrier between the chambers does not adequately withstand the rigors of handling and shipping leading to premature removal or leakage of moisture into the dry medicament. For containers used in health care situations, sterility must be maintained. While simple in configuration the arrangement of parts in the devices found in the prior art makes them difficult to sterilize unless the entire device is assembled in a totally sterile environment. Such manufacture is exceedingly expensive. Also known from FR A 1,180,102 is a container as defined in the precharacterizing part of claim 1. Nowhere in the prior art is there available a dual compartmented container for storing and transferring a medicament from a vial to a solution container wherein a medicament vial is assembled and formed originally as part of the edge of a flexible container or later received and secured therethrough. Nor does the prior art provide an additive container transfer mechanism within a dual compartmented container that provides the opportunity for multiple moisture barrier seals in the same container for leak free separation of the medicament and the diluent before mixing. The prior art is specifically directed to single plug type devices for temporarily sealing the contents of one compartment from the other compartment in a single container system. The use of a stopper and vial combination in conjunction with a cover or stopper removal means and sleeve provides multiple opportunities for establishing multiple fluid tight or moisture barrier seals between the two compartments. It is therefore an advantage of the present invention to afford a manually operated dual compartmented container not subject to the aforementioned and the other disadvantages of the prior art. It is another advantage of the present invention to provide a manually operable dual compartmented container that is substantially chemically inert, lightweight and exceedingly compact. It is still another advantage of the present invention to provide a manually operable dual compartmented container that will afford rapid intermixing of the contents of the two containers. Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent as the description proceeds. The foregoing advantages are accomplished and the shortcomings of the prior art are overcome by the container defined in claim 1. According to another aspect of the invention, the foregoing advantages are accomplished and the shortcomings of the prior art are overcome by a method as defined in claim 20. The present manually operated dual compartmented container wherein the wall means either in the form of an edge portion or a tubular port of a flexible outer container provides a means for securing a stoppered container vial with stopper removal means positioned in the inside of the outer container. The fluid contents of the vial and the flexible container may be mixed by manipulation from the exterior of the flexible bag which effects removal of the stopper by means of the stopper removal means from the vial inside the outer container. Accordingly, fluid communication is provided between the two compartments for mixing of the fluid contents of the compartments. A better understanding of the manually operated dual compartmented container will be had by reference to the drawings wherein Proceeding to a detailed description of one embodiment of the invention, the manually operated, dual compartmented container generally 20 is shown in FIGURES 1 4. It is adapted to be used with a flexible container 22 formed from two opposing sheets of flexible material that have been joined and sealed at the edges 21. Container 22 is constructed to provide a fluid tight compartment 25 for diluent 82 between opposing side walls such as 29 and 31. Sealed through an opening 86 in the sealed edges 21 of the flexible container by means of mandrel seal 16 is a sleeve 24 which has a portion 26 within the compartment 25 of the flexible container and portion 28 outside the edges 21 of the flexible container 22. It will be appreciated that as the flexible container is formed from two opposing sheets of plastic material, sleeve 24 will in effect be placed between the opposing edges such as shown at 86. Disposed within the sleeve in a tight fitting manner is a glass vial 30 containing medicament 84 which is shown in powdered form but may also be a liquid. Positioning the vial 30 within sleeve 24 is inwardly facing annular ridge 88 which contacts an angled wall portion 90 of vial 30. The vial 30 is sealed with a stopper 32 which has a reduced portion 34, fitting within the neck 58 of the vial 30 and an expanded portion 36 which extends from the neck 58 of the vial 30. On the expanded portion 36 of the stopper 32 extending from the neck 58 of the vial 30 are external threads 38 which are compatible with internal threads 40 formed on annulus 50 which extends from cover 42. The cover 42 is thereby threadably engaged with the stopper 32 and also engaged with sleeve 24 by means of an annular lip 44 formed on the skirt portion 48. Annular lip 44 is constructed to snap over outwardly facing annular ridge 46 extending from the exterior wall 52 of the sleeve 24. A first fluid tight seal is thus formed at the contacting surfaces on the inside of the skirt 48 and the exterior of sleeve 24. A second fluid tight seal is formed on the interior wall 54 of sleeve 24 where it contacts the flat portion 56 of annulus 50 which extends from cover 42. Additional fluid tight seals are provided between vial rim or finish 62 and shoulder 60 on stopper 32 and between the throat 64 of vial 30 and the contacting edge of reduced portion 34 of stopper 32 which extends into the neck 58 of the vial 30. For ease of manufacture and to prevent distortion, cover alignment annulus 66 is placed into recess 68 formed within stopper 32. The outwardly extending portion of vial 30 may be covered by a cap structure generally 70 which includes flange 72 for sealing to flange 80 formed on the portion 28 of sleeve 24 external to flexible container 22. A hanger 75 is integrally formed as a portion of cap 70 to facilitate hanging the dual compartmented container such as when made part of a standard I.V. system not shown . Shown on the bottom of flexible container 22 is a port generally 74 which may be used to fill the flexible container 22 with liquid diluent 82 or to administer the mixture 83 of the fluid 82 and the medicament 84 contained within the vial 30. The port 74 may also include the usual diaphragm 76 and a cap 78. FIGURES 5 13 depict several embodiments wherein the same reference numbers have been employed to designate components having the same function, construction and relative location as in the embodiment of FIGURE 1. It will be appreciated that in all of the embodiments the vial or inner container is sealed with the stoppered portion within the outer container. FIGURES 5 and 5A depict a first alternative embodiment generally 120 wherein connecting the cover 42 with the sleeve 24 is a toggle means generally 188 located on either side of the sleeve 24. The toggle means 188 has a pair of arm members 190 and 192 joined by a flexible portion 194 on either side of sleeve 24. When the toggle means 188 is flexed outward as shown in FIGURE 5 the stopper 32 and cover 42 are in fluid sealed relationship with respect to vial 30 and sleeve 24. When extended or flexed inward as in FIGURE 5A the toggle means 188 allows the cover 42 and stopper 32 combination to move away from the vial 30 so as to allow passage of the medicament 84 from within vial 30 to the diluent 82 within flexible container 22. FIGURES 6 and 6A depict a second alternative embodiment generally 220 wherein connecting the cover 42 to the sleeve 24 is a strap 296. The strap 296 allows the stopper 32 and cover 42 combination to be in fluid sealed relationship with the vial 30 and sleeve 24, respectively, but allows the stopper 32 and cover 42 combination to swing away from the sleeve 24 and vial 30 as one unit when it is desired to intermix the medicament 84 in the vial 30 and the diluent 82 in the flexible container 22 as shown in FIGURE 6A. FIGURE 7 depicts a third alternative embodiment generally 320 wherein there is attached to the cover 342 a tab means 398. Tab means 398 may be gripped from outside the flexible sides such as 29 of container 22 and used to assist the user in removing the cover 342 and stopper 32 combination from the sleeve 24 and vial 30 respectively. FIGURE 8 depicts a fourth alternative embodiment generally 420 wherein the flexible container 22 includes an additional port means 402 which may be used for the insertion of a syringe cannula 404 or spike 406 to add diluent to an empty container 22, to sample the mixture after activation of the vial by removal of cover 42, or to attach to an I.V. administration set. FIGURE 9 depicts a fifth alternative embodiment generally 520 wherein a central latch means generally 508 is disposed within a recess 568 located within the central portion of stopper 532. It is used to secure the cover 542 to the stopper 532 instead of the threadable engagement 38, 40 shown in FIGURES 1, 5, 6 and 7. Recess 568 has an inward facing lip 511 around its outer edge for engagement with projection 512 of latch arm 514 from the cover 542 which extends into the recess 568 in the stopper 532. The lower portion 526 of sleeve 524 within flexible bag 22 terminates in an outwardly tapering portion 516 which matches the taper of protrusion 540 from cover 542. Flanged tapered ring 518 slides down sleeve 524 and sandwiches outwardly tapering portion 516 against protrusion 540. In this manner cover 542 is retained on sleeve 524. Strap 596 connects the flanged tapered ring 518 to the base of cover 542. Accordingly, flanged tapered ring 518 and latch means 508 act together to hold cover 542 in place on the sleeve 524 and in contact with stopper 532. FIGURE 10 depicts a sixth alternative embodiment generally 620 wherein a second additional rotatable engagement means 608 is used to secure the cover 642 not only to the rubber stopper 632 and the sleeve 24 but also to the vial 630. Annulus 650 is formed on cover 642 to include both internal screw threads 640 and an extended portion 610 which carries a projecting portion 612 of second rotatable engagement means 608. Projecting portion 612 operatively engages an internally threaded portion 614 formed in the side of the outwardly extending annular lip 660 around the mouth or finish of vial 630. A compression ring 690 is formed on stopper 632 inwardly of external threads 638. An additional seal is formed by the force on compression ring 690 from annular shoulder 680 of cover 642 directed toward vial finish 662. FIGURE 11 depicts a seventh alternative embodiment generally 720 wherein additional detachable sealing means generally 708 are used to secure the cover 742 not only to the rubber stopper 732 and the sleeve 24 but also to the vial 30. Annulus 750 is formed in cover 742 to include both internal screw threads 740 and an extended latch portion 710. Extended latch portion 710 carries a projection 712 which engages the underside of the outwardly extending annular lip 760 around the mouth of the vial 30 in a snap fit manner. A compression ring 790 is formed on stopper 732 inwardly of external threads 738. An additional fluid tight seal is formed by the force on compression ring 790 from shoulder 780 directed toward finish 762. FIGURE 12 depicts an eighth alternative embodiment generally 820 wherein flange means 846 is formed on the bottom portion of sleeve 824 which extends into flexible container 22. Cover 842 is attached to stopper 32 as illustrated in FIGURE 1 but is secured to sleeve 824 by a weak weld such as indicated at 850 where flange portion 843 of cover 842 meets flange means 846. Tab means 898 is used to peel cover 842 from sleeve 824 on activation of the device. FIGURE 13 depicts a ninth alternative embodiment generally 920 wherein a closed end vial receiving casing generally 923 is sealed within the edge 21 of flexible container 22. Hanger means 975 is attached to the end 925 of vial receiving casing 923. A double wall portion 927 provides a space for an internal mandrel support surface to facilitate RE welding of bag 22 to vial receiving casing 923. FIGURES 14 25 illustrate alternative embodiments of this invention wherein the additive vial such as 30 will be filled and packaged separately from flexible container 22. Accordingly, rather than being sealed through the container wall by means of a sleeve 24 it will instead be secured through the wall means by reception in and interconnection in a port 14. This interconnection would be effected, for example, in a hospital pharmacy. In describing embodiments 10, 110, 210, 310, 410 and 510, the same components will be referred to by the same numbers as previously described. Referring to FIGURE 14, it will be seen that embodiment generally 10 includes a vial 11 having the usual neck portion 12 with threads 13 extending therefrom. Complementary threads 15 extend internally from port 14 which is mandrel sealed at 16 to flexible container 22. A gasket 18 which is substantially J shaped in cross section has a leg portion 33 for seating on transverse shoulder 31 of port 14 and for sealing with vial finish 51. Gasket 18 is further secured in port 14 through recess 19 in gasket 18 for positioning over annular flange 17. Annular or ring portions 27 extend from gasket 18 for sealable engagement with cover 55 and particularly annular wall 67. Cover 55 includes a latch portion 69 for frictional engagement and seating on shoulder 73 of port 14 which is effected by contact with lip 71 of latch portion 69. Vial 11 is further sealed from diluent 82 with stopper 41 which has a small diameter section 47 and a larger diameter section 45. Each section has annular portions or rings 39 for sealable engagement with the inside of vial 11 such as with vial neck 49 and the vial finish section 53. Stopper 41 has a recess 61 with a flange 65. Recess 61 is designed to receive projection 59 having a lip 63 for engagement with flange 65 and a connecting portion 57 for cover 55. Cover 55 also includes a transverse wall 95 for interconnection with annular wall 67. FIGURES 15, 16 and 17 illustrate another embodiment generally 110 wherein, as will be seen in FIGURE 15, when the vial 30 is packaged separately from container 22, a sleeve 124 surrounds vial 30 except for the stopper portion 141. A cover cap 101 closes the sleeve which also includes flange 80. Similarly, a cover cap 102 will be positioned over port 114 from which also extends a hanger 175. Referring particularly to FIGURE 17, port 114 has an internally extending flange 115 over which is positioned annular ridge 146 on sleeve 124. It should be pointed out that previously annular ridge 146 would have supported cover cap 101. In this position in port 114, sleeve flange 80 will contact port flange 179. A gasket 118 is positioned inside port 114 and includes a shoulder 193 for resting against shoulder 131 of port 114. A flange 117 extends from gasket 118 for sealable engagement with port 114. An annular recess 191 is provided in gasket 118 to receive rim 62 of vial 30 as well as to provide a seal with finish 51. Further sealing of the contents of vial 30 from diluent 82 is effected by stopper 141 with annular rings 39 which will seal the inside of vial neck 58. Additional fluid tight sealing is afforded by a lip 185 extending from stopper 141 to also engage finish 51. Oppositely positioned is a flange 65 extending into compartment or recess 61 for contact with lip 63 extending from connecting portion 57. As the remaining portion of cover 55 with connecting portion 57 is the same as described in conjunction with embodiment 10, its description need not be repeated. Referring to FIGURE 18, an interconnection and sealing of the medicament 84 in vial 30 from diluent 82 in container 22 is different in this embodiment than in embodiments 10 and 110. In this embodiment 210, the rim 62 of vial 30 will be positioned and sealed in port 214 by means of recess 297 in gasket 218. Gasket 218 will be retained in port 214 by providing a recess 201 as well as a recess 298 in gasket 218 for reception of flange 219 extending from port 214. It will be seen that stopper 141 is substantially the same as previously described in embodiment 110 as well as the engagement with cover 55 and connecting portion 57 except that it includes a lip 185 for engagement with container lip 62. Accordingly, these same components and elements are referred to by the same numbers. Embodiment generally 310 in FIGURES 19, 20 and 21 depict vial unit 30 which when filled with medicament 84 can be directly heat sealed to port structure 314. In this embodiment, a stopper 341 closes neck 58 and has a compartment 361 for receiving projection 359 of connecting portion 357. A flange 365 extends from stopper 341 for engagement with projection 359 and has a transverse wall 395 for contact with a complementary wall section on stopper 341. Extending over container lip 62 is an annulus 300 having a recess 301 for partial fitment thereover. Container port 314 will have sealed thereto such as at 323 an overwrap 302 which will extend over flexible container 22. A gasket 304 will be accommodated in recess 305 in port 314 for the purpose of making an adequate seal between container 22 and port 314. Gasket 304 is sealed at 324 to container 22 such as with R.F. welding but is friction sealed to port 314. A cover generally 342 has a compartment 306 with a gasket 307 to surround port 314. A latch portion 369 is provided on cover 342 for removable attachment to port 314 by means of lip 371 engaging shoulder 373 on port 314. Cover 342 also includes an annular wall 367 terminating in end wall 308 for sealing to insert 358 as will be later explained in the Operation. At the opposite end of port 314, a flange 379 extends laterally therefrom. As seen in FIGURE 21, overwrap 302 will be weld sealed at 381 and will surround port 314. The usual tear portion 309 is provided for removal of the overwrap. Embodiments 410 and 510 which are illustrated in FIGURES 22A, 22B and 23 25 depict embodiments which utilize a latching collar such as 400 and 500 for securing container ports 414 and 515 respectively to container lip or rim 62. Referring specifically to embodiment 410, it will be seen that it includes a multi component receiving and sealing system in that a ferrule 403 is positioned over finish 62 and will contact and retain shroud tube 418 against rim portion 62. Shroud tube 418 contacts finish 51 on container 30 and extends downwardly to seal against gasket 407 having recess 411 to receive extension 412 of shroud tube 418. Port 414 also includes a flange 409 for seating in slot 408 of gasket 407. Annular portions 439 extend from gasket 407 to seal against annular wall 67 of cover 55. Cover 55 with its associated connecting portion 57 for engagement with stopper 141 is the same as described in conjunction with embodiment 10 as indicated by the same reference numerals. This is also true with respect to the hereinafter described embodiment 510. Embodiment 510 represents still another means of sealing a container vial 30 into a port structure 515. In this particular embodiment, port 515 has a leg portion 531 interconnecting with a T shaped head portion 517. Positioned within this configuration is gasket 519 having a slot 509 to receive head portion 517 as well as an extension 521 to partially surround a portion of head portion 517. Sealing rings 539 extend from gasket 519 to engage annular wall 67 of cover 55. Collar 500 has a recess 501 to surround flange 579 as well as to contact the upper portion of lip 62. FIGURES 23 25 specifically show the collar 500 and its latching relationship with respect to vial 30. Collar 500 has a recess 501 surrounded by arcuate walls 502 and 503 which are connected by hinge portion 504. Extending from one end of the collar 500 is a latch member 506 with a barb portion 507 for placement through opening 513 and retention with wall 522 see FIGURE 24 . A hanger portion 575 extends from collar 500 to support the interconnected vial 30 and container 22 as specifically shown in FIGURE 25. It should be pointed out that collar 400 is of a similar construction to collar 500 and surrounds rim 62 of vial 410 and flange 479 in a similar manner as described for embodiment 510. A better understanding of the advantages of the manually operated dual compartmented containers of this invention will be had by a description of their operation. The operation of the containers 20, 120, 220, 320, 420, 520, 620, 720, 820 and 920 will be described first. Dual compartmented container 20 generally will be received by health care personnel as shown in FIGURE 1. Activation of the dual compartmented container 20 is begun as shown in FIGURE 2. The cap 70 is grasped by the thumb and the forefinger, and used to push cover 42 into the central portion of flexible container 22. Although not essential to operability of the dual compartmented container 20 disclosed herein, forming the flexible bag 22 so that the top shoulders 23 are shaped in an arcuate manner and the longitudinal seams 21 on either side of sleeve 24 taper inward reduces the amount of manual force necessary to urge the sleeve 24 into the inner compartment 25 of flexible container 22. Once the cover 42 has been pushed into the central portion of the flexible container 22 the cover 42 is grasped from outside the flexible sides such as 29 of the container 22 as by pressing the adjacent portions of the walls 29 and 31 thereagainst see FIGURE 1B . Adding a flange 43 to the cover 42 facilitates this operation. By holding the cap 70 and manipulating cover 42 and stopper 32 combination from the outside the flexible container 22 the stopper 32 and cover 42 combination may be removed from the vial 30 as shown in FIGURE 3. This will cause the medicament 84 to fall from within the vial 30 into the diluent 82 in compartment 25 of the flexible container 22. The exterior walls of the flexible container 22 may be further manipulated to assure complete mixing of the medicament 84 such as any one of a variety of powdered or liquid pharmaceutical products such as the following antibiotics cephalothin, oxacillin, nafacillin, ampicillan, ticarcillin, carbenicillin, erythromycin, nitroprusside and succinylcholine, vitamin or nutritional preparations and a diluent 82 such as water or dextrose or saline solution to form mixture 83. Once mixed the visual indication of the stopper 32 and cover 42 combination in the mixture 83 as shown in FIGURE 4 will indicate that the dual compartmented container has been activated. Hanger 75 may be used to attach the dual compartmented container 20 to a hook from an I.V. pole 77. The embodiments shown in FIGURES 5 7 and 9 13 are operated in a similar manner to that described in FIGURES 1 4 except as more specifically described below. Referring specifically to the embodiment shown in FIGURES 5 and 5A toggle means 188 is contacted by pressing the walls 29 and 31 of flexible container 22 thereagainst. Toggle means 188 is pressed inward to effect fluid communication between the two compartments. The straightening action of toggle means 188 causes the stopper 32 and cover 42 combination to be removed from the neck 58 of vial 30 thus allowing medicament 84 to pass into diluent 82 as shown in FIGURE 5A. In the FIGURE 6 embodiment the stopper 32 and cover 42 combination do not fall into mixture 83. Rather, they are retained on sleeve 24 by strap 296. The FIGURE 7 embodiment operates in a manner similar to that of FIGURE 1 except that instead of manipulating the stopper 32 and cover 342 combination through the walls 29 and 31 of flexible container 22, tab means 398 are grabbed from only one flexible side of container 22 to assist in removing the stopper 32 and cover 342 combination. In the FIGURE 8 embodiment 420, the dual compartmented container is shown without a diluent in container 22. In this condition, diluent may be added through a syringe cannula 404 or spike 406 inserted in port 74. Once the diluent has been added to container 22, the dual compartmented container activated and the medicament mixed with the diluent, spike 406 may be attached to an I.V. administration set. Alternatively a second port 402 may be used for the addition of an additive material into container 22 in the usual manner. In the FIGURE 9 embodiment 520, flanged tapered ring 510 is moved outwardly with respect to outwardly tapering portion 516 of sleeve 524. This outward movement releases the pressure on outwardly tapering portion 516 and thus reduces the force on protrusion 540 which holds cover 542 onto sleeve 524. Flanged tapered ring 518 may be moved upward and outward on sleeve 524 until strap 596 is fully extended. The disengagement of projection 512 from cover 542 on the underside of lip 511 on stopper 532 causes stopper 532 to leave the vial 530 when downward force is exerted on cover 542. The medicament 84 is then combined with diluent 82 in container 22. Referring to the embodiments shown in FIGURES 10 and 11, they have extended portions 610 and 710 respectively, effecting a better seal connection and not affecting operability. The embodiment shown in FIGURE 12 offers the advantage of tab means 898 being grabbed through one of the flexible sides such as 29 of container 22 to separate the weak weld 850 which joins cover 842 to flange 846 and removes stopper 32 from vial 30. The embodiment 920 shown in FIGURE 13 operates exactly the same as in FIGURE 1. The operation of the embodiments shown in FIGURES 14 25 will now be described. As indicated earlier, vials 11 and 30 will be supplied independently of the flexible container 22 and will be packaged in a manner indicated in FIGURE 15. Vial 30 in this instance will include stopper 141 covered by cover cap 101. When it is desired to mix the contents of vial 30 into solution container 22, the caps 101 and 102 will be removed and the adjacent portion of sleeve 124 will be inserted into port 114 with annular ridge 146 riding over flange 115 in port 114 see FIGURE 17 . At the same time, vial rim 62 will sealably engage annular recess 191 of stopper 118. Simultaneously, lip 63 of connecting portion 57 will be seated in recess 61 and adjacent flange 65. Further sealing is afforded by gasket 118 with extension 119 sealing against wall 67 of cover 55. If desired, sealing rings such as 39 could be provided on extension 119 for contact with wall 67. It will be appreciated that cover 55 as well as gasket 118 will previously be positioned in port 114 with cover 55 placed within the confines of container 22. Embodiment 11C will be activated in the manner previously described for embodiments numbered in the 20 series. This is effected by pushing vial 30 further into the body of container 22 as indicated in FIGURE 2, which positioning is accomplished by the flexing of shoulders 23. When vial 30 assumes a position as indicated in FIGURE 2, cover 55 will be grasped, preferably by the thumb and forefinger, and facilitated by flange 179. A pulling action away from vial 30 will cause latch portion 69 to disengage shoulder 73. This in turn will effect a pulling action on stopper 141 which force will be transmitted through connecting portion 57 to projecting lip 63 acting on stopper flange 65. A continuous pulling action will then cause stopper 141 to be removed from neck 58 of vial 30 to thereby permit medicament 84 to flow into diluent 82. Accordingly, cover 55 with connection portion 57 and projecting lip 63 affords a stopper removal means. It will be appreciated that embodiment 110 offers a tamper indicating system in that once the vial 30 is placed in port 114 and lip 63 enters recess 61, any attempt to remove vial 30 will effect a removal of stopper 141 and a spillage of powder 84 which is readily observed. Embodiment 110 also offers the versatility of being preassembled. This could be effected by sealing sleeve flange 80 to port flange 179. The interconnection of vial 11 into port 14 in embodiment 10 will be substantially the same as previously described for embodiment 110, the difference being that instead of a flange type fitment of a sleeve and container finish into a port, there is instead a screw thread action provided by the interthreading of screw threads 13 and 15. The screw action will continue until vial finish 51 will come to rest on gasket 18. At the same time, projection 59 will be positioned in recess 61 so that stopper 41 can be removed in the manner previously described in connection with embodiment 110 by removal of cover 55 from port 14. Referring to embodiment 210, a major distinction in its operation is in the securing of vial 30 inside port 214. There it will be seen that vial 30 will be placed with its associated stopper 141 into port 214 by seating vial rim 62 in recess 297 of gasket 218. With the vial properly seated, retainer plug 270 will be placed over the end of container 30 to secure it therein. It will be noted that retainer plug 270 includes a shoulder portion 200 for engagement over a portion of flange 280, which shoulder is in effect formed in part by flange 287. Retainer plug will also be aided in its engagement with port 214 by means of undercut 273 engaging port 214. In the instance where a shorter vial is employed, a larger or deeper plug 271 can be employed which will be retained in port 214 in the same manner as described for plug 270. As in the previous embodiments, with the placement of vial 30 in port 214, connecting portion 57 with lip 63 will engage flange 65 of stopper 141. Activation of this particular container system 210 will be as indicated in the previous embodiments 110 and 10. Referring to embodiment 310, it is different from the previous ones in that container 30 will be integrally connected to port 314 and will be done so at the time of fabrication. This will be effected by the use of hot plate or bar 303 which will, as indicated in FIGURE 19, contact adjacent portions of annulus 300 and flange 379 as well as end wall 308 with insert 358. When in a heated state, the heated thermoplastic surfaces will then be pressed together to result in a container system as depicted in FIGURE 20. This heating procedure offers the advantage of presenting sterile adjacent surfaces of flange 379 to annulus 300 and adjacent surfaces of end wall 308 to insert 358. To activate this container system, cover 342 will be unlatched from port 314 by removal of lip 371 from port 314 which will effect a pulling action and removal of stopper 341 due to the fusion of end wall 308 with transverse wall 395 forming a connecting portion 357. The operation of embodiments 410 and 510 are different from those previously described in the use of latching collars 400 and 500, which will maintain container 30 in connection with respective ports 414 and 515 once the vial is placed into the port with rim 62 placed in seating engagement with shroud tube 418 and gaskets 519, respectively. As will be seen in FIGURES 22A, 22B and 25, collars 400 and 500 will capture flanges 479 and 579 respectively, in a recess such as 501 with upper arcuate walls 402 and 502 contacting ferrule 403 on lip 62 in embodiment 410 or directly on lip 62 in the instance of embodiment 510. After the latching action of the respective collars 400 and 500, the activation of both of these container systems 410 and 510 will be as previously described with the removal of covers 55 and the pulling action effected on stopper 141 by means of connecting portion 57. While several means exist for manufacture and assembly of the dual compartmented container it is preferable to begin by forming the flexible container from two sheets of flexible material in order to form side walls 29 and 31. An opening 86 is left at the top of the container for sleeve 24 or ports 14, 114, 414 and 515, and at the bottom of the container for port 74. Covers 42, 55, 342, sleeve 24 and the ports are assembled under sterile conditions and RF mandrel sealed or heat sealed through the edge of the flexible container 22. Similarly, port 74 is RF sealed or heat sealed into the flexible container 22. The flexible container 22 may then be sterile filled with diluent 82 through port 74. Once filled the H shaped administration port 76 and cap 78 are placed on port 74. Vial 30 is filled with medicament 84 and sealed by stopper 32 under sterile conditions. In the instance of the embodiments shown in FIGURES 1 13, once assembled, the filled and stoppered vial 30 is inserted under sterile conditions through sleeve 24 so as to operably engage stopper 32 with cover 42. Cap 70 may now be attached to sleeve 24 by RF weld or heat sealing flange 80 to flange 72. In the instance of the embodiments illustrated in FIGURES 14 22B, after the vials 30 or 11 are filled and stoppered, they will be covered with a closure cap such as 101 as will the container port such as 114 with closure cap 102. The embodiment shown in FIGURE 13 provides an alternate means of manufacture. Instead of inserting vial 30 from the top of sleeve 24 as in the other embodiments, the sealing of vial receiving casing 923 into the edge 21 of flexible container 22 permits the pre filled, sterilized and capped vial to be inserted through the flexible container 22 into vial receiving casing 923. Cover 42 is placed on stopper 32 before insertion of vial 30 through flexible container 22 into vial receiving casing 923. Vial 30 is held in place by the snap fit of lip 44 on cover 42 over ridge 946 on vial receiving casing 923 in a manner similar to that shown in FIGURE 1. It will be appreciated that in embodiments 10, 110, 210, 310, 410 and 510, interconnection between vial containers 11 and 30 and the flexible container 22 is afforded by container port engagement means provided by the flexible container ports and complementary engagement means provided by the container vials 11 and 30. The engagement means provided by the container ports is represented by threads 15 in embodiment 10 flange 115 in embodiment 110, recess 297 in gasket 218 in embodiment 210 flange 379 in embodiment 310 gasket 407 in embodiment 410 and gasket 519 in embodiment 510. The respective complementary engagement means of vial containers 11 and 30 is represented by threads 13 in embodiment 10 flange 146 in embodiment 110 annulus 300 in embodiment 310 shroud tube 418 in embodiment 410 and vial rim 62 in embodiment 510. The preferred material for manufacturing the flexible container cap 70, sleeve 24 and the port receiving vials is a translucent polyester or a polypropylene plastic material. However other resinous materials such as a polyvinyl chloride or polyethylene may be used. The preferred material for covers 42, 55 and 342 is polyethylene however, polyester or polypropylene may be used. Stoppers such as 32, 41, 141, 341 as well as gaskets such as 18, 118, 218, 418, 519 as well as 407 and 307 are fabricated from rubber, however a flexible plastic may be used such as thermoplastic resin. Vials 11 and 30 are preferably made of glass, however a rigid or semi rigid plastic such as polypropylene or polycarbonate may be substituted for glass. While the present dual compartmented container has been preferably described for use with a powdered medicament in a vial and a liquid in the bag, it is obvious that the container is usable with any fluid material. For example, a liquid could be placed in the vial for mixing with liquid in the bag. Further, while the present dual compartmented container has been described for use with fluid materials in the health care field, it will be appreciated that the dual compartmented container system can be applied to other fields. For example, it would have application with any fluid materials where it is necessary to maintain two materials in a separate condition until prior to mixing and use, and where one of the materials to be maintained is sensitive to ambient conditions. It should be understood that the term fluid material or fluid contents as employed in the specification or claims is meant to imply any medicament or diluent material which will flow from one container to another whether a liquid, solid or gas. It will thus be seen that through the present invention there is now provided a manually operable dual compartmented container which is easily manufactured and used. The container system of this invention affords a sterile environment for fluid materials of any type during storage as well as mixing, yet in a manner that provides an inexpensive system. A unique sealing arrangement is also afforded between two containers which will provide a proper moisture barrier and substantially reduce the transmission of one material into the other until intentional mixing is desired. The foregoing invention can now be practiced by those skilled in the art. Such skilled persons will know that the invention is not necessarily restricted to the particular embodiments presented herein. The scope of the invention is to be defined by the terms of the following claims as given meaning by the preceding description. Where technical features mentioned in any claim are followed by reference signs, those reference signs have been included for the sole purpose of increasing the intelligibility of the claims and accordingly such reference signs do not have any limiting effect on the scope of each element identified by way of example by such reference signs.
