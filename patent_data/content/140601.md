# A ceramic honeycomb structural body, a method of manufacturing the same, an extrusion die therefor, and a rotary regenerator type ceramic heat exchanger using such a ceramic honeycomb structural body.

## Abstract
To provide improved overall fin efficiency and high cell density, a ceramic honeycomb structural body has cells of a rectangular section in which the pitch ratio between the short side and the long side of the cells is substantially 1 3. Such a body can be made using an extrusion die 1 having rectangularly intersecting molding slits 2 corresponding to a section of the ceramic honeycomb structural body and material supply holes 3 through which the raw material is supplied to the molding slits 2 . The supply holes 3 can be in an equilateral hexagonal array. The die may have a plate 6 with holes 7 which each supply three of the supply holes 3 for the molding slits 2 .
