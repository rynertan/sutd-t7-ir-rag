# Hair curling roller.

## Abstract
A tubular member such as a cartridge which is filled with a material that, upon heating, changes its state from liquid to solid such as wax is flocked to enhance heat transfer from the tubular member to hair rolled around the tubular member. Top and bottom snap on flanged ends of low heat conducting material are connected to the tubular cartridge by a base means having a base portion and base sides. The sides include a plurality of locking means comprised of radial protrusions or a locking portion having a camming surface, a locking lip, and a locking surface, the radial protrusions or locking portions for communication with a groove in the tubular cartridge. Venting is provided in each base portion to promote heat dissipation from the flanged ends. An aperture is provided in the bottom flanged end base portion in registry with an aperture in the tubular cartridge for receiving a means for heating the roller. Crushing ribs may be provided on each base side to contact the flocked tubular cartridge to prevent axial rotation between the flanged ends and the tubular member. Alternatively, the tubular member may be a high heat conducting tubular material having convex protrusions which mate with concave indentations in the base sides. Spacing projections to space the tubular member from the base portion of the flanged ends may be alternatively employed.
