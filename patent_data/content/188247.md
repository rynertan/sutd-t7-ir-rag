## Description
The present invention provides a process for preparing azetidinones which are useful intermediates in the synthesis of β lactam antibiotics, esp. penems. In particular, the present invention relates to a straightforward process for converting penam compounds of formula II into heavy metal azetidinone mercaptides of formula I More particularly, when R₁, R₂ are halogen, they are preferably bromo. When R₁, R₂ are organic radicals, they are preferably substituted or unsubstituted C₁ C₄ alkyl groups, more preferably protected 1 hydroxyethyl group C₁ C₄ alkoxy groups such as a methoxy group, or a residue of formula NR R , wherein R and R together form a dicarboxylic acyl group or an organic ylidene residue, or R is a hydrogen atom or trimethyl silyl group and R is an N protecting group such as trityl, or R CO, wherein R is C₁ C₈ alkyl or alkenyl optionally interrupted by 0, S, CO or NH or substituted by an 0, S or N function or by halogen, cyano, heterocyclyl, hydroxy, carboxy, aryl or cycloalkyl group or R is phenyl or heterocyclyl group. When R₃ is an organic radical, it is preferably a C₁ C₄ alkyl such as methyl or tert butyl, or another organic group selected among those known to undergo mild enzymic or chemical hydrolysis when linked to a carboxylate moiety such as trichloroethyl or p nitrobenzyl group when M is a heavy metal M₁ in the 1 oxidation level, it is preferably Ag A particularly preferred substituted alkyl group that R₁ or R₂ may represent is 1 hydroxyethyl, wherein the hydroxyl is preferably protected as a silyl ether, e.g. 1 tert butyldimethylsilyloxyethyl, or as a carbonate, e.g. 1 trichloroethoxycarbonyloxyethyl. Still preferably, R₂ represents such 1 hydroxyethyl groups and R₁ is hydrogen, or R₁ is hydroxyethyl and R₂ is bromo. Particularly preferred R₃ groups are methyl, trichloroethyl, p nitrobenzyl, acetoxymethyl. A particularly preferred heavy metal M₁ in the 1 oxidation level is Ag A number of heavy metal salts of 4 mercaptoazetidinones are already known in the literature R. Lattrell, The usefulness of the compounds of formula II as intermediates in the field of β lactam antibiotics is self evident and in part documented in the literature referred to above. In fact, these salts can be readily alkylated, acylated and converted into a number of 4 azetidinylthioderivatives, according to reaction known A straightforward synthesis of compounds of formula I was still in demand, and it is now provided by the present invention. In fact, the methods known in the art and referred to above usually exploit an azetidinyl trityl sulphide or an azetidinyl tetrahydropyranil sulphide, which has to be synthesized through a multistep sequence either by total synthesis or from natural penicillins. Instead, the present invention allows a direct conversion of penicillins into the compounds of formula I under mild, non critical conditions. Moroever, the products I need not be isolated but can be further converted According to the present invention, a solution of the starting penicillin of formula II in an aprotic organic solvent is treated with a strong, poorly nucleophilic base and an organic or inorganic salt of the heavy metal M₁, or of the M₂A aggregate, wherein M₁M₂ and A are as defined above. Preferred bases are diazabicyclononene DBN , 1,4 diazabicyclooctane DABCO and diazabicycloundecene DBU preferred solvents are acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, benzene, dichloromethane preferred heavy metal salts are silver nitrate, silver perchlorate, silver acetate, mercury II acetate, methoxycarbonylmercury II acetate and phenyl mercury II chloride. Best yields are generally obtained in the temperature range 70 C 100 C in several instances, the reaction is conveniently carried out at room temperature by which we mean 15 20 C. Protection from the light, an inert atmosphere and dry solvents are usually beneficial. If isolation of the product is desired, this can be usually performed by aqueous work up the compounds of formula I are usually extracted with standard organic solvents e.g. ethyl acetate, dichloromethane . Alternatively, the heavy metal thiolates can be conveniently acylated or alkylated in situ, more preferably acylated. Alkylation of the heavy metal mercaptides of formula I can be performed with reactive halides, such as methyl iodide, allyl bromide, benzyl bromide, and the like. Alkylation with α halo acyl derivatives of formula III The product thereby obtained is an azetidinyl thioester of formula V The importance of azetidinyl thioesters in the synthesis of penems is well known see, for example, I. Ernest in Chemistry and Biology of β Lactam Antibiotics , Morin and Gorman ed., Academic Press, NY, 1982, vol. 2, pp 315 359 several routes from penams to these intermediates have been devised but they all suffer from major drawbacks see M. Alpegiani et al., A particularly convenient procedure which for the first time elicits the synthesis of penem compounds of formula VII from penam compounds of formula II in a mere three step process is herebelow described as illustrative of the merits of the present invention In step a , the penam compound of formula II is converted into the azetidinyl thioester of formula V as above described. Conversion of the compound of formula V into a trialkoxyphosphorane of formula IV , step b , is simply accomplished by ozonolysis and quenching of the ozonide with excess trialkylphosphite P OR₇ ₃, wherein R₇ is a lower alkyl group, preferably ethyl or methyl, according to what described by E. Perrone et al., Plain heating of the intermediates of formula VI then affords the desired penem of formula VII .
