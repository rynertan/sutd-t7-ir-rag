# LIQUID ADHERENT DISINFECTANT COMPOSITIONS FOR TOPICAL APPLICATION AND METHOD OF PREPARATION

## Abstract
A liquid adherent disinfectant composition for topical application comprises an aqueous acidic suspension of previously coagulated casein containing an aliphatic sulfate detergent as the effective agent for solubilizing the casein and converting it to a mucilaginous condition. The prepara tion also preferably contains glycerin and Lactobacillus elaborated antibiotic like factors. The composition can be prepared by fermenting a nonfat dry milk culture medium with harmless lactic acid producing bacteria, such as Lacto bacillus acidophilus, until the casein coagulates, thereafter mechanically dispersing the coagulated casein and solubiliz ing it with the aliphatic sulfate detergent. The resulting disinfectant composition can be used as a teat dip for preventing mastitis in cattle, or for other topical disinfecting purposes with domestic animals. The compositions adhere to the areas to which they are applied while being readily removable by water washing.
