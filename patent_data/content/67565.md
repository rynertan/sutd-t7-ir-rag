Particularly suitable R2R3 and R11 groups include hydrogen, halogen and amino and as intermediates , acylamino and nitro, which can conveniently be converted to the corresponding amino groups. It is generally preferred that R2 when Rll is hydrogen, is in the 4 position relative to the carbonyl side chain for greater activity in the resultant compound of the formula I .

Phenyl groups in R4, R5, R6 and R7 may be substituted by one or more C 1 4 alkoxy such as ethoxy , C1 4 alkyl such as methyl , fluoro, chloro or CF3. Often R4, R5, R6 and R7 will be selected from hydrogen, C1 4 alkyl or phenyl. Most suitably R4, R5, R6 and R7 are either hydrogen or methyl.

Suitable values for n include 0, 1 and 2, preferably 1. Suitable values for m include 0 and 1, preferably 1. It is generally preferred for higher activity that the bond between the benzamide moiety and the cyclic side chain ie between the R8 substituted nitrogen atom and the ring carbon atom to which this nitrogen atom is joined in the compounds of formula I equatorial when used herein in relation to this bond,equatorial is assigned with the bicyclic drawn with a trans ring fusion, and is also referred to as ss Axial is similarly assigned and is also referred to as a . The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compound of the formula I include acid addition salts with conventional acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, sulphuric, citric, tartaric, lactic and acetic acid The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the formula I also include quaternary ammonium salts.Examples of such salts include salts with compounds such as R10 y Y wherein R10 is C1 6 alkyl, phenyl C16 alkyl or C5 7 cycloalkyl, and Y is an anion of an acid. Suitable examples of R10 include methyl, ethyl and n and iso propyl and benzyl and phenyl ethyl. Suitable examples of Y include the halides such as chloride, bromide and iodide. There is a group of compounds within formula I wherein R1 is a C1 6 alkoxy group R2 and R are the same or different and are hydrogen, 3 halogen, CF3, C1 7 alkyl, C1 7 acylamino, C1 6 alkyl S O n wherein n is O, 1 or 2 nitro, C1 6 alkoxy, hydroxy, or amino, aminocarbonyl or aminosulphonyl optionally substituted by one or two C1 6 alkyl groups or R1 and R2 taken together are methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy in which case R3 is any one of the groups given for R1 and R2 above is hydrogen or C1 4 alkyl and R4, R5, R6, R7, p, m and n are as defined in formula I From the aforesaid it will be seen that suitably the moiety of formula II EMI6.1 in a compound of the formula I will have the structure III EMI7.1 wherein R1 is C 1 6 alkoxy R12 is hydrogen or C1 4 alkanoyl and R3 is halogen. 1 Suitable and preferred values.for R1 are as hereinbefore described under formula I for R1 when C16 alkoxy Suitable values for R12 include acetyl and propionyl preferably acetyl. R3 is preferably chloro. From the aforesaid it will also be appreciated that in one suitable sub group of compounds of formula I the moiety of formula IV EMI7.2 is of the formula V EMI7.3 wherein R41 is C16 alkyl, phenyl or phenyl C14 alkyl, either of which phenyl moieties may be substituted as hereinbefore defined and R51 is hydrogen, C1 6 alkyl, phenyl or phenyl C1 4 alkyl, either of which phenyl moieties may be substituted as hereinbefore defined . R6, m, n and p are as hereinbefore defined. Suitable and preferzed values for R41and R51 are as hereinbefore described for R4 and R5 Preferably one or both of R41 and R51 are methyl. Suitable and preferred values for R6, m, n and p are as hereinbefore described in formula I . The moiety of formula V may favourably be of formula VI EMI8.1 wherein pllis 1 or 12, preferably 1 and R4 and R5 are as hereinbefore defined R51 is preferably hydrogen. Thus one favourable sub group of compounds within formula I is of formula VII EMI8.2 In formula VII , the bond indicated may be axial or equatorial. In another suitable sub group of compounds of formula I the moiety of formula IV is of formula VIII EMI9.1 wherein R52 is hydrogen, C1 6 alkyl, phenyl or phenyl C14 alkyl, either of which phenyl moieties may be substituted as hereinbefore defined and R71 is C16 alkyl, phenyl or phenyl C14 alkyl, either of which phenyl moieties may be substituted as hereinbefore defined . R6, m, n and p are as hereinbefore defined. 2 Suitable values for R5 and R71 are as hereinbefore described for R5 and R7. Very often R52 will be hydrogen. Preferably R52 is hydrogen and R71 is methyl. Suitable and preferred values for R6, m, n and p are as hereinbefore described in formula I . The moiety of formula VII may favourably be of formula IX EMI9.2 wherein R5ê, R7Ú and PÚ are as hereinbefore defined. R5ê may suitably be axial or equatorial, and is very often hydrogen. Thus another favourable sub group of compounds of formula I is of formula X EMI10.1 In formula X the bonds indicated may be axial or equatorial. It will, of course, be realised that the compounds of the formula I have chiral centres, and thus are capable of existing in a number of stereoisomeric forms.The invention extends to each of these stereoisomeric forms, and to mixtures thereof including racemates .The different stereoisomeric forms may be separated one from the other by the usual methods, or any given isomer may be obtained by stereospecific or asymmetric synthesis. The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula I , which process comprises reacting a compound of the formula XI EMI11.1 with a compound of formula XII EMI11.2 wherein Q1 is a leaving group R13 is R1 as defined or CH2 qCR14R15 Q2 wherein q is O or 1, R14 and R15 are both hydrogen or together form an oxo group and Q2 is a leaving group or Q1 and,Q2 are joined to form a bridging oxygen atom R81iS hydrogen or C 4 alkyl and the remaining variable groups are as defined in formula I .and thereafter whenR13 is CH2 qCR14R15 Q2 and R15 form an oxo group, reducing the resulting compound and optionally converting a group R21R3 or R11 in the thus formed compound to another group R2,R3 or R11 respectively. The leaving groups Q1 and Q2 are groups that are readily displaceable by a nucleophile. Examples of such groups are hydroxy, halogen such as chloro and bromo, and for Q1 and Q2 when R14and R15together with the carbon atom to which they are attached are a carbonyl goup, acyloxy such as C1 4alkanoyloxy, C1 4 alkoxycarbonyloxy activated hydrocarbwzlcxy suzh as pentachlorophenoxy. If a leaving group is hydroxy, then the reaction is preferably carried out in an inert non hydroxylic solvent, such as benzene, toluene or diethyl ether in the presence of a dehydrating catalyst, such as a carbodiimide, for example dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The reaction may be carried out at a non extreme temperature such as 10 to 100 C, for example 0 to 800C If a leaving group is a halide, then the reaction is preferably carried out at a non extreme temperature in an inert non hydroxylic solvent, such as benzene, toluene or diethyl ether. It is also preferably carried out in the presence of an acid acceptor, such as an organic base, in particular a tertiary amine, such as triethylamine, trimethylamine, pyridine or picoline, some of which can also function as the solvent. Alternatively, the acid acceptor can be inorganic, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate or potassium carbonate. If a leaving group is acyloxy, then the reaction is preferably carried in substantially the sane manner as if the leaving group were hydroxy. Suitable examples of acyloxy leaving groups include C1 4 alkynoyloxy, mesyAoxy, tosyloxy and triflate.If a leaving group is C14 alkoxycarbonyloxy, then the reaction is preferably carried out In an inert solvent, such as methylene chloride, at a non extreme temperature in the presence of an acid acceptor, such as triethylamine. If a leaving group is activated hydrocarbyloxy then the reaction is preferably carried out in an inert polar solvent, such as dimethylformamide. It is also preferred that the activated hydrocarbyloxy group is a pentachlorophenyl ester and that the reaction is carried out at ambient temperature. Preferably Q1 when R13 is R1, is halogen such as chloro. When R14 and R15 are both hydrogen, Q1 and Q2 are the same or different and preferably are halogen, mesyloxy, tosyloxy, triflate or hydroxy. Q1 may also be C 1 4 al kanoyloxy or activated hydrocarbyloxy. Conveniently, Q1 and Q2 are the same, in particular the same halogen. When R14 and R15 together from an oxo group, Q2 is preferably an activated hydrocarbyloxy group. Alternatively,Q1 and Q2 together are 0, thus forming a derivative of phtalic anhydride when q O or of homophthalic anhydride when q l . Where R 14 and R 15 15 together form an oxo group, the reduction of the carbonyl group in the thus formed compound is preferably carried out, with or without isolation of the compound, by reduction with tin hydrochloric acid at a non extreme temperature. It will be realised that in the compound of the formula I the linkage between the NR8 8 moiety and the cyclic side chain may have an a or ss orientation with respect to the ring of the bicyclic moiety to which it is attached. A mixture of a and ss isomers of the compound of the formula I may be synthesised non stereospecifically and the desired isomer separated conventionally therefrom, e.g. by chromatography or alternatively the a or ss isomer may if desired be synthesised from the corresponding a or ss form of the compound of the formula XII . Alternatively, a mixture of the a and ss isomers of the compound of the formula XII may be synthesised non stereospecifically and the desired isomer separated conventionally therefrom, e.g. by chromatography.However, in this case it is generally more convenient to react the mixture to give a mixture of a and ss isomers of the compound of the formula I and to separate these if desired as hereinbefore described. The intermediates of formula XII may be prepared by a process which depends on whether the a or ss forms is desired, or a mixture thereof. To prepare a or axial compounds of formula XII a compound of formula XIII is reduced EMI14.1 This reduction is conveniently carried out with lithium aluminium hydride under the usual conditions. Compounds of formula XIII may themselves be prepared by reaction of a compound of the formula XIV EMI15.1 to effect conversion of hydroxy to azido, with inversion of sterochemistry. This reaction may be carried out in the general manner described in A.K. Bose et. al., TetrahedronLetters 1977, 23, 1977 . For example, the reaction may be effected with triphenylphosphine, diethyl azodicarboxylate and diphenylphosphoryl azide. Compounds of the formula XIV are important intermediates, as from these compounds the ss form of compounds of the formula XIV and alpha ss mixtures thereof, may be prepared. For example, reaction of a compound of formula XIV with a base and fluorenone yields a compound of formula XV EMI15.2 The compounds of formula XV may be converted to compounds of formula XVI EMI16.1 wherein P is hydrogen or C1 4 alkyl or phenyl C14 alkyl Suitable values for Rq include methyl and benzyl with the appropriate hydroxylamine. We have found that this reaction is suitably carried out with pyridine and the appropriate hydroxylamine hydrochloride at reflux temperatures. Reduction of a compound of formula XVI wherein Pg is hydrogen with lithium aluminium hydride gives a mixture of axial and equatorial ss amines. of formula XII . In contrast, a dissolving metal reduction of a compound of formula XVI is substantially stereospecific and yields mainly the ss amines of formula XII any minor proportions of the undesired isomer prepared in this process can be separated in conventional manner . Such reductions may suitably be carried out with sodium and amyl alcohol. When R9 is C1 4 alkyl or phenyl C1 4 alkyl, reduction with diisobutyl aluminium hydride yields mainly the a axial amine of formula XII . Compounds of the formula XIV may be prepared by conventional methods. For example, compounds of formula XIV wherein n and m are both 1 may be prepared from a compound of formula XVII EMI17.1 by process which depends on the nature of R6. When R6 is hydrogen or is other than hydrogen and substitutes the carbon other than the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen, the reaction may be carried out by reduction with, for example lithium aluminium hydride. When P6 is other than hydrogen and is at the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen, the compound of formula VII wherein R6 is hydrogen is converted firstly with base, such as sodium hydroxide and secondly with a silylating agent, such as CH3 3SiCl or hexamethyldisilazane, to the silyl ether of formula XVÏII EMI17.2 which in turn is converted to the desired compound of formula XIV with a R6 metal complex, such as R6Li, and subsequent reduction, for example with sodium borohydride. The intermediates of formula .VII may themselves be prepared by treating a compound of formula XIX EMI18.1 with formic acid. Compounds of formula XIX may be prepared from a compound of formula XX EMI18.2 by i when R7 is hydrogen reduction, for example with sodium borohydride and hydrogen chloride or ii when R7 is other than hydrogen with an R7 organometallic reagent such as R7Li or R7MgX wherein X is halogen, which compounds of formula XX may themselves be prepared either by reaction of a compound of formula XXI EMI18.3 with an alkylene halide, such as 4 brombut l ene, using base or by pyrolyis of a salt of formula XXII EMI18.4 which may be prepared from the corresponding dicarboxcylic acid and primary amine. Such compounds of the formula XXII a may be prepared by the XXI XX to XIX XVII route. It will of course be appreciated that in such a reaction sequence the XX to XIX reduction will give a mixture of isomers which can be separated by conventional means . Alternatively, when m and n are both 1, the ketone XV may be prepared by the acid catalysed condensation of an amine of formula XXIII EMI19.1 or a ketal derivative thereof. The ketone XV may also be prepared by cyclisation of a compound of formula XXIV EMI20.1 wherein W and Y are either carboxylic acid ester residues of up to 12 carbon atoms or nitrile. Suitable values for W and Y when carboxylic acid esters include C1 4 alkyl esters such as ethyl esters. Conditions for this reaction are those normally used for a standard Dieckman cyclisation reaction. Compounds of formula XXIII are either known or may be prepared by standard methods such as when one of R4, 1.R4 is hydrogen by a conventional addition reaction EMI20.2 The aforesaid processes of course yield a compound of the formula XII wherein P8 is hydrogen. If a compound of formula XII wherein R8 is alkyl is desired, it may simply be prepared from the correspondingR8 is hydrogen compound by alkylation. This may be effected in any suitable manner, for example by acylation with an anhydride followed by reduction with lithium aluminium hydride. It will be appreciated that any enantiomer, or mixture of enantiomers, of the compounds of formulae XIII , XIV , VIt XVtII may be used provided it has the depicted spatial relationship between carbons a and b. The intermediates of the formula XI are known compounds, or may be prepared in analogous manner. The intermediates of formula XII , XIII and XVI are novel and thus form an aspect of the present invention. The N oxides of the compounds of formula I may be prepared in conventional manner, for example by treatment with a per acid, such as m chloroperbenzoic acid. The acid addition salts of compounds of the formula I may be prepared in entirely conventional manner by reacting a compound of the formula I in base form with the chosen acid. The quaternary ammonium salts of the compounds of the formula I may be prepared in conventional manner for such salts, such as by reaction of the chosen compound of the formula I with a compound R6Y as defined. This reaction is suitably carried out in an appropriate solvent such as acetone, methanol, ethanol, dimethylformamide, at ambient or raised temperature and pressure. The skilled man will appreciate that the choice or necessity of conversion of groups R2, R3 and or R11 to other groups Rz, R3 and or R11 will be dictated by the nature and position of substituents R1, R2 R3 and Roll. It will be apparent that compounds of the formula I containing an R2, R3 or R11 group which is convertible to another R2, R3 R11 group are useful novel intermediates.A number of such conversions is possible not only for the end compounds of formula I , but also for their intermediates as follows a an hydrogen substituent is convertible to a nitro substituent by nitration b a nitro substituent is convertible to an amino substituent by reduction c a C14 acylamino substituent is convertible to an amino substituent by deacylation d an amino substituent is convertible to a C14 acylamino substituent by acylation e a hydrogen substituent is convertible to a halogen substituent by halogenation and f a C16 alkylthio or C16 alkylsulphinyl substituent is convertible to a C1 6 alkylsulphinyl or a C1 6alkyl sulphonyl substituent respectively by oxidation.Conversions a to f , are only exemplary and are not exhaustive of the possibilities. In regard to a , nitration is carried out in accordance with known procedures. In regard to b , the reduction is carried out with a reagent suitable for reducing nitroanisole to aminoanisole. In regard to c , deacylation is carried out by treatment with a base, such as an alkali metal hydroxide. In regard to d the acylation is carried out with an acylating agent, such as the corresponding acid or acid chloride. Formylation is carried out with the free acid. In regard to e , halogenation is carried out with conventional halogenating agents. In regard to f , oxidation is carried out at below ambient temperatures in a non aqueous solvent, such as a chlorinated hydrocarbon, in the presence of an organic peracid, such as 3 chloroperbenzoic acid, or in water in the presence of a soluble strong inorganic oxidant, such as an alkali metal permanganate or in aqueous hydrogen peroxide. As hereinbefore stated, the compounds of the formula I are dopamine antagonists. The compounds of the formula I may be used in the treatment of disorders related to impaired gastro intestina motility, such as retarded gastric emptying, dyspepsia, flatulence, oesophagal reflux, peptic ulcer and emesis. The invention therefore also provides a parma ceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula I , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such compositions may be adapted for oral or parenteral administration, and as such may be in the form of tablets, capsules, oral liquid preparations, powders, granules, lozenges, reconsitutable powders, injectable and infusable solutions or suspensions and the like the compositions may also be in the form of suppositories and the like. Normally, orally administrable compositions are preferred. Tablets and capsules for oral administration may be in unit dose presentation form, and may contain conventional excipients such as binding agents, fillers, tabletting lubricants, disintegrants, and acceptable wet.ting agents and the like. The tablets maybecoated according to methods well known in normal pharmaceutical practice. Oral liquid preparations may be in the form of, for example, aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, or elixirs, or may be presented in a dry product for reconstitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid pre parations may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents, emulsifying agents, non aqueous vehicles which may include edible oils , preservatives, and if desired conventional flavouring or colouring agents, and the like. For parenteral administration, fluid unit dosage forms are prepared utilizing the compound of the formula I and a sterile vehicle. The compound, depending on the vehicle and concentration used, can be either suspended or dissolved in the vehicle. In preparing solutions the compound can be dissolved for injection and filter sterilized before filling into a suitable vial or ampoule and sealing. Advantageously, adjuvants such as a local anaesthetic, preservatives and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle.Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same manner except that the compound is suspended in the vehicle instead of being dissolved and sterilized by exposure to ethylene oxide before suspending in the sterile vehicle. Advantageously, a surfactant or wetting agent is included in the composition to facilitate uniform distribution of the compound. As is common practice, the compositions will usually be accompanied by written or printed directions for use in the medical treatment concerned. It will of course be realised that the precise dosage used in the treatment of any of the hereinbefore described disorders will depend on the actual compound such as the seriousness of the disorder being treated. The invention further provides a method of treatment of disorders related to impaired gastro intestinal motility, such as retarded gastric emptying, dyspepsia, flatulence, oesophagal reflux, peptic ulcer or emesis, in mammals, including humans, comprising the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The effective amount will depend in the usual way on a number of factors such as the nature and severity of the malady to be treated, the weight of the sufferer, and the actual compound used. However, by way of illustration, unit doses will contain 0.005 to 20 mgs, of a compound of formula I . Again by way of illustration, such unit doses will suitably be administered more than once per day, for example 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 times a day, in such a way that the total daily dose is suitably in the range 0.01 to 20 mg kg per day. Compounds of the formula I have the ability to potentiate the effect of conventional analgesics in migraine treatment when administered concurrently with the analgesic. Thus the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula I and an analgesic, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compound of the formula I and the analgesic such as aspirin or paracetamol, will be present in the composition in amounts generally similar to their usual effective dose. The composition can be a combination produce, for example a tablet or capsule containing both a compound of the formula I and an analgesic for oral administration, or a twin pack comprising the two active ingredients separately. The invention also provides a method of treatment of migraine comprising the administration to the sufferer of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The following Examples illustrate the preparation of the compounds of formula I and the followingDescriptions illustrate the preparation of intermediates In The Examples, of course indicates that the compound is a racemate. However, for the sake of convenience, the structural formula of only one enantiomer has been shown.

Pharmacoloqical DataIncrease in intraqastric pressure Intragastric pressure changes were recorded from previously starved conscious but restrained rats using a saline filled catheter inserted into the lumen of the stomach via a permanent gastric fistula. The catheter was connected to a physiological pressure transducer and pressure changes recorded on a hot wire pen recorder. In each animal a pre dose period of 40 minutes was allowed to obtain a measure of spontaneous activity. An index of activity was obtained by measuring the average height of pressure waves during 10 minute periods. Values for 4 such periods were obtained during assessment of spontaneous activity and for 40 minute period after administration of compound. Student s t test was applied to the difference in average values obtained for spontaneous and post compound activity. Compounds 8, 9 and 11 significantly increased the index of activity post administration at a dose level of 1.0 mg kg s.c.Anti emetic activity in the dog Compounds were administered subcutaneously 30 minutes prior to administration of a standard dose of apomorphine HC1 0.1 mg kg subcutaneously and the vomiting response compared to that obtained when the same animals were dosed with apomorphine HC1 and vehicle only. The ED50 values for inhibition of the vomiting response determined for compound 11 and 13 were 1.0 mg kg for compound 33, 0.1 mg kg and for compound 35, 0.01 mg kg. Dopamine Receptor Blocking Activity in the CentralNervous System Compounds were tested for inhibition of apomorphine induced climbing in the mouse. The test is based on that described by Protais, P., Constantin, J. and SchwartzJ.C. 1976 , Psychopharmacology, 50, 1.6. Apomorphine 1 mg kg s.c. induces mice to climb the wall of a wire cage inverted food hopper 11 x 7.5 x 18 cm high . Mice acclimatised in their home cages in groups of 5 are placed under the hoppers immediately after the injection of apomorphine 1 mg kg s.c. At 10,20 and 30 minutes after injection climbing behaviour is scored. The mice are observed for 30 seconds and scored according to the position they spend the majortiy of time in, score 0 four paws on floor of cage score 1 four paws only on walls score 2 all paws on wall of cage. The scores at all 3 times and for each mouse are summed and mice drug treated orally compared to mice receiving apomorphine only. A saline only treated group is also included and any score, generally 5 of maximum taken into account. The results were as follows Compound No. 8 10 9 50 11 34 13 I 50 I inactive Toxicity No toxic effects were observed in any of the above tests.
