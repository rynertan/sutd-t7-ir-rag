# Slider for slide fastener.

## Abstract
A slide fastener slider has an arch shaped lug 27 projecting from the front end 22a of an upper wing 22 over the top surface 22b of the upper wing 22 toward the rear end 22c thereof and terminating in a bent free end 27a directed toward the upper wing s top surface 22b and spaced apart therefrom by a gap s . A pull tab 28 is threaded on the lug 27 and thereby connected to a slider body 21 . The slider 20 also has a ridge 30 projecting from the rear end 22c of the upper wing 22 and aligned with the arch shaped lug 27 longitudinally of the slider body 21 , the ridge 30 having a width W not less than the width w of the free end 27a of the lug 27 and having a hight h not less than the gap s . The ridge 30 serves to prevent the slider 20 from being improperly mounted on a guide, as it is fed from a hopper to the next station by a parts feeder, causing smooth feeding of the successive sliders 20 .
