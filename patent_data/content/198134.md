# Remote centre compliance system.

## Abstract
A remote centre compliance system for compliantly connecting a robot support arm interface 1 to an operator device interface 11 comprises at least three gas tight spring bellows 20 interconnecting the interfaces 1, 11 and a connection means 22 for connecting the interiors of the bellows 20 in common to an external variable pressure source 28 . The compliance of the system both rotational and lateral, may be controlled by the applied pressure. The bellows 20 may also be evacuated so that their resultant collapse locks the support structure 1 and operator device 11 together.
