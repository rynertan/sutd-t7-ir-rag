# Servomotor controls.

## Abstract
Servomotor control apparatus comprises a servoamplifier to which the servomotor 10 is responsive for driving a load in accordance with a servoamplifier command signal, the servoamplifier including a power supply and signal responsive means for limiting the torque output of said servomotor, the control apparatus further comprising power amplifier means 22, 23 responsive to the command signal and including at least one transisitor 25 coupled between the power supply, the control windings of the servomotor 10 and ground for supplying motor drive current, means 41 for providing a measure of the motor current and being further responsive to the base drive current of the transistor 25 , base drive compensation circuit means 31 coupled between the power supply and ground for providing a compensation current effectively equal to the base drive current, and means 45 responsive to the compensation current for cancelling the effect of the base drive current on the motor drive current measuring means.
