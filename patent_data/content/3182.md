## Abstract
A method of and apparatus for enabling different parts of an input television signal to be made available simultaneously is used as a television standards converter. Successive lines of an input television signal are cyclically written into n e.g. 4 successive random access store sections, using in each cycle the same addresses for the different sections. The write addresses are incremented for successive cycles. The sections are read from using for each section addresses which are related to each other and to the write addresses so as to access a desired set of up to n successive lines. These lines are combined by weighted addition to provide an interpolated output line. The read addresses are derived by counting the desired output lines during each field and multiplying the count by the line conversion ratio, namely the number of lines in each input field divided by the number of lines in each output field . The integral part of the resultant controls the read addresses and the non integral part controls the weighted addition. A total storage of two fields is used, each divided into n sections. Standards conversion to either higher or lower line rates is possible with improved quality.
