# Clamp and method of making same.

## Abstract
A clamp consists of a U shaped bolt 10 cooperating with an arcuate saddle 18 of open sided channel cross section with the channel opening to the convex side. The saddle terminates in two tubular portions 20 which receive the legs 12 of the U bolt 10 and provide respective nut bearing surfaces 34 for the clamping nuts 14 of the U bolt 10 . The saddle 18 is preferably formed by stamping from a rectangular blank of thin flat sheet metal, the blank being formed into a hollow tube with the longer edges 30 in contact with one another and bent to the necessary arcuate shape. The radially outer central tube wall portion is collapsed into contact with the radially inner central tube wall portion so as to form a double walled channel section saddle 18 with the said tubular portions 20 integral therewith formed by the uncollapsed tube ends. Preferably the channel is of semi circular transverse cross section.

## Description
DESCRIPTION CLAMP AND METHOD OF MAKING SAME The present invention is concerned with clamps of the type consisting of a U shaped bolt and a cooperating so called saddle employed, for example, to clamp together two telescoped tubular members. The quantity of the said type of clamp now manufactured each year in North America alone is in the tens of millions, one of the principal applications being in the installation of automobile exhaust systems to clamp together two telescoped steel pipes of circular cross section. This particular field is exceptionally cost competitive and, as long as the clamp will perform satisfactorily, differences in price of only a fraction of a U.S. cent can mean the gain or loss of a contract involving several million clamps. It is essential therefore that the clamps be made by automatic processes, usually involving heavy metal presses, and the savings which can be made in the processes are limited. A much more fruitful approach at this time is to attempt to reduce the amount of metal required for the production of an effective clamp. It is an object of the invention to provide such a clamp of new construction. In accordance with the present invention there is provided a clamp comprising a a U bolt having a bight portion and two leg portions each at one end of the bight portion, and screw threaded at their ends for the reception of respective clamping nuts, and b a saddle formed from sheet metal with a bight portion of arcuate shape so as to have a concave side for engagement with an object to be clamped by the clamp and an opposite convex side, the saddle bight being double walled of open sided channel transverse cross section with the channel opening at the said convex side, c the saddle having at its ends respective integral tubular portions through which the legs of theU bolt extend for the clamp to surround an object between the bolt bight and the saddle bight concave side, d the tubular portions providing nut bearing surfaces for receiving the said clamping nuts of theU bolt. Such a clamp employs a smaller amount of metal than prior art clamps known to me. Also in accordance with the invention there is provided a method of making a clamp saddle for use with a U bolt comprising forming a flat metal blank to an arcuate shape with the central portion thereof constituted by a double walled radially outwardly open channel and with the ends provided with apertures for the U bolt legs to pass therethrough. In order that the invention may more readily be understood, particularly preferred embodiments of clamps in accordance with the invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying diagrammatic drawings wherein Figure 1 is an exploded perspective view of a complete saddle clamp constituting a first embodiment of the invention Figures 2a to 2d are perspective views showing the progressive formation of the saddle clamp by a series of stamping operations Figures 3 and 4 are plane sections through the clamp on the lines 3 3 and 4 4, respectively, ofFigure 1, and showing the clamp placed on two telescoped tubular members to clamp them together Figure 5 is a plan view, similar to Figure 2a, of a blank from which is to be formed a clamp saddle of a clamp constituting a second embodiment of the invention Figure 6 is a perspective view showing the blank of Figure 5 folded about a longitudinal axis to an intermediate tube shape and Figure 7 is an exploded view of the said second embodiment clamp. Similar parts are given the same reference number in all the Figures of the drawing. Each clamp consists of a U bolt 10 having a semi circular central bight portion and two parallel leg portions 12, one at each end of the bight portion, the leg portions being screw threaded at their ends and receiving respective clamping nuts 14. Washers 16 may or may not be provided for cooperation with each nut, or the nuts may be of the kind provided with integral washer portions. The clamp also consists of a saddle 18 Figure 3 of arcuate shape and terminating at its ends in two tubular portions 20 Figure 4 through which the leg portions 12 extend for the clamp to surround and clamp onto an object or objects placed between them, such as the pair of telescoped tubes 22 and 24 shown in Figures 3 and 4.The concave face 26 of the saddle is also semi circular and of extent such that it will cooperate with the semi circular bolt bight to embrace completely the circumference of the outermost tube 22. The tubular portions 20 are cut away in a V or U shape at 28 Figure 4 on the concave face 26 to expose as much as possible of the circumference of tube 22 to the U bolt bight, and eliminate as much as possible any gap in the transition of clamping contact from the bolt bight to the saddle bight. The saddle preferably is formed by stamping a suitably shaped blank from a metal sheet and is made with the central bight portion of the saddle between the tubular bolt leg receiving portions 20 of open channel cross section with the channel opening at the convex face, the central portion merging smoothly into the tubular portions 20. In the two embodiments specifically illustrated herein the channel is of semi circular transverse cross section, as seen most clearly in Figure 3, but other cross sections can also be used, such as open sided rectangular or V or U shaped. This openchannel cross section with the channel opening radially outwards permits high clamping pressures to be produced at the line of contact between the clamp and the object being clamped with the use of a minimum of metal for the saddle. Referring now to Figures 2a to 2d, a preferred form of metal blank to produce the saddle of the first embodiment is shown in Figure 2a, and is of rectangular shape having a pair of opposed longer parallel edges 30 and a pair of opposed shorter edges 32. The blank is formed into the arcuate saddle of Figure 1 by a series of metal working steps, for example on an indexing table with a corresponding plurality of dies, or using a single progressive die with the corresponding plurality of stations. In one step the blank is formed to the shape illustrated by Figure 2b, in which the two longer edges are folded toward each other until the blank assumes aU shape transverse cross section, while at the same time the blank is bent along its longer dimension to the arcuate form illustrated.In a second step which is not illustrated the end portions are shaped closer to that required to form the bolt receiving tubular portions 20, this step causing the side walls between the tubular portions to bulge outwards. The piece is therefore immediately subjected to a further step to result in the shape of Figure 2c, in which those side walls are again parallel. In the next step to produce the shape ofFigure 2d the edges 30 are rolled inwards until they abut one another to form a hollow tube, and the portion of this tube between the two portions 28 is collapsed, so that the radially outer part of the tube wall is in contact with the radially inner part of the wall to form a double walled saddle having the junction of the two edges 30 in the radially inner portion, preferably centrally located therein. At the same time the end parts are provided with co planar flat surfaces 34 for the tubular portions 20 that subsequently, after the punching of bolt leg receiving holes 36 therein, provide the nut bearing surfaces receiving washers 16 and nuts 14. The cross section of the central part of the saddle is best seen in Figure 3, while that of the tubular portions 20 is seen in Figure 4. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that a saddle of such construction has a high strength weight ratio, the double walled central portion giving extra rigidity where required while providing an elegant way of forming the tubular portions for the bolt legs 12. The location of the junction between the edges 30 is such that it is held closed by the adjacent part of the tube wall and the pressure applied as the clamp is clamped tightly cannot force the edges apart to any significant extent. In some particular applications it may be desirable to fasten the edges together, e.g. by welding or use of an adhesive, but for the most common application of such clamps, namely the clamping of automobile exhaust pipes, no such fastening is found to be necessary. In a second embodiment illustrated by Figures 5 to 7 the metal blank is also of rectangular shape, but during its formation the corners are removed to provide the V or U shape cut aways 28 upon rolling the blank about a longitudinal axis into the tubular form shown in Figure 6. The blank is provided with twoU shaped apertures 36 having their straight base edges 34 parallel and closely adjacent to the respective blank shorter sides 32, while the respective concave edges 38 extend toward each other. In the tubular form of Figure 6 these apertures form respective organpipe like openings. The tube is then shaped to the arcuate final form of Figure 7, where the blank longer edges 30 will be butted against each other, assuming that they were not so butted when the tube was rolled.As the tube is shaped the portion of the hollow tube between the two apertures 36 is collapsed, as with the embodiment ofFigures 1 to 4 to form a double walled saddle having the junction of edges 30 in the radially inner portion.The uncollapsed ends of the tube form the leg receiving portions 20, while the aperture edges 34 form the bearing surfaces for the washers 16 and the clamping nuts 14. It will be seen therefore that the present invention provides simple and effective clamps that can readily be formed by stamping and bending operations from thin sheet metal, without requiring deep drawing or acute bending, at least in the preferred embodiments illustrated. It is found for example that a prior art saddle clamp, as shown for example in my U.S. Patent No. 3,919,747, when intended for use to clamp on a tubular pipe of 5 cm diameter, requires the use of sheet steel of about 0.3 cm thickness, while a corresponding clamp of this invention employs metal of about 0.15 cm thickness. Moreover, the blank used for the production of the clamps of this invention in such a size is very much smaller and requires only about one third of the metal of my prior clamp. In addition, since the nutreceiving surfaces 34 are much closer to the diameter of the tubular members 22 and 24 the legs of the U bolts can be shorter. The resultant saving in metal produces a very significant saving in overall cost of the resultant clamps.
