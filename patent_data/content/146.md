# Blends of phenolphthalein polycarbonates with rubber modified monovinylidene aromatic copolymers.

## Abstract
Blends of ar,ar dihydroxytrityl polycarbonates, such as a copolycarbonate of phenolphthalein and bisphenol A, with a rubber modified monovinylidene aromatic copolymer, such as an ABS resin, exhibit improved impact strength, melt flow properties, resistance to stress cracking and heat resistance. Such blends are particularly useful in the manufacture of molded parts which must be exposed to high temperatures during manufacture and or use.
