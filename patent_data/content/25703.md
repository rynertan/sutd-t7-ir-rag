# Optical fibre connector.

## Abstract
In an optical fibre connector component 5 including a tubular housing 10 and three round rods 14 supported lon gitudinally side by side within the tubular housing and defining between them an interstitial space 15 for reception of an opti cal fibre or optical fibres, the tubular housing is of a material having a greater coefficient of thermal expansion than that of the material of the rods. In use, prior to introducing an optical fibre into the interstitial space 15 , the tubular housing 10 is heated to cause it to expand radially outwardly to permit radial separation of the rods 14 and introduction of the optical fibre into the interstitial space. The tubular housing 10 is then cooled or permitted to cool to cause the housing to contract radially inwardly to compress the rods 14 inwardly and cause them to grip the optical fibre so that it is aligned axially in the in terstitial space 15 .

## Description
OPTICAL FIBRE CONNECTOR This invention relates to an optical fibre connector for connecting two optical fibres end to end. More particularly, the invention is concerned with optical fibre connector components of the kind including an elongate tubular housing, at least three elongate members of substantially the same cross sectionaI shape and size as one another supported longitudinally side by side within the tubular housing and having adjacent arcuate surfaces which bound between them an intersticial space into which an end part of at least one optical fibre can be inserted and, associated with the elongate members, means. for compressing the elongate members about the optical fibre or optical fibres to align the oroeach optical fibre along and secure it in the intersticial space. An optical fibre connector component of the aforesald kind will be hereinafter referred to as of the kind described . In one method of employing an optical fibre connector component of the kind described, end parts of two optical fibres to be connected are inserted into opposite ends of the intersticial space until their neighbouring end faces abut.In another method of employing an optical fibre connector component of the kind described, one of two optical fibres to be connected is inserted in the intersticial space of one of two connector components of a multi part connector and the other of said optical fibres is inserted in the intersticial space of the other connector component, the two connector components being drawn together axially until the optical fibres therein substantially abut. We have found that, when using optical fibre connector components of the kind described that have hitherto been proposed, it is difficult to insert an optical fibre into the intersticial space bounded by the elongate elements without risk of damaging the end face of the optical fibre to such an extent as to reduce substantially the efficiency of the optical coupling between two fibres when they are caused to abut. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved method of, and an improved optical fibre connector component of the kind described for use in, connecting two optical fibres end to end, which method and connector component substantially reduce the risk of damage to an end face of an optical fibre during introduction of the fibre into the intersticial space bounded by the elongate members of the connector component. In the improved method according to the invention, the tubular housing of an optical fibre connector component of the kind described which is to be employed is of a material having a substantially greater coefficient of thermal expansion than that of the material of the elongate members in the tubular housing and, prior to introducing an optical fibre into the intersticial space bounded by the elongate members, the tubular housing is heated to a temperature sufficient to cause the housing to expand radially outwardly to permit radial separation of the elongate members and so facilitate insertion of an optical fibre into an end of the intersticial space and, after at least one optical fibre has been S inserted, th tubular housing is cooled or is permitted to cool to cause the housing to contract radially inwardly to compress the elongate members inwardly and cause them to grip the or each optical fibre in such a way that it is aligned substantially axially in the intersticial space. Preferably, heating of the tubular housing is so effected that substantially the whole of the housing surrounding the elongate members is raised to the same temperature and, preferably also, the housing is so cooled, or is permitted to cool in such an environment, that radially inward contraction of the tubular housing is substantially uniform throughout its circumference and throughout at least that part of the length of the housing surrounding the elongate members. We have found that the differential contraction of the tubular housing and elongate members is such that sufficient pressure is imparted by the elongate members on the optical fibre to hold it in position in the intersticial space with substantially no micro bending losses. The invention also includes an optical fibre connector component of the kind described in which the tubular housing is of a material having a substantially greater coefficient of thermal expansion than that of the material of the elongate members in the tubular housing. Preferably, the internal surface of at least that part of the bore of the tubular housing in which the elongate members are positioned is substantially parallel to and concentric with the outer surface of said part of the tubular housing.Preferably also, each of the elongate members positioned in said part of the tubular housing has an outer surface that is substantially parallel to the internal surface of said part of the bore of the housing. Where, as is preferred, each elongate member is of circular cross section, the internal and external surfaces of the tubular housing each has a crosssection of substantially circular form. At one or each end of each elongate member, the diameter of the member may decrease smoothly towards said end so that, at said end, the intersticial space has a mouth which facilitates initial insertion of an optical fibre into the intersticial space. Preferably, the tubular housing and the elongate members are of a metal or metal alloy and where, as is preferred, the elongate members are of an iron nickel alloy, such as that sold under the trade name Invar, preferably the tubular housing is of brass, stainless steel or other metal or metal alloy having a hard wearing surface. The optical fibre connector component of the present invention is especially, but no exclusively, suitable for use as a component part of a multi part connector. A preferred multi part optical fibre connector comprises a tubular body, two optical fibre connector components of the present invention for insertion into opposite ends of the bore of the tubular body and, associated with the tubular body, means for urging said connector components axially towards one another to cause their end faces to abut. The means for urging the connector components towards one another may comprise two gland nuts, one at each end of the tubular body, which are in screw threaded engagement with the tubular body. The invention will be further illustrated by a description, by way of example, of a preferred multi part optical connector for connecting two optical fibres end to end, with reference to the accompanying drawing which shows a side view, partly in section and partly in elevation, of the connector. Referring to the drawing, the optical connector comprises a tubular body 1 of brass having a bore 2 which is lined by a two part hollow core 3 of steel which has a bore of approximately square cross section and which is held in position between two longitudinally spaced circlips 4. In slidable engagement in opposite ends of the bore of the core 3, are two connector components 5 each of which is urged axially towards the other by an internally screw threaded gland nut 6 which screws on to an end part of the tubular body 1. Each connector component 5 comprises a body 7 of brass having a throughbore which is stepped at an intermediate position between its ends to form a part 8 of smaller diameter and a part 9 of larger diameter. The part 10 of the body 7 bounding the smaller part 8 of the bore constitutes the tubular housing of the connector component and has internal and external surfaces of circular cross section. At an intermediate position in the smaller part 8 of the bore of the body 7 is a radially inwardly extending shoulder 11, and housed in the part 8 of the bore between this shoulder and the end face 12 of the tubular housing 10, are three elongate members 14 of Invar, each of substantially circular cross section, defining between them an intersticial space 15. At the end of each of the elongate members 14 remote from the end face 12 of the tubular housing 10, the diameter decreases smoothly towards said end so that, at that end, the intersticial space 15 bounded by the elongate members has a mouth for facilitating insertion of an optical fibre. The other ends of the elongate members 14 are flush with the end face 12 of the tubular housing 10. The larger part 9 of the bore of the body 7 is internally screw threaded and houses a sealing washer 16 of resilient material and an externally screw threaded nut. 17 which is in screw threaded engagement with the body. rn using the optical connector shown in the drawingwto connect two optical fibres end to.end, before introducing each connector component 5 into the tubular body 1, the body 7 of each connector component is heated to a. temperature sufficient to cause the tubular housing 10 to expand radially outwardly to permit radial separation of the elongate members 14. In the meantime, one end of one of two optical cables C whose optical fibres are to be connected has been cut back to. expose the fibre. F and the end face of the fibre has been polished. The cut back end of the optical. cable C is then introduced into the larger part 9 of the bore of the heated body 7 and the optical fibre P is introduced into the inter sticial space 15 between the elongate members 14 until the end face of the fibre is flush with the end face 12 of the tubular casing 10 and the cut back end of the cable sheath abuts the step in the bore. The nut 17 is then tightened to compress the sealing washer 16 radially inwardly between the step in the bore and the nut to effect a substantially fluid tight seal and the body 7 is then permitted to cool to cause the tubular housing 10 to contract radially inwardly to compress the elongate members 14 inwardly and cause them to grip the optical fibre F in such a way that it is aligned substantially axially in the intersticial space 15. After each connector component 5 has been secured to an end of one of the two optical cables C, the two connector components are introduced into opposite ends of the tubular body 1 and the gland nuts6 6 are tightened until the end faces 12 of the tubular housings 10, and hence the end faces of the optical fibres F, abut in substantially axial alignment
