## Description
RADIATION CURABLE ACRYLATED POLYURETHANE OLIGOMER COMPOSITIONS This invention relates to radiation curable acrylated polyurethanes. Due to environmental concern and the high cost of solvents, commercial interest in radiation curable compositions is constantly increasing. Legislation which restricts the amount of solvents and other pollutants that can be vented to the atmosphere is one reason for this increased interest.Other reasons are the concerns expressed by unions and individuals over the possible toxic effects of prolonged exposure to volatile organic materials, and also the high cost of petroleum derived solvents. Generally, radiation curable systems are essentially 100 reactive systems, i.e., substantially all of the components react to produce the final product. Such systems can be cured by exposure to high energy ionizing radiation or to actinic radiation in the presence of photoinitiators. Among the various radiation curable compositions disclosed in the prior art are polyurethane oligomers which have terminal acrylyl or methacrylyl groups. These are generally produced by the reaction of one or more organic polyisocyanates with one or more organic polyols wherein at least a portion of the polyisocyanate or polyol reactant has, in addition to its isocyanate or hydroxyl functionality, acrylyl or methacrylyl groups. Such radiation curable polyurethane oligomers can be made by reacting a stoichiometric excess of a polyisocyanate with a polyol and then reacting the remaining isocyanate groups with Ã…a hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate. U.S.Patent No.8,7DO,643 discloses radiation curable oligomers made by reacting a polycaprolactone diol with an organic diisocyandte in a mole ratio of one to two followed by reaction with hydroxyethyl acrylate. U.S. Patent No.3,782,961 discloses the reaction of a hydroxy compound having at least 5 ether linkages and a terminal acrylate or methacrylate group with a polyisocyanate. U.S. Patent No. 4,133,723 discloses radiation curable compositions made by reacting a polyalkylene polyol having from 2 to 6 hydroxyl groups with a molar excess of a diisocyanate followed by reaction with a hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate. U.S. Patents Nos. 4,057,431 and 4,139,436 describe photo polymerizable compositions made by reacting a polyether polyol having 2 or 3 hydroxyl groups with an organic polyisocyanate and a hydroxyalkyl methacrylate. The reaction can be conducted in a diluent such as a polyethylene polyol acrylate or methacrylate. Low viscosity radiation curable compositions are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,131,602. Such compositions are made by reacting an organic diisocyanate with a combination of organic tri tetraol and organic diol followed by reacting a hydroxyalkyl acrylate. The combination of polyols is either a polyester tri tetraol polyether diol or a polyether tri tetraolpolyester diol. Additional patents which disclose radiation curable polyurethane oligomers are U.S. Patents Nos. 3,929,929 4,089,763 4,174,307 4,309,526 and 4,312,798. Constant efforts are being made to improve the properties of radiation curable compositions. In the radiation curable coatings area, there is a need for compositions which have enhanced cure response, and, after being cured, improved abrasion resistance and improved tensile strength. This invention is directed to radiation curable acrylated polyurethane oligomers having improved properties. The radiation curable compositions of this invention are acrylated polyurethane oligomers which are blends of the reaction product of an organic diisocyanate, a polyether diol and a hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate and the reaction product of an organic diisocyanate, a polyether triol and a hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate, wherein the organic diisocyanate is an aliphatic or cycloaliphatic diisocyanate, the polyether diol is a dihydroxy terminated polyalkylene oxide which contains 2 or 3 carbon atoms in each alkylene group and which has a molecular weight of 800 to 1500,the polyether triol is a trihydroxy terminated polyalkylene oxide which contains 2 or 3 carbon atoms in each alkylene group and which has a molecular weight of 300 to 750, and the alkyl group of the hydroxyalkyl acrylate contains 2 or 3 carbon atoms, the reactants being reacted in the following proportions one mole of diisocyanate is reacted per hydroxyl group of the polyether diol and the polyether triol and one mole of hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate is reacted per mole of diisocyanate, and the blends contains an average acrylate or methacrylate functionality of 2.4 to 2.6 Surprisingly, tiis invention makes it possible to provide acrylated polyurethane oligomers which have enhanced cure response and which, after being cured, have improved abrasion resistance and improved tensile strength. The invention also provides a method of producing the composition which comprises forming a blend of the specified substances in the necessary proportions. It asoprovides cured compositions made by means of radiation acting in the uncured compositions. It also provides articles which comprise a substrate bearing a coating of the cured composition. The article may be coated with the uncured compositions, which is then cured. The radiation curable compositions of this invention can be made by separately preparing each reaction product, i.e., the reaction product based on the polyether diol and the reaction product based on the polyether triol, and then blending the two products. The radiation curable composition can also be prepared by simultaneous formation of the products in situ, by preblending the polyether diol and the polyether triol in a molar ratio of 0.9 1 to 1.1 1 and then reacting this blend with the diisocyanate and the hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate. The diisocyanates useful in this invention are organic aliphatic or cycloaliphatic diisocyanates which contain two iso cyanate groups per molecule and no other groups which are reactive with hydroxyl groups. Examples of such diisocyanates are 1,6 hexa methylene diisocyanate, 1,4 Hexamethylene diisocyanate, 2,2,4 tri methyl hexamethylene diisocyanate, 2,4,4 trimethyl hexamethylene diisocyanate, 4,4 methylene bis cyclohexylisocyanate , isophorone diisocyanate and 1 methyl2,4 diisocyanacyclohexane. The preferred diisocyanates are 4, 4 methylene bis cyclohexyliso cyanate , isophorone diisocyanate and mixtures thereof. The polyether diols useful in this invention are dihydroxy terminated polyalkylene oxides having 2 or 3 carbon atoms in each alkylene group. Such polyether diols may be made by polymerizing ethylene oxide, or propylene oxide, or mixtures thereof to form block copolymers,with a dihydric initiator. Such initiators include ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, 1,2 propylene glycol,and 1,4 butanediol.Useful polyether dios have molecular weights of 800 to 1500.A most preferred polyether diol has a molecular weight of approximately 1000. The polyether triols useful in this invention are trihydroxy terminated polyalkylene oxides having 2 or 3 carbon atoms in each alkylene group. Such polyether triols are made by polymerizing ethylene oxide, or propylene oxide, or mixtures thereof to form block copolymers,with a trihydric initiator. Such initiators include trimethylol ethane, trimethylol propane, glycerol and 1,2,4 butanetriol. Useful polyether triols have molecular weights of 300 to 750. A most preferred polyether diol has a molecular weight of approximately 440. The hydroxyalkyl acrylates or methacrylates useful in this invention contain one radiation polymerizable double bond and one aliphatic hydroxyl group. The alkyl group contains 2 or. 3 carbon atoms. Such hydroxyalkyl acrylates or methacrylates are hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate and hydroxypropyl methacrylate. In preparing the compositions of this invention, the components are reacted in such proportions that the equivalents of isocyanate groups are equal to the total hydroxyl groups in the polyols and the hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate. Specifically, one mole of diisocyanate is reacted for each hydroxyl group of the polyol and one mole of hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate is reacted for each mole of diisocyanate. The polyether diol and the polyether triol are used in the molar ratios of 0.9 1 to 1.1 1. The use of these ratios results in an average acrylate or methacrylate functionality of 2.4 to 2.6. The preferred molar ratio of diol to triol is 1 1, with the average functionality being 2.5. In preparing the compositions of this invention, the reaction product of the diol and the reaction product of the triol can be made separately, followed by blending of the finished products. In an alternate procedure, the diol and triol can be blended together followed by reaction with the diisocyanate and the hydroxyalkyl acrylate or methacrylate. The components can be reacted in any order. For instance, all of the components, the diisocyanate, the polyols and the hydroxyalkyl ester can be added together and reacted. The reaction can be conducted stepwise by reacting with the hydroxyalkyl ester. Preferably, the hydroxyalkyl ester is reacted with the diisocyanate followed by reaction with the polyol. The reaction conditions forming the acrylated polyurethane oligomers are reactions well known to those skilled in the art. Generally, the reactions are carried out at o a temperature of 30 C. to 1200C., preferably BO G to 1050C. A urethane formation catalyst can be used in these reactions. Such catalysts include dibutyltin dilaurate, dioctyltin diacetate, dibutyltin oxide, stannous oleate, stannous tallate, lead octoate, triethylamine, morpholine and piperazine. In order to prevent polymerization of the acrylate or methacrylate groups during the reaction, an inhibitor can be added. Such inhibitors include hydroquinone, methyl ether hydroquinone and phenothiazine. The reaction can be conducted in a solvent or, preferably, in the absence of a solvent. If a solvent is used it can be a chemically inert solvent, such as xylene, toluene or 2 ethoxy ethyl acetate. However, if a chemically inert solvent is used, it must be removed from the reaction product when the reaction is completed in order to be able to formulate a 100 reactive curable composition. If a solvent is used, the preferred solvents are reactive solvents, i.e., solvents which contain double bonds which are polymerizable by radiation. Examples of such solvents include alkyl acrylates or methacrylates having up to 12 carbon atoms in the alkyl group such as ethyl acrylate,butyl acrylate,2ethylhexyl acrylate, lauryl acrylate, methyl methacrylate or octyl methacrylate.Other reactive solvents are alkoxyalkyl acrylates or methacrylates, such as methoxybutyl acrylate, ethoxyethoxyethyl acrylate, ethoxypropyl acrylate or ethoxyethyl methacrylate. Additional reactive solvents include allyl acrylate, phenoxyethyl acrylate, cyclohexyl acrylate, acrylonitrile, cyanoethyl acrylate, 1,6 hexanediol diacrylate,trimethylolpropane triacrylate, acrylated fatty alcohols and acrylated aliphatic diglycidyl ethers. The amount of solvent used is such that the finished product has the desired application viscosity. Generally, the amount of solvent will vary from 0 to 50 weight percent based on the total weight of oligomer and solvent, and, preferably, 10 to 20 weight percent. The radiation curable compositions of this invention can be cured by any of the known actinic radiation curing methods. The radiation can be ionizing radiation either particulate or non particulate or non ionizing radiation. As a suitable source of particulate radiation, one can use any source which emits electrons or charged nucleii. Particulate radiation can be generated from electron accelerators such as the Vander Graff accelerator, resonance transformers, linear accelerators, insulating core transformers,radioactive elements such as cobalt 60, strontium 90,etc. As a suitable source of non particulate ionizing radiation, any source which emits radiation in the range of from 10 3 angstroms to 2000 angstroms can be used. Suitable sources include vacuum ultraviolet lamps, such as xenon or krypton arcs.As a suitable source of non ionizing radiation, any source which emits radiation from 2000 angstroms to 4000 angstroms can be used. Suitable sources include mercury arcs,carbon arcs, tungsten filament lamps, sunlamps and lasers. All of these devices and sources are well known in the art and those skilled in radiation technology are fully aware of the manner in which radiation is generated and the precautions to be taken in its use. When the radiation curable coating compositions are to be cured by exposure to non ionizing radiation, e.g.ultraviolet radiation,photoinitiators may be added to the composition. Suitable photoinitiators, which are well known in the art, include 2, 2 diethoxy acetophenone, 2,3, or 4 bromoacetophenone,benzaldehyde, benzoin, benzophenone, 9,10dibromoanthracene, 4,4 dichlorobenzophenone,2,3 pentane dione, hydroxycyclohexylphenyl ketone and xanthone. Such photoinitiators are generally added in amounts up to 10 weight percent based on the weight of the total curable composition, and, preferably, 1 to 5 weight percent. Photoactivators can also be used in combination with the photoinitiators. Examples of such photoactivators are methylamine, tributylamine, n methyldiethanolamine, 2aminoethylethanolamine, cyclohexylamine, diphenylamine and tribenzylamine. The radiation curable compositions of this invention are preferably used as coating compositions. The coatings can be applied by conventional means, including spraying,curtain coating, dip padding, roll coating and brushing procedures.The coatings can be applied to any acceptable substrate,such as wood, metal, glass, fabric, paper,fiber,plastic,etc. The acrylated polyurethane oligomers can be used with no dilution or can be diluted with active solvents in order to adjust the viscosities of the system for coating applications. Suitable reactive solvents include those mentioned above. Examples of additional reactive solvents are hydroxyethyl acrylate, hydroxypropyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate and hydroxypropyl methacrylate. Additional additives which may be used include wetting agents, fillers, defoamers, dyes and pigments, the uses of which are well known in the art.
