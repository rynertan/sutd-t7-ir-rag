# Current ratio differential relay.

## Abstract
A current ratio differential relay for protecting a power system comprises a logical circuit which provides the final output upon determination that the operating force signal is active and the suppressing force signal is inactive. The operating force signal is made active when the scalar quantity of the vector summation of line currents flowing into and out of the bus bar is larger than a certain value, and the suppressing force signal is made active when the maximum value of scalar quantities of the line currents is larger than the scalar quantity of the vectorially summed current multiplied by a certain constant. Both signals are supplied to the logical circuit through circuit means having a certain time delay in the restoring operation.
