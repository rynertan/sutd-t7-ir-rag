# Process for preparing copolymer.

## Abstract
A process for preparing α methylstyrene acrylonitrile copolymer by suspension or bulk polymerization of α me thylstyrene and acrylonitrile with at least one member se lected from the group consisting of styrene, chlorostyrene, para methylstyrene, t butylstyrene, acrylic ester and meth acrylic ester in the presence of a difunctional organic per oxide having a 10 hour half life temperature of 60 to 120 C and capable of producing a t butyl radical, at a polymeriza tion temperature of 80 to 135 C. The process produces the copolymers having excellent transparency, heat resistance and strength in a high conversion in a short time.
