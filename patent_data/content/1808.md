# METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR BINARY WORD RECOGNITION

## Abstract
A stream of digital data containing an unknown word is compared bit by bit with a stored known word. The bit comparisons are counted in such a manner that the maximum output identifies the known word in the data stream. Alternatively, the non comparing bits may be counted so that a minimum output idenfities the known word.
