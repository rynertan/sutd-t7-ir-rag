# Process for separation of mucopolysaccharides.

## Abstract
There is provided a process for the separation of carbohydrates by use of hydrophobic interaction chromatog raphy, The process according to the present invention can accomplish effective separation of carbohydrates, particular ly mucopolysaccharides including heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfates, dermatan sulfate, hyaluronic acid, keratan sulfate and chondroitin polysulfates, As the hyd rophobic ligand in the chromatographic support to be used in the present invention, there may particularly be men tioned an alkyl group an alkyl group substituted with a hydroxyl group, a carboxyl group and or an amino group an aryl group or an aralkyl group.
