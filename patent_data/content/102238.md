# Method for converting radiographic images.

## Abstract
In a radiographic image conversion method in which a stimulating light is irradiated to a panel storing a radiation energy in the form of an image to reproduce and then to read out the image, the response speed of a stimulation and the reading speed of a radiographic image area increased by making use of 1 a phosphate type phosphor having the composition, xM₃ PO₄ ₂ NX₂ yA or M₃ PO₄ ₂ yA, which is a highly sensitive phosphor capable of readily releasing the stored energy when a stimulating light is irradiated to the phosphor, and 2 the stimulating light having the range of the wavelengths from a visible ray of not shorter than 500nm to an infrared ray.
