# A leg mechanism and actuator therefor.

## Abstract
A vertical actuator mechanism for the legs of a walking machine, including four links 21, 22, 23, 24 arranged in a pantograph mechanism, with one corner of the pantograph providing the main mounting point for each leg, which per mits the use of swinging links in the vertical actuator mech anism and retains complete isolation between the vertical and horizontal drive mechanisms. Vertical actuation of the pantograph mechanism is accomplished by means of a pair of long, swinging struts 31 connected between a drive nut 37 mounted on a lead screw 34 and a point 18 on the pantograph mechanism. The struts 31 are connected to the pantograph mechanism at a location other than the true pantograph point, the point 18 being selected so that the foot moves approximately linearly as the strut 31 pivots around the drive nut 37 .
