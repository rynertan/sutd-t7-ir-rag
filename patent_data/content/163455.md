A cubicle according to the invention comprises a plurality of panels hinged to each other by means of a hinge according to the invention and or provided with a door stop assembly according to the invention. A hinge and a door stop assembly constructed in accordance with the invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 shows an exploded plan view of components of the hinge, Figure 2 shows a plan view of the hinge partially assembled, Figure 3 is a perspective view of an end component of the hinge and the fixing screws of the end component, Figure 4 shows a plan view of the hinge assembly completely assembled, Figure 5 shows a plan view, partly in section, of components of the hinge used in conjunction with door stop members to make a door stop assembly, and Figure 6 corresponds to Figure 2 but shows an alternative form the hinge may take. Referring to the drawings, a hinge 1 is shown which comprises first and second channel members 2 and 3 respectively, a linking member 4 and end members 5. The lengths of the channel and linking members are preferably, but not necessarily, equal to each other. The hinge 1 is intended for mounting a first panel 6 to a second panel 7, the panels constituting, for example, the door and a wall of a toilet, shower or changing cubicle. Each channel member 2, 3 consists of an aluminium extruded section defining a first channel 8 to receive the edge of a panel 6, 7, and a second channel 9 to receive a part of the linking member 4. The interior of the channel 8 is provided with a multiplicity of teeth or serrations 10 and the channel is of rectangular section. The interior of the channel 9 defines a major arc of a circle and includes a projecting stop member 11 at the base of the channel. Two bores 12 are provided at each end of each channel member 2, 3 to receive self tapping screws for fixing the end members 5. The linking member 4 is an extruded nylon section comprising two bulbous portions 13 and 14 joined by a central section 15. Each bulbous portion 13, 14 is defined by a pair of arms 16 and 17 defining a major arc of a rightcircular hollow cylinder. The external diameter of the cylinder defined by the arms 16 and 17 corresponds to the diameter of the circle defined by the interior of each channel 9 and the arc defined by the arms 16 and 17 is such as to provide a desired degree of movement in conjunction with the stop member 11. Each end member 5 is made of plastics material and comprises a plate 18 with holes and recesses for two selftapping screws 19, and a post 20 depending from the plate.The external shape of the post 20 corresponds to the internal shape of the hollow cylinder defined by the arms 16 and 17. The assembly and use of the hinge will now be described. Each channel member 2, 3 is hammered home dnto the edge of its associated panel of the same length as the channel member using a suitable jig. Preferably, glue is inserted into the channel members prior to fixing to the panels to make the fixing more secure, Next, one bulbous portion 13, 14 of the linking member is snap fitted by virtue of the resiliency of the nylon arms 16, 17 into one of the channels 9, the other bulbous portion being left unconnected.At each end of the assembled channel member and linking member, a respective end member is now fitted, the posts 20 being inserted in the space enclosed by the arms 16 and 17 and the plate 18 screwed home by means of the selftapping screws. As many parts as are required for a particular installation can be pre assembled in this way and then delivered on site for erection. On site, assembly is completed by snap fitting the unconnected bulbous portion 13 14 into an unconnected channel member 2, 3 and fitting end members 5. In this way, a wall panel can be hinged to another wall panel, a wall panel to two other wall panels, and a door panel to a. wall panel as desired. Consideration of Figure 2, shows that two panels connected in this way are capable of moving from a position in which they are in line to a position in which they enclose a right angle, the limits of movement being defined by the ends of the arms 16 and 17 engaging the stop member 11 as the bulbous portions 13, 14 of the linking member rotate in the channel 9 which provide a bearing surface for them.The posts 20 projecting into the interiors of the hollow bulbous portion 13 and 14 prevent the arms 16 and 17 from deforming, so retaining the hinge in its assembled condition against the action of any external forces tending to pull the linking member 4 free. The channel members 2, 3 can also be used as part of a door stop assembly by snap fitting door stop members 21 into the channels 9 in place of the bulbous portions 13, 14 of the linking member 4. Such an arrangement is shown in Figure 5. Each door stop member 21 is an extruded nylon section and consists of a bulbous portion 13 defined by a pair of arms 16 and 17 similar to the arms 16 and 17 of the linking portion 4 except that the gap between the ends of the arms 16 and 17 is just sufficient to receive the stop member 11. A door stop bead 22, integrally formed with the bulbous portion 13 , projects from the bulbous portion to co operate with the bead of another door stop member 21 as shown in Figure 5. The door stop members 21 are snap fitted into place and secured with end members 5 in the same way as the linking member 4. In use one door stop member 21 would be provided on a fixed panel and an associated door stop member would be provided on a door panel. It is clear from Figure 5, that the stop members 11 prevent the door stop members 21 from rotating within the channel members. Figure 6 shows an alternative form the channel members 2 and 3 may take. As shown in Figure 6, the channel members 2, 3 are provided with an integral continuous barb 23 projecting from the bases of the rectangular channels 8. The purpose of the barbs 23 is to retain the edge of the inserted panel whilst splaying out the panel to increase the effect of the teeth 10.By this means, the security of fixing can be improved, if desired. The hinge and door stop assembly described above is inexpensive, aesthetically pleasing and quick and easy to assemble. It has other applications besides that of constructing cubicles, for examples, it may be used to hinge display panels together for use at exhibitions.The hinge is advantageous for exhibition use since the display panels can be readily demounted by snapping out the linking members once the end members have been unscrewed and removed. The hinge shown in the drawings is a double hinge by virtue of the fact that the linking member has two bulbous portions and is used with two channel members.The invention could, however, be applied to a single hinge by using one channel member with another hinge member consisting of a single bulbous portion provided with mounting means. Instead of using rectangular channels to mount a hinge according to the invention on structural components, mounting plates for fixing by screws could be provided as in the case of an ordinary door hinge. Instead of having bulbous portions which snap fit into the mouths of the channels, each bulbous portion could be a solid body so shaped that it can be inserted through and removed from the mouth of the channel only at a particular orientation outside the normal working range of the hinge. Instead of, or as well as, using teeth, serrations a barb or glue to retain the edge of a panel within a channel member, fixing screws may be inserted through the channel member and panel from the outside. The end members and or the linking members and or the door stop members may be made of metal or any otber suitable material as an alternative to plastics material. The channel members may be made of plastics or any other suitable material as an alternative to metal.
