# Impact absorbing member for footwear.

## Abstract
A midsole component 10 for a shoe comprises spaced upper and lower flexible closure layers 16, 17 spaced from a resilient intermediate diaphragm 18 by upper and lower ribs 19. A peripheral closure strip 22 extends around the edges of layers 16, 17 and is joined thereto to enclose an air space therebetween. The ribs 19 divide the air space into a plurality of air pockets through which air can be circulated or redistributed via openings such as at the ends of ribs. One rib can isolate toe and heel portions of the airspace. Valves 34,35 at opposite ends of the midsole component allow air to be introduced under pressure into the air space.
