## Description
DESCRIPTIONANTITHROMBOTIC TREATMENT Anticoagulants and antithrombotic agents are a group of compounds with diversified pharmacological actions which are used in a variety of clinical thrombotic disorders. Thrombotic disorders are generally divided into venous thromboses and arterial occlusive disorders. Venous thrombosis of the lower extremities is important, because it can cause pulmonary embolisms which may be fatal. Heparin and Warfarin are commonly used in clinical medicine for the prevention and treatment of deep venous thromboses and pulmonary embolisms. Their main pharmacological actions are to inhibit or interrupt blood coagulation activity. Platelets play an important part in arterial thrombosis. Drugs which inhibit platelet aggregation are generally regarded as potentially useful for the prophylactic therapy of arterial thrombotic disorders, including, for example, strokes, myocardial infarctions and peripheral vascular disease. Despite the availability of many agents which possess platelet anti aggregatory properties, only a few are currently under clinical trial for example Aspirin , dipyridamole and sulphinpyrazone .None of these agents exhibits unequivocal efficacy. Compounds with more specific pharmacological actions are urgently sought in order to provide better medical care for patients with these serious disorders. An anticoagulant is a substance which inhibits coagulation of the blood. A platelet antiaggregatory agent is a substance which inhibits platelet aggregation. An antithrombotic agent is a substance which inhibits the formation or development of a thrombus or thrombosis . For present purposes, the term thrombus or its equivalent includes the term embolus , unless otherwise specifically indicated.In general, an antithrombotic agent, in the presence of mammalian blood or appropriately prepared plasma, may display anticoagulant activity andior platelet anti aggregatory activity. Examples of clinical thrombotic conditions include stroke as a cerebral vascular thrombosis , myocardial infarction coronary artery disease , peripheral vascular disease, cardiac valve replacement, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. A class of active agents has now been discovered the members of which, when orally ingested and or injected, produce amelioration of a thrombotic condition in mammals including man , when used in anti thrombotically effective amounts as described below. The mechanism s by which the active agents function is are currently unknown however, an inhibition of platelet aggregation and a prolongation of normal blood coagulation time appear to be associated with their use, in the manner disclosed herein. Our copending European Patent Application No. 81302950.1 Publication No. 0043274 , from which the present disclosure has been dividend, relates to the preparation and use of groups of compounds and compo sitions containing them , which are within the class of active compounds in question. One aspect of the invention described and claimed in Application No.81302950.1 is a pharmaceutical composition which contains at least one carrier substance and, as the active treating agent, at least one organic compound which in aqueous solution furnishes one or both of bisulphite ions and sulphite ions, the composition having the ability to prolong prothrombin time in human plasma by at least 7,5 times and the ability to prolong blood partial thromboplastin time in human plasma by at least 2.0 times, each as compared to a control using a final concentration of such compound of 0.5 millimolar.The activetreatingagent preferably is selected from A compounds of the formula EMI3.1 wherein Rt is an alkyl radical containing less than 11 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl radical containing 6 to 10 carbon atoms or a monohydroxyalkyl radical containing less than l . carbon atoms, R2 is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl radical containing less than 11 carbon. atoms or monohydroxyalkyl radical containing less than 11 carbon atoms, or R1 and R2 together form an unsubstituted inorpholine, piperidine or hexamethyleneimine ring or such a ring carrying on one of its carbon atoms an alkyl radical containing less than 11 carbon atoms, R3 is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl radical containing less than 11 carbon atoms, a monohydroxyalkyl radical containing less than 11 carbon atoms or a radical of the formula EMI4.1 wherein R1 and R2 have the meanings defined above, R4 is a divalent saturated aliphatic radical containing less than 11 carbon atoms, and m is 1 or 2, n is 0 or 1 and the sum of m and n is 2 compounds of either of the formulae EMI4.2 wherein R5, R6 R7 and R8 are the same or different and each is an alkyl radical, and m and n have the meanings defined above, C compounds of the formula R CHOH SO3M wherein R is a hydrogen atom or a hydroxymehyl radical and M is an alkali metal or an ammonium group. The present invention concerns other groups of active treating agents within the afore mentioned class of active agents. In one aspect, therefore, the present invention is directed to the use of certain bisuiphite and sul phite pharmaceutical compositions as antithrombotic, anticoagulant and platelet anti aggregatory agents in mammalian medicine including human medicine . These agents are believed to be usable in both arterial and venous thrombotic conditions. In another aspect, the present invention is directed to a method for the control of and or the prevention of an embolus or a thrombus in man by oral ingestion and or by injection or the use of suppositories of a pharmaceutically effective amount of one or more compounds comprising the active agents of this invention. In another aspect, the present invention provides symptomatic and objective improvement in thrombotic including cardiovascular disease conditions, for example, abnormal coagulation or intravascular thrombosis, in man. The term symptomatic improvement , as used herein, means an improvement in a patient s subjective symptoms e.g., as reported by the patient . The term objective improvement , as used herein, means a measurable change in a patient s condition. In accordance with one aspect of this inven tion, a pharmaceutical composition for treating an actual or incipient thrombotic condition in a mammal is characterized in that it contains at least one carrier substance and, as the active treating agent at least one inorganic compound which in aqueous solution furnishes one or both of bisuiphite ions and sulphite ions, 5 such compositions having the ability to prolong prothrombin time in human plasma by at least 1.5 times and the ability to prolong blood partial thromboplastin time in human plasma by at least 2.0 times, each as compared to a control using a final concentration of such compound of 0.5 millimolar. Preferably, the active treating agent is sodium bisulphite. A process of preparation of a pharmaceutical composition of this invention, as just defined, ischaracterized in that the carrier substance, the active treating agent and any other components are combined in the sterile state and under sterile conditions so that an equilibrium reaction product of the formula is at least partly formed and portions of the resultant composition are optionally packaged in dosage unit form. In accordance with a further aspect of this invention, a method of treating a thrombotic condition in a mammal is characterized by administering to such mammal an antithrombotically effective amount of at least one inorganic compound comprising an active treating agent as defined above. More particularly, this invention concerns a process for treating a human or other mammal wherein there is introduced orally and or by injection into such mammal a pharmaceutically effective amount of an active agent of this invention as an antithrombotic agent. Sulphite and or bisulphite anions do not normally occur in human tissues or blood, so far as is now known. In medicine, arterial thrombosis is diagnosable, for example, by clinical manifestations, by arteriography and, recently, by an indium 111 platelet labelling technique see, for example, the article entitled Differential Effects of Two Doses of Aspirin on Platelet Vessel Wall Interaction In Vivo by K.K. Wu et al being published in the Journal ofClinical Investigation, August, 1981 . Also, a thrombosis is detectable, for example, from a patient s conditions symptomatically perceivable by a skilled medical practitioner and well known to the art of medicine. Objectively, various methods are available, including venography, impedance plethysmography, doppler ultrasound and the 125I fibrinogen test see, for example, the articles by Kakkar, Archives of Surgery , 104, page 152 1972 and byKelton, J.G. et al, Journal of Clinical Investigation, Vol. 62, pgs. 892 895, 1978 . The present invention does not contemplate feeding a normal patient that is, one not suffering from a thrombotic condition an active agent of this invention at a pharmaceutically effective dosage as indicated herein. The term thrombotic condition as used herein, means both a an existing thrombus including an embolus b an incipient thrombus including an incipient embolus . An incipient thrombus. or incipient thrombotic condition , as used herein, is a condition which can exist in a patient who is predisposed to the development of a thrombotic condition. For example, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia are conditions which predispose a patient to arterial thrombosis.On the other hand, surgery, trauma and bed rest, for example, predispose a patient to. venous thrombosis. Those skilled in the practice of medicine routinely determine the presence of a thrombotic condition including an actual thrombus in a patient . Preferably, the practice of this invention in vivo involves introducing into the blood of a patient such as a human, the equivalent of 1 to 100 milligrams per kilogram of mammal body weight including human per day, though larger or smaller dosage rates may be employed, if desired, within the scope of this invention.The exact amount or dose in any given case is selected to be sufficient and appropriate for achieving a desired antithroWbotic effect. In general, in carrying out the present invention, such an introduction may be commenced at a dosage rate within the range above indicated as soon as a thrombotic condition or a thrombus is found in a patient. For example, in a preferred practice of this invention, as a first step, a determination is made that a patient suffers from a thrombotic condition. Then, one starts orally feeding and or injecting such patient with at least one active agent of the present invention at an effective dosage rate in the range indicated above.Currently, an especially preferred dosage rate is 20 to 50 mg kg per day. Preferably, at least two or three spaced doses per day are given, each such dose being convenientlyXadministered around a meal time. Any convenient dosage arrangement can be employed. Not uncommonly, it is desirable or necessary to start treatment immediately upon the discovery of a patient s thrombotic condition, in order to avoid damage or injury or perhaps even death of the patient, as from an embolus. If oral administration is not convenient or rapid enough, the active agent can be directly introduced by injection into the patient, if desired, such as intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. When an active agent is directly introduced, it is preferably dissolved in an aqueous medium, the total amount of active agent introduced into such medium preferably being within the range from 1 to ii weight percent based on the total solution weight . Distilled water is preferred as the aqueous medium.If desired, conventional standardized aqueous media can be used as vehicles for such introduction for example, standard saline solutions can be used as vehicles. In order to evaluate an antithrombotic effect, it is preferable to withdraw samples of blood from a patient undergoing treatment and measure platelet aggregation. One method is described by Born inNature 194, pp. 927 929 1962 and may be used for this purpose, if desired. After administration has started, the dosage rate is preferably adjusted to a value which is sufficient to disrupt platelet function and or coagulation factors and thereby achieve a desired antithrombotic effect. An active agent of this invention is characteristically capable of exhibiting platelet aggregation both in vitro and in vivo. Also, such an active agent is characteristically capable of lengthening both PT prothrombin time and PTT blood partial thromboplastin time in vitro The dosage rate of the active agent is currently believed to be relatea to the resulting effects upon blood factors, such as inhibition of platelet aggre ration, Consequently, under this preferred procedure, use of an active agent at a suitable dose for an individual patient ameliorates that patient s thrombotic condition. Selected blood parameters of a patient are preferably determined before dosing with an active agent is started, when time permits Preferably, dosage rate adjustment is made while administration of an active agent is continuing. The amount of adjustment or incremental change in dosage is determinable by comparing a patient s measured values during administration of active agent to desired values such as the patient s own corresponding starting values or normal species, e.g. humans, values . Inhibition of platelet aggregation cam be used for such measurements. Then, the deviation, if any, from the patient s measured values is compared to the desired values the patient s starting values or normal species values, for example .Then, a change in dosage rate may be made to correct any deviation so determined. For instance, in humans, normal values for platelet aggregation are dependent upon the particular agent used for stimulation. For example, when adenosine diphosphate ADP at 3 micromolar concentration is employed, platelet aggregation values fall typically in the range from 50 to 100 of light transmission.Other stimulation agents include collagen, epinephrine and arachidonic acid. Also, in humans, normal PT waXues fall in the range from 11 to 13 seconds, while normal PTT values fall in the range from 25 to 41 seconds. If PT values and or PTT values could be measured in a given patient, for the purpose of. achieving a desired antithrombotic effectiveness, it is currently estimated that a lengthening of PTT value to 1.5 to 2 times a PTT value in such normal range in a given starting patient is appropriate or suitable for antithrombotic effectiveness, which amounts to a PTT value for a given patient of 45 to 60 second such an estimate is consistent, for example, with the lengthened PTT.values achieved in the human use of heparin, sometimes employed previously as an antithrombotic agent.Similarly, it is currently estimated that a lengthening of PT value to 2.0 times a PT value in such normal range in a given starting patient is appropriate or suitable for antithrombotic effectiveness, which amounts to a PT. value for a given patient of 22 to 26 seconds such an estimate is consistent, for example, with the lengthened PT values achieved in the human use of coumadin Warfarin , sometimes employed previously as an antithrombotic agent.The active agents of the present invention, contrary to such prior art agents, suprisingly appear to affect both PT and PTT walues in vitro in a given patient.The mechanism by which the present active agents work is apparently substantially different from, and not comparable to, the prior art agents. Study and evaluation of the active agents of this invention continues. Contrary to prior agents such as Heparin and coumadin , the active agents of the present invention appear to affect both blood coagulation factors and platelet aggregation. Conveniently and preferably, measurements of blood factors are carried out periodically, such as every 3 to 7 days, on a patient undergoing treatment nnder the practice of this invention. An active agent can be given orally, in the form of a capsule or tablet, or in the form of a solution e.g. aqueous3. Also, an active agent can be injected in the form of an aqueous solution. A particularly preferred antithrombotic field of use is in Post operative treatment, as when arteries or deep veins may be involved in, or threatened by, a thrombotic condition. By way of explanation, as those familiar with mammalian anatomy appreciate, the venous system in the lower extremities consists of superficial and deep veins. Because of the manner im which the deep veins interconnect and supply blood to the heart and lungs, a thrombus occurring in the deep veins, but not in the superficial veins1 can become the source of a blood clot which is moved through the veins and becomes lodged in the lungs, resulting in a pulmonary embolus, which can have obvious catastrophic effects including causing death . Examples of deep veins include the iliac, the femoral, the popliteal and the calf veins.The prevention of pulmonary emholi following surgery affecting the deep veins in the lower extremities is a significant medical problen One solution to this problem is to prevent thrombi from occurring and or developing in deep veins. To achieve this, active agents of this invention appear to be well suited.Thus, in carrying out this invention, one may achieve a symptomatic and objective improvement of a deep vein thrombotic complication in a patient during postoperative care, inhibiting intravascuXar thrombus formation including embolism . In one preferred practice of this invention, an aqueous solution of 1 to 10 percent by weight of an active agent of this invention, preferably sodium bisulphite, is prepared. Then, this solution is orally consumed by a human or is injected at a total or accumulated dosage rate ranging from 1.0 to 50 mg per kg of body weight per day, more preferably in the form of at least two spaced doses per day, and still more preferably in the form of at least three spaced doses per day, each dose preferably being taken around a meal time. Instead, solid or encapsulated active agents may be orally consumed. Because of a tendency for bisulphites to undergo oxidation when in aqueous solution, it is currently preferred to minimize contact of active agents with oxygen before use. It is preferred in practising this invention with inorganic alkali metal bisulphites to employ a solution which comprises, on a 100 by weight total solution basis a 1 to 10 of dissolved inorganic solids, and b the balance up to 100 of any given solution being water. In such a solution, the dissolved inorganic solids can comprise on a calculated 100 by weight dry basis a at least 50 and preferably at least 90 of alkali metal bisulphite, and b the balance up to 100 of inorganic compounds produced or producible by the oxidation of alkali metal bisulphite. The water used in such a solution is preferably purified e.g., filtered, deionized or distilled . After preparation, the solution is preferably stored in a closed container to reduce oxidation. Such an aqueous solution can be directly used in carrying out this invention, in which case such a solution can be dispensed dropwise or it can be encapsulated, for instance, and used as measured dosage units, as desired. For example, an aqueous solution containing 5 weight percent of sodium bisulphite can be injected into a patient, or it can be directly consumed by a patient as drops e.g. from 5 to 9 drops per meal for each of the two or three meals eaten by such patient per day, depending upon an individual patient s body weight . Symptomatic improvement in varicose veins and in haemorrhoids may be observable when using an active agent of this invention. Since aqueous solutions of sulphur dioxide display a capacity to lengthen PT and PTT values at least to the extent indicated above, aqueous solutions of sulphur dioxide can be used in combination with, e.g.in admixture with, aqueous solutions of compounds forming the active treating agents of this invention. One preferred aqueous composition is suitable for the treatment of thrombotic conditions selected from a deep vein thrombosis, b incipient deep vein thrombosis due to surgery, trauma, prolonged bed rest or obstetrics, c arterial thrombosis and d incipient arterial thrombosis due to diabetes mellitus or hyperlipidemia. A preferred method for treating a thrombotic condition in a mammal including man , by the present invention, is characterized by A determining from a sample of blood removed from the mammal 1 one or both of the blood coagulation factors consisting of prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time and 2 the platelet aggregation factor, B when such factors fall within normal ranges for such mammal, administering to such mammal a pharmaceutical composition according to any of claims 1 to 3 at a dosage rate and fqr a time sufficient to inhibit the blood coagulation and platelet aggregation factors to an extent which is at least sufficient to inhibit thrombus development in the mammal but insufficient to cause spontaneous internal bleeding, C at intervals during administration, removing further samples of blood from the mammal and determining the lengthened blood coagulation factor s and the inhibited platelet aggregation factor, D adjusting administration of the composition. so as to achieve and maintain predetermined desired values for the lengthened blood. coagulation factor s and the inhibited platelet aggregation factor in the mammal, and E continuing steps B , C and D until the mammal has recovered from the thrombotic condition The present invention can also be regarded as a method which can be practised in vivo or in vitro for inhibiting blood coagulation factors and for inhibiting platelet aggregation involving adding to blood and or plasma derived from such blood an active agent of this invention. The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples. Reference may also be made to the disclosures, including specific Examples, contained in the aforesaid European Application No.81302950.1 and also European Application No. 8 relating to various organic compounds, the latter having been divided out of the former, like the present disclosure. It is considered that a fuller understanding of the respective inventions can be obtained from the various disclosures when taken in conjunction. EXAMPLE A A solution of sodium bisulphite was prepared by dissolving pharmaceutical grade U.S.P. powdered sodium metabisulphite in distilled water at room temperature to form a 1 by weight solution. This solution was put into plastics squeeze bottles, each having a volume of 50 52 ml. Each bottle was provided with a cap permitting dropwise dispensing of the solution from the bottle at an estimated rate of 15 drops per ml. EXAMPLE B Example A was repeated, except that a 2.5 by weight solution was formed. EXAMPLE C Example A was repeated, except that a 5 by weight solution was formed. EXAMPLE D Example A was repeated, except that a 7.5 by weight solution was formed. EXAMPLE E Example A was repeated except that a 10 by weight solution of potassium metabisulphite was prepared. EXAMPLE F Baker analytical grade sodium bisuiphite was placed in gelatin capsules so that each capsule contained 75 mg of sodium bisulphite. EXAMPLE G Baker analytical grade sodium bisulphite was placed in gelatin capsules so that each capsule contained 50 mg of sodium bisulphite. EXAMPLE H A solution of sulphur dioxide in water was prepared by bubbling a purified grade of sulphur dioxide through distilled water at room temperature to form a 2 by weight aqueous solution. The product was then titrated with alkali using phenolphthalein to verify its concentration. EXAMPLE I A 18 by weight aqueous solution of sodium metabisulphite was prepared as in Example A. Purified SO2 gas was then bubbled through the solution to give a concentration of S02 in the solution of 1 by weight. EXAMPLE 1 That sodium bisulphite is a platelet antiaggregatory agent is shown by using a platelet aggregometer based on the technique of Born above cited . It is found that this material in a concentration of 1 millimole mM abolishes platelet aggregation in human platelet rich plasma occluded by optimal concentration of ADP, collagen, epinephrine, and arachidonic acid. A similar effect is observed in rabbit plateletrich plasma, except that slightly higher concentrations of this material are required to achieve an equivalent effect. This indicates that this material does have a significant inhibitory effect in vitro on platelet aggregation. Based on these results, it appears that this material is suitable for use as an antithrombotic agent. EXAMPLE 2 Sodium bisulphite was evaluated as an antithrombotic agent in vivo using the indium ill platelet labelling technique in rabbits see the Wu et al article above cited . The material was administered by intravenous injection 72.80 milligrams per kilogram of animal body weight . The results indicate that this material significantly reduces platelet thrombus formation on damaged aortic wall see Table I below .

F percentage of injected radioactivity per gram dry weight of tissue.The findings indicate that the active agent reduces accumulation of platelet thrombus at the damaged vessel wall by 70 . EXAMPLE 3 Sodium, potassium and ammonium bisulphites are found to prolong PT and PTT in a dose related fashion. When added to human, rabbit and rat plasma in vitro, all these agents significantly prolong PT and PTT at a concentration of 0.5 mg ml and the effects are found to be dose related. The results are shown in Table II below. The evaluation procedure used is that described in human Blood Coagulation, Haemostasis and Thrombosis , edited by Rosemary Biggs, published by BlackwellScientific Publications, Oxford, England 2nd Edition , pages 670 705, 1976. EXAMPLE 4 The effect of U.S.P. grade sodium bisulphite on blood coagulation factors was evaluated by standard prozedures Biggs and the results are shown in Table III below. The work was replicated using chemical grade sodium bisulphite and the results are shown in Table IV below. These results indicate that sodium bisuiphite at a concentration of Q. 5 mg per ml has a significant inhibitory effect on Factors IX, X, XI, XII, and VII.Factor II and Factor VIII are mildly affected by this agent. The effect is directly proportional to dose.At 5 mg ml, the coagulation of human plasma is completely disrupted. When this procedure was repeated using rabbit and rat plasma, similar results were observed, except that blood coagulation factors in these species are not as sensitive in their response to this agent. When this procedure was repeated using human plasma, but employing potassium bisulphite and ammonium bisulphite, similar results were obtained. EXAMPLE 5 The anti venous thrombotic effect of sodium bisulphite was evaluated in rabbits by using the I125 fibrinogen technique described above. Each rabbit was continuously infused with aqueous sodium bisulphite solution at the rate of 460 mg kg per hr. 2.97 grams animal body weight 2.3 kg . After 5 hours, the animal was sacrificed and the radioactive fibrinogen accumulated in the damaged jugular vein was determined.The radioactivity in the contra lateral undamaged jugular vein was also determined, to serve as a control.Concurrently, another rabbit was subjected to the same procedure, but was given only a standard sodium chloride solution, as a control. It was found to have 7 times as much radioactivity as the counterpart infused with sodium bisulphite. Thus, sodium bisulphite shows a definite positive effect in decreasing thrombus formation in the jugular vein.

EXAMPLE 6 A variety of agents were coded and evaluated under a code designation. Among these compounds, thiouracil, mercaptosuccinic acid, thiosemicarbazide, phenothiazine and sodium thiosulphate were included, so as to compare sodium bisulphite with certain compounds mentioned in USP 4,148,855. After determination of PT and PTT values, the coded compounds were decoded. The bisulphites and sulphites showed an effect in vitro and only one other compound sodium formaldehyde bisulphite was effective in increasing PT and PTT values. The results are shown in Table V, where mean values of 5 replications in each case are reported.The findings demonstrate the reliability of the. test method. This procedure was repeated with some additional compounds on two different days using a different control on each day. The results are shown in Table VI below. These data indicate that the active moieties are probably the bisulphite and suiphite groups. EXAMPLE 7 Five rats, each in a separate cage, were given a bait containing 0.5 percent by weight of sodium bisulphite. The bait consisted of cracked grains wheat, corn, millet and corn meal . The amounts of bait eaten were summarized for an eleven day period.The first day determination of PT showed that three of the rats had an increase of PT values with no apparent change in PTT TABLE VII .

The case history and observations are summarized individually below. In each case, each patient was provided with a bottle of Solution D, unless otherwise noted, and was instructed to dose himself or herself, as the case may be from the bottle so provided at the rate of seven drops to be taken orally with each of his her three daily meals. When the contents of one such bottle were thus gradually consumed by an individual patient, another was provided. CASE I A man now aged 33, height 5 10 , weight 88.8 kgs., had a myocardial infarction at the age of 29. He had been treated with heparin as an anticoagulant and also with vasodilator agents. It was felt that he had coronary atherosclerosis and hypertension. He was also on a special low salt, low fat diet. This man improved symptomatically in the patient s estimation after about 2 weeks of treatment with Solution D. A gradual lowering of his heparin dose was achieved and also of his vasodilator medicines.With continuance of the treatment, this man has been enjoying good health for about 3 years. It is reported that after an initial period of use of Solution D as described, this man s dosage rate was increased to 8 drops taken three times a day. CASE II A woman, now aged 64, height 5 5 , weight 86.3 kgs., had a long history of severe varicose veins in her legs, and the right leg had become so swollen that she could scarcely walk. After about 1 month of treatment with Solution D, the swollen leg returned to normal, and her varicose condition improved as demonstrated by reduced size of the varices. After about 4 years of continuous use of Solution D, no recurrence of her original condition has resulted. CASE III A man, aged 72 at death, height 6 , weight 86.4 kgs., suffered an injury to his leg complicated by an embolus, which apparently had its inception in the leg, moved to the brain, and paralyzed the right side of his body. Subsequently,he began to have thrombophlebitis in both his legst After use of Solution D was started, his phlebitis gradually disappeared. Beneficial results began to be observed in about two weeks. However, his hemiparesis did not regress he continued to be bed ridden It is reported that after an initial period of use of Solution D as described, his dosage rate was increased to 9 drops taken three times a day.After almost three years of continuously usingSolution D, he had not experienced any return of phlebitis to his legs. However, this man died from a kidney infection. CASE IV A man, now aged 79, height 5 11 , weight 82 kgs., had mild hypertension, mild arthritis, mild arrhythmia, haemorrhoids, dyspepsia, cyanotic fingers and toes, mild diabetes, general malaise and lassitude.After his gall bladder had been removed at age 66, his digestion deteriorated. His diabetes was acquired shortly before treatment with sodium bisulphite began and has been controlled continuously since with Diabinese 500 mg daily . After oral ingestion of aqueous solutions of sodium bisulphite of various concentrates Solutions A, TABLE VIIFIVE 250g RATS FED BAIT CONTAINING 0.5 SODIUM BISULFITERAT 1 RAT 2 RAT 3 RAT 4 RAT 5DAYS g bait eaten g bait eaten g bait eaten g bait eaten g bait eaten 1 day 27.8 25.9 26.7 28.0 27.0 2 days DIED 27.9 17.3 DIED 8.0 3 days 19.2 19.4 11.4 4 days 18.9 10.1 10.4 9 days 26.8 27.8 25.7 10 days 22.7 26.2 26.3 11 days 23.8 21.0 22.8FIRST DAY RAT 1 RAT 2 RAT 3 RAT 4 RAT 5BLOOD FACTOR PT PTT PT PTT PT PTT PT PTT PT PTT 26 150 24 150 28 150 27 70 increase increase increase B, C or D at dose rates varying from to 20 drops per meal, all of the above identified con ditions improved except for diabetes within 2 3 months. Thereafter they gradually disappeared and never recurred.After about seven years of continuous experimental use, the man remains in good health, and is alert and vigorous with excellent colour. After about 3 4 years of use, the man found that he had a prolonged blood clotting time whereupon he reduced his dosage rate somewhat to about 8 drops per meal per day of Solution D and his blood clotting time then normalized. Samples of about 4 cc each of his blood were prepared. To each of these was added about 10 drops of a 10 weight percent solution of sodium bisulphite in distilled water. Each sample was then sealed into a glass vial. After about 2i years of storage at ambient temperatures, these blood samples have not coagulated. At the time when prolonged clotting time was observed, the man was orally taking about 7 to 10 drops per meal per day of Solution E and his clotting time was estimated to have increased from about 5 9 minutes to 10 to 20 minutes. Before taking this medication, this same man also had a blood cholesterol value which oscillated between 200 and 220 mg t. After about 5 years of taking this medication as described above, this man was found to have a blood cholesterol value of about 144 mg , which value this man continues to keep through con tinued treatment by sodium bisulphite solutions as described above CASE V A man reported to be of average weight, had been in an automobile accident about 20 years previously, as a result of which his pelvis was broken and his legs were broken in many places. Then and now, the man smokes cigarettes heavily. Over a year after the accident, when the man had slowly begun to regain use of his legs without crutches, clotting problems in his leg veins developed.The main vein in his left leg was replaced with a plastic vein which his body rejected. A second plastic vein was implanted and later blood clotting rendered it useless. A third plastic vein was implanted which has been effective for many years down to the present time.His sciatic nerve was damaged during the third vein implant operation. However, his left leg gradually became difficult to use and displayed severe swelling and paresthesia. His right leg also had some swelling problems. Seven years after this third plastic vein had been in place, use of Solution C was started at a rate of about 7 drops with each of three daily meals. Gradually, swelling was reduced to normal in both legs and the parasthesis disappeared. After preliminary treatment with Solution C,Solution D was substituted for Solution C at about the dose rate 7 drops with each of three daily meals .Physiotherapy is being used. Use of Solution C has not improved or changed the damage to his sciatic nerve, but walking has become easier.
