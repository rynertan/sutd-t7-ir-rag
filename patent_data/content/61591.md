# Randomly accessible memory display and method of using it.

## Abstract
A randomly accessible memory display 2 is disclosed wherein a latching memory panel can be placed in direct optical contact with the triggering electroluminescent panel 12 having a similar matrix. Once the glowing light from the trigger panel 12 shines on the photosensitive resistive layer 8 providing positive feedback, the corresponding region in the latching memory panel is latched. In accordance with the invention, a technique is disclosed for electrically reading the latched state in any one cell. This is done by selectively propagating a high frequency sinusoidal interrogation signal through each of the Y axis lines 6 connected to the cells and measuring any phase alteration in each of the X axis lines 18 connected to the cells, for each Y axis line interrogated. Since the resistance of the photosensitive resistor for a particular latching cell is altered if that cell is emitting light, the impedance of the cell is changed, thereby introducing a phase shift to the interrogation signal. The detection of the phase shift indicates whether the selected cell is latched in its light emitting or light extinguished state.
