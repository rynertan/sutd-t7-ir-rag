# An artificial fur and a method for manufacturing the same.

## Abstract
In an artificial fur made from a pile cloth provided with a ground construction 4 and numerous pile fibres projected upward from the ground construction, the pile fibres consist of a first group of pile fibres 2 which form a layer of guard hair in the fur and a second group of pile fibres 3 which form a layer of under fur in the fur, wherein each fibre of the first group is provided with a tapered free end portion and a tapered end portion firmly held by the ground construction the pile fibers 2 of the first group are longer by a distance P₁ P₂ than the pile fibres 3 of the second group, while the thickness of the main portion of the former is thicker than the thickness of the latter. The above mentioned artificial fur is manufactured by a first step of forming a material pile cloth provided with a ground construction 4 and numerous yarn like piles pro jected upward from the ground construction, and a second step of raising the side of said yarn like piles. An intermedi ate step of applying a backing treatment to the pile cloth to form a backing 5 is preferably applied as a process between the above mentioned two steps of processing. As a final process, a finishing process is applied to the material pile cloth. A conventional dyeing process can be applied.
