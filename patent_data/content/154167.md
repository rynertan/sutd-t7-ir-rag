# Holder for a sample cell, particularly for use in liquid chromatography.

## Abstract
The invention is directed to a sample cell and a holder for a sample cell. The sample cell forming a flow thru sample cell and being mounted in a radiation detecting device, specifically a fluorescence liquid chromatography detector. The holder comprises a base, a first mount for the sample cell carried by said base, an arm, a second mount for the sample cell carried by said arm, means for coupling said base and said arm for pivotal movement one relative to the other about an axis between a first position with said first mount and said second mount in spaced relationship one with respect to the other on opposite sides of a sample cell to hold the sample cell therebetween and a second position with said first mount and said second mount further spaced one from the other than in said first position to enable removal and disposition of a sample cell therebetween, said pivotal coupling means including a pair of elements on said axis and cooperable surfaces respectively carried by said arm and said base and engaged with said elements to enable relative pivotal movement of said arm and said base about said axis, a pair of said surfaces and one of said elements having cooperating shapes to prevent relative movement of said arm and said base in a direction parallel to said axis and another pair of said surfaces and the other of said elements having cooperating shapes to permit relative movement on the surfaces of said other pair thereof in an axial direction whereby repeatable accurate alignment of said mounts one with respect to the other in said first position thereof is obtained enabling accurate location of the sample cell therebetween.
