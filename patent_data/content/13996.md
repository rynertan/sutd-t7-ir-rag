The new reactive azo compound of this invention is applicable to natural and synthetic fibers such as wool, silk, polyamide, cotton, viscose rayon, regenerated cellulosic fiber, but it is particularly suitable for dyeing cellulosic fibers. As examples of cellulosic fibers used for the dyeing method of this invention cellulosic fibers such as cotton, linen, viscose rayon, viscose staple fiber, cupra, and their mixed spun, woven and knitted products may be mentioned.The compounds of this invention are advantageously applicable for dyeing cellulosic fibers by usual dip dyeing, printing or padding. As examples of acid binding agents used in dyeing, for example, sodium hydrogen carbonate, sodium metaphosphate, trisodium phosphate, sodium ortho or meta silicate, sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide may be mentioned. When the compound of this invention is applied using a relatively long liquor to goods ratio, for example, a batch type dip dyeing method, a dye bath is usually prepared with an inorganic salt such as sodium chloride or sodium sulfate and the dyestuff, then dyeing is effected at 30 1000C for 10 60 minutes, an acid binding agent is added, and the dyeing is further proceeded at 60 l000C for 20 60 minutes. The acid binding agent may be added to the dye bath at the start of the dyeing, or it is also poss.ible to effect the dyeing first under neutral conditions and then fixing the dyestuff by by using another bath con taining an acid binding agent and inorganic salt. When the compound of this invention is applied using a relatively short liquor to goods ratio, for example, a continuous or semi continuous dyeing method, a dye bath is usually prepared with a dyestuff, an acid binding agent, a penetrant and, if necessarybradding urea, then the fibers are dipped in the bath for a short time, squeezed, and left to stand at room or elevated temperature or subjected to steaming or baking for a short time. In some cases the fibers may first be dipped in a solution of the acid binding agent and then padded in a neutral dye bath. Otherwise the fibers may first be padded in the neutral dye bath, treated with a solution of the acid binding agent saturated with an inorganic salt, and left to stand or treated with heat. When the compound of this invention is used for printing, the fibers are usually treated with a colour paste formed by incorporating the dyestuff, an acid binding agent and urea into a stock paste such as sodium alginate or an emulsion paste. The printed fibers are then either subjected to intermediate drying followed by heat treatment or left to stand at room or elevated temperature to fix the dyestuff.On occasion the fibers may first be immersed in a solution of an acid binding agent, and then be printed with a neutral colour paste and left to stand or treated with heat. After the above mentioned dyeing, padding or printing process, the coloured fibers are washed with water or, if necessary, are subjected to hot soaping in a solution containing a surfactant. The azo compound of this invention fixes on fibers at a high rate. Therefore, it is very easy to remove from the unfixed azo compound the fibers dyed or printed and thus it is possible to save substantially time and cost required for rinsing fibers. It is also a great advantage of the compound of this invention that the dyeings of deep shade can be obtained with a relatively small quantity of. the reactive azo compound, because the side reaction of reactive azo compound with water is very slight. Moreover a bright shade of dyeings is also characteristic of the reactive azo compound of this invention and there is no dullness of the shade which occurs generally when two reactive groups are introduced. The following examples illustrate the present invention, but they are not intended to limit it thereto. In the following examples, parts are by. weight. EXAMPLE l 38.3 parts of 2 naphthylamine 3, 6, 8 trisulfonic acid were dissolved in 400 parts of water under neutral conditions and diazotized with 22 parts of 35 hydrochloric acid and 6.9 parts of sodium nitrite. 15.1 parts of 3 aminophenylurea were added to the resulting mixture and then sodium carbonate was slowly added to make a neutral solution. After the coupling has been completed, 18.4 parts of cyanuric chloride were added to the solution at a temperature below 200C and stirred for 3 hours while keeping the pH at 4 7 with sodium carbonate. Upon completion of the condensation, 34.5 parts of a compound represented by the formula EMI8.1 were added and the reaction was carried out at 40 500C while keeping the pH at 7.5 8 with sodium bicarbonate.When the reaction ended, red crystals were salted out by addition of 15 common salt to the quantity of the solution. The product thus obtained was a reddish yellow reactive azo compound which is represented by the formula in the free acid form EMI8.2 X max. 430 rim and can print the cellulosic fibers to produce dyeings having excellent fastnesses and bright shade. The compound of formula 11 was prepared by first condensing 17.3 parts of aniline Orsulfonic acid with 18.5 parts of cyanuric chloride, further condensing 6.o parts of ethylenediamine with dihydrochloride at 50 600C and a pH of 4 6, filtering and washing thoroughly with water. Gken the compound of the formula EMI9.1 was used as the condensing component in place of t he compound of formula 11 above, an azo compound represented by the formula EMI9.2 max. 430 nm was obtained. The fastness of the compound is almost equal to that of the compound of formula 12 . EXAMPLE 2 To 69.3 parts of the compound of the formula EMI9.3 which was synthesized by the method as described inExample 1, was added an aqueous solution of 6 parts of ethylenediamine and 18 parts of 35 hydrochloric acid, condensation was carried out at 30 400C and a pH of 4 6, then salt was added and filtered. To this was added the condensation product obtained with 18.5 parts of cyanuric chloride and 17.3 parts of aniline 4 sulfonic acid and the reaction was carried out for 3 hours adjusting the temperature to 40 50 C and the pH at 8.After completion of the reaction, crystals are salted out by addition of 108 salt to the quantity of the.reaction solution. The product thus obtained is an azo compound which is represented by the formula in the free acid form EMI10.1 k max 431 nm and can produce dyeings having excellent fastnesses. EXAMPLE 3 In a similar manner as described in Example 1, 38.3 parts of 2 naphthylamine 3, 6, 8 trisulfonic acid were diazotized, and to this were added 15.0 parts of 3 acetylaminoaniline then coupling was carried out while adjusting the pH to 5 6 with sodium carbonate.After coupling, 18.4 parts of. cyanuric chloride were added by itself or as its acetone solution and condensed at a temperature below 20 C and a pH of 4 After the condensation is completed, 34.5 parts of the compound of the formula EMI10.2 were added to complete the reaction at 40 50QC keeping the pH at 7.5 8.0 with 20 parts of sodium bicarbonate. Then by addition of 10 salt to the quantity of the solution, there were salted out red crystals which are represented by the formula in the free acid form EMI11.1 A max. 420 nm This azo compound printed cellulosic fibers to produce a dyed cloth having bright shade and excellent fastnesses. EXAMPLE.4 To 71.8 parts of the compound of the formula EMI11.2 which was prepared in the manner as described in Example 2, there were added 18.4 parts of cyanuric chloride at a temperature below 200C and condensed while adjusting the photo 7 8.
