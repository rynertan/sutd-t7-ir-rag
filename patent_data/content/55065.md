# MAGNETIC FLUID

## Abstract
This invention provides a magnetic fluid having a rich hue and containing an organic compound as dispersion medium. The magnetic fluid of this invention is constructed by mix ing, into a magnetic dispersion, a colorant prepared by before hand treating a coloring material with a solubilizing treating agent or a dispersibilizing treating agent. Said solubilizing treating agent or dispersibilizing treating agent has a hydro phobic group and a functional group adsorbable or linkable to said coloring material. As said coloring material, a dyestuff, an organic pigment or an inorganic pigment is used. A colorant prepared by subjecting an intermediate of said coloring mate rial to said treatment is also usable. Further, a colorant pre pared by pretreating a coloring material so as to give the color ing material an adsorbability or a linkability to said solubilizing treating agent or dispersibilizing treating agent and then sub jecting the beforehand pretreated coloring material to said treatment is also usable. The magnetic fluid of this invention can retain its initial hue stably for a long period of time, and its hue can be changed without substantially changing the properties of mag netic fluid such as magnetization, viscosity and the like. Accor dingly, the magnetic fluid of this invention can be applied ex tensively to all the use fields of magnetic dispersions, and it ex hibits a particularly great effect when applied to uses of devel oper or ink in the field of printing and recording.
