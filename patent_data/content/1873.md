## Description
Title Method of C C Coupling This invention relates to a commercially advantageous method of carbon carbon bond formation. Carbon carbon bond formation reactions hereinafter sometimes referred to as C C coupling constitute an important class of reactions in the art of organic synthesis, and a variety of such reactions have been hitherto proposed. Thus, it is known that a C C coupling can be accomplished with respect to a methylene group adjacent to one of S , SO , S02and similar groups, by first activating carbanionizing the carbon atom of the methylene group with a strongly basic lithium compound such as n butyllithium, phenyllithium, lithium diethylamide or the like, and thereafter causing an electrophilic agent to act upon the carbanion.However, this type of reaction must usually be conducted in a dry ethereal solvent such as dry tetrahydrofuran or diethyl ether together with a cosolvent such as hexamethylphosphoramide HMPA , in an inert gaseous atmosphere and at a low temperature of around 700C. In view of the need to use, as just described, a lithium compound, an anhydrous solvent and a low reaction temperature, for instance, such a method cannot be considered commercially advantageous. In particular, because of the recently suspected carcino genicity of HMPA, it is desirable to avoid using this solvent as much as possible. We have now succeeded in the establishment of a novel and commercially profitable method of C C coupling with respect to isoprenoid derivatives having a methylene group adjacent to an SO2 group. This invention is therefore directed to a method for producing a polyisoprenoid compound by carbon carbon bond formation characterized in that a sulfonyl compound of the formula RÚCH2Y IV wherein Y is lower alkylsulfonyl or arylsulfonyl, and R1 is isoprenoid or polyisoprenoid, is reacted with a halogeno compound of the formula XCH2Rê III wherein X is halogen and R2 has the same meaning as R1, in a polar solvent and in the presence of sodium hydride, potassium hydride, sodium tert. alkoxide, potassium tert. alkoxide, sodium amide or potassium amide, to yield a compound of the formula EMI2.1 wherein Y, R1 and R2 have the same meanings as defined above, which, in turn, is subjected to a reductive desulfonylation of the group Y, whereby a compound of the formula RÚCH2CH2Rê I wherein R1 and R2 have the same meanings as defined above, is obtained. Referring to the above formulae, the lower alkylsulfonyl group Y is preferably a sulfonyl group whose alkyl moiety contains about 1 to 4 carbon atoms e.g. methyl or ethyl , and the arylsulfonyl group, as represented by Y is preferably benzenesulfonyl, toluenesulfonyl or the like. Among them, arylsulfonyl is preferably employed. The halogen X is preferably chlorine or bromine. The isoprenoid or polyisoprenoid group, as designated by RÚ or Rê, may be for example a group of the following formulaEMI3.1 wherein R3 is hydrogen or hydroxy which m optionally he protected R4 is hydroxy, which may optionally be protected, or a group of the formula EMI4.1 wherein each R5 is methyl or methoxy, or two R5 groups, taken together, represent a group of the formula CH CH CH CH . and Z is hydrogen or a protective group or the corresponding quinone Y is hydrogen or is the same as Y defined hereinbefore and n is an integer 0 to 10 inclusive. It should be understood that, although in the above formulae Va and Vb the isoprenoid moieties are shown in the trans oriented forms for the sake of convenience, they may alternatively be in the cisoriented form. The protective group on the protected hydroxy 3 groups R and R4 and the protective group designated by Z may both be any one of the protective groups usually employed in the art, provided they are capable of protecting the respective hydroxy groups. Thus, for example, C14 alkyl e.g. methyl, ethyl , C14 alkoxymethyl e.g. methoxymethyl or ethoxymethyl , aralkyl e.g. benzyl, nitrogenzyl or methoxy benzyl , acyl e.g. alkanoyl groups containing up to 4 carbon atoms such as acetyl or propionyl, benzoyl, p nitrobenzoyl or phenylacetyl , tetrahydropyranyl and tetrahydrofuranyl may be mentioned. Above all, methoxymethyl, benzyl, acetyl, tetrahydropyranyl and tetrahydrofuranyl are particularly desirable.Where R1 or Rê in the starting compound IV or III , as the case may be, is a group of the formula Vb , it is preferabl that R4 should be a hydroxy group which may optionall be protected or a group of the formula VI where Z is a protective group. Y is hydrogen or a group represented by Y which has been described hereinbefore and may occur in an optional combination related to the n number of isoprenoid units in the formula Va . The polar solvent employed in the method of this invention may be for example dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, tert butyl alcohol, tert amyl alcohol, dimethylsulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran or 1,2dimethoxyethane. Above all, dimethylformamide, tertbutyl alcohol and tetrahydrofuran are particularly desirable. These solvents may be employed either aloz or in a mixture with other solvents. The aforesaid sodium hydride, potassium hydride, sodium tert alkoxide, potassium tert alkoxide, sodium amide or potassium amide hereinafter sometimes referred to generally as a basic reagent is used for the purpose of converting the methylene carbon of the sulfonyl compound IV into a carbanion. As examples of the sodium or potassium tert. alkoxide, there may be mentioned alkoxides of 4 to 6 carbon atoms such as sodium tert. butoxide, potassium tert. butoxide, sodium tert. amyloxide and potassium tert. amyloxide. Among the basic reagents, sodium hydride, sodium terti butoxide and potassium tert. butox .de are particular 1 advantageous. The method according to this invention is now explained in detail. First, the reaction of a sulfo compound IV with halogeno compound III may be carried out either by dissolving the compound 1V previously in a polar solvent, adding the basic reagent to the solution to produce a carbanion and finally adding III , or by dissolving both of the compounds IV and III in a polar solvent and then adding the basic reagent . While the reaction proceeds more or less satisfactorily in the presence of air, it is preferably conducted in an inert gaseous atmosphere e.g. nitrogen, helium or argon . The molar ratio of IV to III is normally 1 1, although one of the materials for C C coupling may be used in excess depending on the particular species of compounds employed.The proper amount of the basic reagent depends on the number of Y sulfonyl groups occurring in the starting material normally, it is advantageous to employ abort 1 to 2 equivalents per Y group. While the reaction rate depends on the rate of formation of the carbanion, the reaction normally proceeds rapidly and goes to completion within 2 hours in many cases. The reaction may be carried out satisfactorily in the range of from 100 to 300C and need not particularly be conducted at a very low temperature. This coupling reaction is never accompanied by an isomerization at the double bond of the isoprenoid containing compound in other words, the cisor trans configuration of the starting compound is retained. The coupling product II obtained by the above reaction can be isolated by procedures conventional per se. The above coupling product 11 may be isolated beforehand or the reaction mixture containing II as such may be directly subjected to the reductive desulfonylation with respect to the lower alkylsulfonyl or arylsulfonyl group Y. In either case, the conteE ated compound I can be obtained by this reductive desulfonylation. The said reductive desulfonylation may be conducted by various procedures known per se.Thus, for example, reduction with an amine e.g.ethylamine, methylamine, diethylamine or ammonia any an alkali metal e.g. lithium, sodium or potassium , reduction with sodium amalgam and reduction withRaney s nickel may be mentioned. When there is a reducible group in the substituent R1 or R2 of the compound II , this reductive desulfonylation not only results in the elimination of Y but may also result in the reduction of such a reducible group. For example, when R1 or 92 of the compound II contains a reducible CH CH CH CH group as formed by two groups R5 taken together, the elimination of Y may be accompanied by the reduction of this particular reducible group, giving rise to a desired compound containing a CH2 CH CH CH2 group.Further, when there is a protective group e.g. benzyl which is reductively removable, the elimination of Y may be accompanied by the removal of the protective group. In the above procedure, when the substituentR4 of the product is the hydroquinone group VI , it may be converted to the corresponding quinone by a conventional oxidation procedure e.g. oxidation with ferric chloride, air oxidation or oxidation with silver oxide . The desired compound I produced in the above manner can be isolated from the reaction mixture and purified by conventional separatory purification procedures e.g. chromatography or distillation . The method according to this invention can be applied to the production of polyisoprenoid compounds such as polyisoprenoid hydrocarbons e.g. squalene , polyprenyl alcohols such as tetraprenyl alcohol, pentaprenyl alcohol, hexaprenyl alcohol, heptaprenyl alcohol, octaprenyl alcohol, nonaprenyl alcohol inclusive of solanesol , decaprenyl alcohol, undecaprenyl alcohol, dodecaprenyl alcohol, tridecaprenyl alcohol, hexadecaprenyl alcohol or eicosaprenyl alcohol , ubiquinones e.g. ubiquinone 7, ubiquinone8, ubiquinone 9 or ubiquinone l0 , menaquinones e.g.menaquinone 4, menaquinone 5 or menaquinone 9 , tocoquinones and other like polyisoprenoid compounds. The present method has a number of commercially advantageous features. These advantages include the following, among others 1 The method involves the use of a basic reagent which is relatively inexpensive and safe, and hence easier to handle than the strongly basic lithium compound hitherto employed. 2 The reaction can be conducted under ice cooling or at temperatures near room temperature about 10 to 300C and need not be carried out at temperatures as low as about 700C. 3 The method achieves excellent reaction yields and very high stereo specificity. 4 In the present method, it is possible to employ a solvent which is inexpensive, non inflammable and safe to human beings and unnecessary to employ a strictly dehydrated solvent. 5 The reaction may be satisfactorily carried out in the ordinary atmosphere and need not necessarily be conducted in an inert gaseous atmosphere. 6 The method involves the use of readily available starting materials and permits the formation of C C bonds without affecting the chemically labile functional groups in starting materials. The starting compounds IV and III employed in accordance with this invention may be easily produced , for example by the general method set out below, or other known methods, from known compounds cf.

The mixture was stirred for 20 minutes, whereby a deep blue solution was obtained. This solution was cooled to 350C and a solution of the coupled compound II EMI25.1 5.35 g, 10.0 m moles in THF 25 ml was added dropwise.After the dropwise addition was complete, the reaction was carried out under the same conditions for an additional 10 minutes, at the end of which time the excess anion radical was quenched by the addition of isoprene 2 ml . To this reaction mixture were added methanol 40 ml and water 70 ml . The mixture was then concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue was extracted with isopropyl ether. The organic layer was washed, dried Na2SO4 and concentrated. The residue was chromatographed on silica gel and developed with hexane isopropyl ether 1 1 .By the above procedure there was obtained the desired compound I HO C Prt 4Ht 2.56 g, 88.3 . Table 2 below Example II 16 Under an argon atmosphere, ethylamine 20 ml was cooled to 200C, followed by the addition of lithium 300 mg and the coupled compound II EMI25.2 1.20 g, 1 m mole . The mixture was stirred for 30 minutes, whereupon it began to assume a blue colour.This blue solution was stirred for an additional 10 minutes. Thereafter, the excess radical anion was quenched by the addition of isoprene 0.5 ml . The ethylamine was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was added to deaerated cold THF 30 ml containing 15 of acetic acid, care being exercised to avoid exposure to air. To this solution was added 10 aqueous ferric chloride 20 ml , followed by stirring for one hour. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and the concentrate was extracted with hexane. The organic layer was washed with water, dried and concentrated, whereby a crude product was obtained. This product was chromatographed on silica gel and developed with hexane isopropyl ether 2 1 . By the above procedure there was obtained ubiquinone l0 630 mg Table 2 below .In IR and NMR spectra, this product was found to be identical with the ubiquinone l0 obtained from bovine heart.Example II 20 Under an argon atmosphere, ethylamine 20 ml was cooled to 200C. Then, lithium 300 mg and the coupled compound II EMI26.1 661 mg, 1 m mole were added. The reaction was conducted until a blue solution was obtained. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was extracted by the addition of hexane 50 ml and water 20 ml . The product was isolated in the conventional manner. By the above procedure there was obtained a dihydronaphthalene derivativeEMI27.1 This derivative was dehydrogenated in benzene 20 ml using 2,3 dichloro 4 ,5 dicyano 1,4 benzoquinone 230 mg .The resulting product was isolated in conventional manner. By this procedure there was obtained menaquinol4 dimethyl ether 403 mg . This dimethyl ether compound 403 mg was dissolved in a mixture of dioxane 20 ml and ether 20 ml and the solution was cooled to 150C. To this solution was added silver oxide AgO, 800 mg , followed by the addition of 4N nitric acid 0.8 ml .The mixture was stirred at 100C for 10 minutes. To this was added hexane 100 ml and the organic layer was washed with water, dried Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was chromatographed on silica gel and eluted with benzene. By the above procedure there was obtained menaquinone 4 280 mg see Table 2 .
