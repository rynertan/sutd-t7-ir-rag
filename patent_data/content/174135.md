# Heat developable color light sensitive material.

## Abstract
A heat developable colour light sensitive material com prising a support and at least three light sensitive layers which comprise a yellow, magenta and cyan dye donator substance respectively and which each further comprise light sensitive silver halide grains, an organic silver salt, a reducing agent and a binder, the total amount of binder in the layers being from 3 to 10g per mÂ² of the support, is a material which has high maximum density, low fog, excel lent colour separability and excellent diffusion transferability from the bottom layer.
