# Process and apparatus for coating the surfaces of containers with coating material.

## Abstract
A series of containers 13 to be coated with a liquid plastics material which subsequently hardens are moved by a chain conveyor 2 and are at the same time rotated in holders 1 on the conveyor by gear wheels 5 driven by a chain 6 . The containers pass first through a priming zone 20 and are then moved in succession vertically downwards by a vertical length of the conveyor. The uppermost container in the downward vertical path is sprayed with the plastics material from a bank of nozzles 10 . The containers are then moved through a drying zone 15 and a cooling zone 16 . It has been found that by coating the containers while they are being moved vertically downwards and are being rotated, a very uniform coating can be obtained and also the supply of liquid coating material to the nozzles 10 can be continuous without any of the material missing the containers and being wasted.
