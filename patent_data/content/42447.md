# Flow control mechanism for block switching nodes.

## Abstract
In a communication network comprising block switching nodes interconnected by transmission links, a flow control mechanism is provided in each switching node for regulating the flow of addressed data blocks or messages. A hardware look ahead mechanism effective within each node tests for each data block received from a link and buffered at an input port, whether it can be accepted at the appropriate output port of the same node for further transmission. A token mechanism effective over links allows to maintain at each output port of a node an indication whether any data block can be accepted in the input port at the other end of the respective link. By the combined operation of look ahead mechanisms and token mechanisms the flow of addressed messages in a direction where the transmission path is already filled up is prevented. This has a positive smoothing effect on overall traffic flow where short time or local overloads occur.
