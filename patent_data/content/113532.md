# Coupling.

## Abstract
A coupling 10 for connecting substantially identical external threaded ends 14a, 14b of tubular conduits 12a, 12b and the like in end to end relation, the coupling including a first or outer coupling member 18 having an internal chamber 22 and adapted to be threaded onto the threaded end of either of the conduits to be connected, and a second coupling member 34 disposed within the chamber in the outer coupling member and adapted for threaded engagement with the threaded end of either conduit. The first and second coupling members are adapted to be to be threaded onto a selected one of the conduits in a manner enabling an axial alignment of the conduits by relative lateral movement therebetween after which the outer coupling member is threaded onto the other of the conduits to draw the adjacent ends of the conduits into abutting end to end relation.
