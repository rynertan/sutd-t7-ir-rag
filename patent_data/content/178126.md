# Phase and amplitude control of vertical modulation in horizontal scan of CRT high resolution television.

## Abstract
In a system for high resolution television achieved by verti cal modulation of the horizontal scan at a frequency twice the color subcarrier, the modulation signal is derived from the color subcarrier at both the camera and receiver by squaring 52 the color subcarrier sinusoidal signal, inverting 54 the squared waveform, differentiating the inverted 53 and uninverted 55 square waveforms and from the combined differentiated pulses producing 56 a train of pulses at a frequency twice the color subcarrier. This train is then applied to a transistor 58 con nected as a class B amplifier with the vertical deflection coil 22 and a parallel capacitor 59 as an LC resonant load. The current to the coil is provided by a regulated power supply 60 that is adjustable to adjust the amplitude of the vertical deflec tion of the horizontal scan.
