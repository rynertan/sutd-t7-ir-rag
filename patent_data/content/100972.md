# Viewer for reading and or displaying information recorded on written or printed tape.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a viewer for reading and or displaying information recorded on written or printed tape. The viewer includes a supporting housing formed with two seats 16 for removably accommodating two motordriven rotatable spools or reels 17 , one of which carries a roll of written or printed tape material e.g. paper, wound thereon, the other being adapted to rewind the tape as it unwinds from the first reel. The tape winding unwinding on from the reels 17 is controlled by a drive circuitry for operation by the user, e.g. through a push button control 28 . Above the tape portion extending between the two reels 17 , there is arranged a magnifying lens 30 for reading the information on the tape. Advantageously, the reel accommodating seats 16 are located on a drawer structure 13 , which facilitates removal and replacement of the reels 17 . The viewer may be connected to a recorder to create an audio visual didactic aid therewith.
