# Thin film electro optic line printer.

## Abstract
A thin film light modulator 50 for use in an eiectro optic line printer 11 . A light valve utilizes a thin electro optic film 54 on a substrate 52 with the index of refraction of the film being higher than the substrate so that the light can be guided in it. A laser beam 48 is caused to be guided in the film, the beam expanding sideways so that a sheet of collimated light is provided. This light is guided beneath an array of electrodes 58 , consisting of an extended set of individually addressed metal fingers. The light diffracted by the electrode set is reimaged onto the recording medium 14 , with the zero order diffracted light blocked out, so that each electrode pair acts as a light modulator for one picture element on the output. Alternatively, the zero order is rem aged and the higher order diffraction components are blocked out. By applying each bit of a serial stream of data to the corresponding electrode, a line recording is achieved.
