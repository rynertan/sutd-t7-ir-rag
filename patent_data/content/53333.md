# Process for the production of pre foamed particles of polypropylene resin.

## Abstract
Substantially non crosslinked pre foamed particles of a polypropylene resin, characterized by the fact that they are composed of an ethylene propylene random copolymer or a mixture of an ethylene propylene random copolymer with low density polyethylene and or an ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer as a base resin and a process for producing pre foamed particles of a polypropylene resin, by impregnating substantially non crosslinked particles in an aqueous dispersion with a blowing agent in a closed heated vessel, followed by pressure release.
