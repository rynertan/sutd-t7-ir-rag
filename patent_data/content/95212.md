# Method of forming a resist mask resistant to plasma etching.

## Abstract
A mask which is resistant to a plasma etching treatment is formed by lithographically patterning a radiation sensitive resist film 3 present on a substrate 1 . The etch resistance of the mask is enhanced by exposure to a carbon monoxide plasma which forms a region 4 with an enhanced etch resistance at the surface of the patterned film. This method may be used for example to manufacture a photomask using a chromium coated glass substrate, or during the manufac ture of semiconductor devices on a semiconductor wafer substrate 1 .
