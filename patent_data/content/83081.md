# Label peeling device.

## Abstract
Herein disclosed is a label peeling device for use with a label issuing machine such as a hand labeler or a measuring printer. The label peeling device comprises a fed unit for feeding a label web 1 which has a plurality of labels temporarily adhered in series to web shaped backing paper 2 . Further comprised is a peeling unit for turning exclusively the backing paper of the label web, which is fed by the feed unit, so that the labels may be peeled one by one from their backing paper by their own rigidity. An auxiliary peeling member 33 is arranged in the vicinity of the peeling unit. This auxiliary peeling member has a label abutment portion 33a so shaped and sized that even the label, which might otherwise fail to be peeled off merely by the turn of the backing paper 2 at that particular vicinity, is brought into abutment against the label abutment portion until is is forcibly peeled from the backing paper. In a preferred embodiment the auxiliary peeling member is made rotatable in the advancing direction of the labels.
