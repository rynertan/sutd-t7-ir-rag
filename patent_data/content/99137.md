# Vibration absorbing article made of shape memory alloy.

## Abstract
The invention relates to an article with vibration damp ing capacity and includes a metal alloy with potential shape memory properties whereby the alloy is in the martensitic state at room temperature or above and absorbs in this state in a durable way at least 10 percent of the imposed vibration energy with a vibration amplitude greater than 10 ‚Åµ and smaller than the limit of microplastic deformation.
