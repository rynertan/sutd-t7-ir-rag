# Supported catalyst for polymerization of olefins.

## Abstract
An unmilled catalytic component for polymerizing olefins with high activity to yield polymers with high stereoregularity and a narrow particle size distribution with a low weight per centage of small particles comprises a solid, unmilled support containing magnesium halogen bonds, a transition metal ha lide of a metal selected from Groups IVB and VB of the periodic table, and electron donors. This catalytic component is obtained by steps compris ing a contacting a Mg OR ₂ and or Mn OR ₂ compound with a Ti OR ₄ compound to comprise a liquid, where R is a hy drocarbyl or halogenated hydrocarbyl moiety containing 1 to 20 carbon atoms or a halogen, b reacting the liquid with a fluid comprising a halogenat ing agent and treatment with an electron donor to form a treat ed solid, and c post treating the solid with a transition metal halide.
