## Description
INTERACTIVE DISPLAY SYSTEMTECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention concerns interactive display systems systems whereby a user can interact directly with a display by touching a chosen point on the screen of the display with a probe, in order to identify, select, or modify, features depicted on the screen of the display.BACKGROUND ARTVarious interactive display systems using potentiometric techniques for probe position measurement have been disclosed. One such system is described in the specification of US Patent No 4,253,737. This system encorporates a resistive polymer mesh stretched over the surface of the screen of the display. This is used in conjunction with a probe.The latter serves to measure the potential of an electric field at the point of probe contact with the mesh, a potential directly related to the distance from one edge of the mesh. The mesh is energised electrically, alternately in horizontal and vertical directions, and potentials picked up at the point touched, are converted to an output form indicative of the ordinate and abscissa of the probe position.Since the ordinate and abscissa of probe position are determined by consecutive measurement, relatively fast circuitry is required for the successive energisation of the mesh in order that no appreciable error results from movements of the probe.Furthermore, the use of the mesh overlay is best suited to light emitting displays eg. cathode ray tube CRT displays, gas plasma or electroluminescent displays, etc, for here, although optical attenuation by the mesh is appreciable, the attenuation may actually enhance the contrast of the display.However, unless an exceptionally transparent mesh is used, attenuation by the mesh can make non emissive display such as for liquid crystal or electrochromic devices unacceptably dim.Care also must be taken in aligning and mounting the mesh adjacent to the screen Errors between probe position co ordinates and the corresponding screen address co ordinates can arise due to misalignment. Errors can also arise corresponding to differential expansion or contraction of the mesh relative to the screen, particularly if the display is operated over a wide range of ambient conditions.In addition, separate signal sources generally are required for probe position measurement and for operation of the display itself.DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTIONThe invention disclosed herein is intended to provide simultaneous measurement of probe position ordinate and abscissa. This obviates the need for relatively fast energisation circuity, allowing lattitude in the choice of circuit design.Other and various advantages, as found for various embodiments of this invention, will be described in the text that follows.In accordance with the invention, there is provided an interactive display system comprising an electrically addressable display having a front screen resistive means adjacent to and extending across the front surface of this screen an electrical source connected to the resistive means for applying energisation signals thereto and sensing means, including a probe and probe circuit, responsive to the level of signal sensed, when the probe is applied to the resistive means adjacent to the screen of the display the display being characterised in that the resistive means is of partitioned structure, being comprised of a plurality of like electrodes, each a track of transparent resistive material the source is such as to provide a set of distinguishable energisation signals, and is connected to apply a different signal to each electrode and the sensing means includes probe circuitry for identifying different sensed signals, and, for determining the ordinate and abscissa of probe position from the level and identify found for each sensed signal. whilst the resistive means may be formed upon a separable screen overlay, there is particular advantage in forming the resistive means as an integral part of the screen itself. This obviates the problems of overlay alignment and distortion. This integration is particularly important where the display provided is non emissive, as is the case for liquid crystal panel displays. Since here an overlay is not used, the attenuation of light can be much reduced, and spurious internal reflections can be minimised.Each electrode track may make but a single traverse of the screen.Each track then corresponds to a single co ordinate value and there is a unique correspondance between that co ordinate and the identity of the signal sensed. Only simple processing circuitry is then required to determine the probe position ordinate or abscissa.Alternatively, each electrode track may have a folded configuration, each therefore making several traverses of the screen. This can be of advantage in large or high resolution displays, for this allows reduction of the number of electrodes without any loss in resolution, and requires fewer connections to source. Each track, however, then corresponds to several co ordinates the correspondence between signal identity and co ordinate is not unique. Co ordinate determination here requires not only the identification of the sensed signal, but also the measurement of signal level in order to resolve this ambiguity processing circuitry is therefore required.It is preferable to use as source one providing a set of common level signals. The sensed signal level, either a current or voltage level, then depends only on track resistivity and probe position and is independent of the signal identity. This affords simplification in the design of the source and of the processing circuitry.The energising signals may be distinguished, for example, by frequency, by phase, or by waveform. Thus, for example, the signals may constitute a set of repetitive phase delayed monopulse signals and these may be identified using a timing circuit. Alternatively, the signals could be members of an isogonal set eg. Walsh function waveform signals or pseudo random binary sequence coded signals. The latter coded signals could be identified using multi channel correlation, or in preference to this, by timing the incidence of the longest run of binary O s or l s occurring in each code, or by evaluating the binary number consisting of the first N bits of the waveform, when N is the number of isogonal signals in the set.The system may incorporate a matrix addressed liquid crystal panel display examples being a time multiplexed display, a waveformidentity addressed radar, oscilloscope or analogue meter display, or a liquid crystal mediumron silicon integrated display. With appropriate choice of the number, configuration, and dimensions of the electrodes, this can be achieved with a resolution identical to that of the display itself.The system may incorporate a cathode ray tube CRT display. The determination of probe position is independent of the persistence of the phosphor and is possible whether the screen is glowing or not. Thus, in distinction to light pen systems, it can be used with long persistence phosphors and with vector addressed CRT s.It is particularly advantageous to use a combination of display and probe circuit that permits use of signals in common for display address and for electrode energisation for then a single source may be provided with substantial saving in circuitry. Thus, for example, it is possible to combine an isogonal signal addressed display eg an oscilloscope display as described in UK Pat. No. 2001 794 and a probe circuit including circuitry capable of identifying the different isogonal signals. In this case it is convenient to have electrodes in equal number, orientation and in register each side of the front screen, these electrodes extending to the periphery of the screen where they can be connected in pairs each by different common connection to the source.Where time variant energising signals are employed, direct contact between the probe and the resistive means is not essential. The coupling may be capacitative and aroteetive layer of dielectric material for example, a thin film of titanium dioxide may be applied over the front surface of the electrodes. The system can therefore be made relatively durable.A high resistive voltage probe eg an FET probe may be used. In this case the electrodes may be connected to a common earth at their ends remote from the source connection. Signal level is here a potential.Alternatively, a low resistance current probe may be used. In this case the electrodes may be open circuit at their ends remote from the source connection. The signal level here is then a current level, or, if a drop impedance is used, a corresponding voltage level. This alternative is less favoured however, as contact resistances are liable to vary and introduce indeterminate error.In utilisation of the display systems aforementioned, problems may arise in the event of poor contact made between the probe and the resistive means, or of poor positioning of the probe relative to the resistive electrodes it may for example be positioned where it straddles adjacent electrodes in each case leading to a false reading of co ordinates. Test circuits may be included i to test valid contact of the probe ii to provide self calibration, to correct for contact impedance of the probe iii to test frame rate of the detected waveform, to verify that the detected data is valid and or, iv to test amplitude of successive detected pulses, likewise to verify that the detected data is valid.Accordingly, there is further provided a test circuit comprising switch means connected to each of the electrodes control means, co operative with the switch means, for controlling switching of the electrodes between a floating condition and a current carrying condition and, comparator means, co operative with the probe, for comparing probe output for the floating condition a test output, against a preset reference voltage, and also co operative with the control means to switch the electrodes to the current carrying condition whensoever the test output exceeds the preset voltage, to enable co ordinate measurement.The switch means end control means may comprise an assembly of diodes, and a common controllable diode bias source, respectively. In utilisation of the above test circuit, co ordinate measurement is only enabled when the probe test output exceeds a preset value. At other times, when the probe contact is too poor to provide probe test output of sufficient value, co ordinate measurement is disabled, so false measurement is avoided.Improvementof co ordinate resolution may be introduced by providing, in addition to the test circuit aforesaid, a scaling circuit comprising store means, co operative with the probe, for holding the test output thereof and, scaling means, co operative with both the probe and the store means, for scaling the measurement output of the probe, or a signal derivative thereof, by a scale factor determined in accordance with the held value of the test output, to afford thereby self calibrating correction.Details of data validation circuits are also given in the description that follows.BRIEF INTRODUCTION OF THE DRAWINGSIn the drawings accompanying this specification Figure 1 is an illustrative drawing of an interactive display system embodying the features of this invention Figure 2 is a diagram showing a source for providing the different signals used in the operation of the system shown in the preceding figure and, Figure 3 is a diagram showing a configuration of solded elec trodes that may be incorporated in an alternative display system.

This system 1 comprises a liquid crystal panel display 3, the front screen of which, a glass substrate 5, is shown. Resistive means is provided by a layer 7 of transparent resistive material, thin film indium tin oxide, deposited uniformly over the surface of the screen 5. The layer 7 has been partitioned by a conventional photo lithographic definition and etch process and is comprised of a plurality of like electrodes 9, tracks which extend across the screen 5 from one side to the other.One end of each electrode 9 is connected to a signal source 11 by an edge connector 13. The other end of each electrode 9 is connected toEarth via a second edge connector 15. When signal is applied to each electrode 9 a potential gradient is developed, the potential at any point along each electrode track 9 is linearly dependent on the distance x from the edge of the screen 5.The system 1 includes sensing means, ie an FET probe 17 and probe circuit 19. The operator interacts with the display 3 by placing the probe 17 in contact with the resistive means 7 at a chosen position on the screen 5. When the probe 17 comes into contact with one of the electrodes 9, the signal that is applied to this electrode 9 is sensed and the output signal developed by this probe 17 is processed in the probe circuit 19 by an analogue to digital converter 21. This latter converts the analogue output signal into digitised form and the digitised output developed is stored in a first latch 23. The digital code stored in this latch 23 serves as a measure of the x coordinate, the abscissa of the probe position.The components of the source 11 are shown in figure 2. This source 11 comprises a shift register 25 an array of AND gates 27 connected to the output channels of this register 25 and a square waveform generator 29 connected to the inputs of the AND gates 27. This source 11 provides a set of distinguishable signals, a different signal at the output of each AND gate 27. Each signal has the form of a pulse modulated AC square wave, and since it is truly alternating is also suitable for addressing the LCD display 3 itself. These signals all differ in phase.The probe circuit 19 also includes circuitry for identifying the sensed signal. The output of the probe 17 is connected to a complementary pair of comparators 31 and 33 and an OR gate 35. These respond to signal pulses and the output signal from the OR gate 35 is used to halt the counting cycle of a counter 37. This counter is set by clock pulses from a clock oscillator 39, which also serves the source 11. The output of the counter 37, which depends on the signal phase, provides a measure of the y co ordinate, the ordinate of the probe position. This output is stored in a second latch 41. Latch output is synchronised by connecting the first latch 23 to the output of theOR gate 35. To ensure that the resolution of the interactive part of the system 1 is the same as that of the display itself, theenergised electrodes 9 and the address electrodes not shown of the display 3, located on the reverse side of the screen substrate 5, are matched in number, dimension and alignment. During fabrication the two sets of electrodes are formed in register with each other. Where the source signals are utilised for energisation and for address, the registered electrodes may be connected in pairs by common connections in the first edge connector 13.An alternative electrode configuration is shown in figure 3. Here the resistive means 7 is formed on the surface of the screen faceplate 5 of a CRT display 3 . It has been partitioned to define a plurality of folded electrode tracks 9 . Each electrode 9 has several connected parallel limbs, each of which extends across the screen 5 from one side to the other. This folded configuration allows reduction in the number of different signals and number of source connections required. The source and probe circuitry employed is similar to that already described figures 1 2 , but since in this example the position co ordinates are no longer uniquely defined by either the sensed signal level or signal phase alone, additional processing circuitry is included to convert raw data from the convertor 21 and from the counter 37 to co ordinate form. The algorithms used in this conversion are given below x s 1 xO entier r yO y y0rem r yO where x is the abscissa of the probe position the is the width of screen occupied by each folded electrode y is the ordinate of the probe position yO is the length of each limb of the electrodes r is the distance of the probe from one end of the electrode, and is determined by measurement of the signal potential s is the number of the electrode counted from one edge of the screen, and is determined by measurement of the signal phase and, the functions entier ray and rem r yO are the integer part and remainder of the variable r yO, respectively.In the above systems, false measurement may result in the event of poor probe contact or poor positioning of the probe relative to the electrodes. A test circuit figure 4 is thus provided to inhibit measurement in such event. In this circuit the resistive electrodes 9 are connected to a common line 51 by switches, an assembly of diodes 53. The probe 17, a high impedance FET voltage probe, is connected via a buffer amplifier 17A to an analogue comparator 55, where the probe output is compared with a preset reference voltage. Diode switching is controlled by a bistable flip flop 57 which is interposed between the output of the comparator 55 and the common line 51. A first AND gate 59 is included between the output of the comparator 55 and the control input of the bistable 57, for timing control. The bistable 57 also serves to control operation of a first sample andhold store 61 and is connected to it via a second AND gate 63. This first sample and hold store 61 is connected to the output of the buffer amplifier 17A and serves to hold the measurement output of the probe 17.Scaling circuit components a second sample and hold store 65, and, a controlling delay monostable 67, are also shown in figure 4. This second sample and hold store 65 serves to hold the test output of the probe 17. The derivative signal outputs of the two stores 61 65 are relayed to an A D converter 21, where scaling and signal measurement is performed.Referring to the circuit of figure 4 and the tuning diagram figure 5, the action is as follows A logic 1 is clocked through the shift register 25 which successively applies a voltage pulse to each electrode 9 in turn. The 4 output of the flip flop 57 is high so the diodes 53, in series with each of the electrodes 9, are biased off. As no current flows, the amplitude of the pulses, at all points along each electrode 9, are the same making it possible to test for good probe contact.The pulse detected by the probe 17 is compared by the analogue comer parator 55 with the preset voltage. This voltage determines the minimum pulse amplitude the circuit will accept.When a good contact is made by the probe 17 on one of the electrodes 9, the amplitude of the pulse will be large enough to cause the comparator output to change state. The first AND gate 59 is enabled and allows a clock pulse through to clock the flip flop 57. This causes the Q output to go low which allows the diodes 53 to conduct and current to flow along the electrodes. At the same instant the flip flop Q output goes high enabling the second AND gate 63 which allows a strobe pulse through to the first sample and hold store 61 which acquires and holds the potentially divided measurement voltage sensed by the probe 17.For high resolution systems it is not possible to set the comparator reference voltage accurately enough to discriminate down to a one pixel error in probe signal voltage. The second sample and hold store 65 is arranged to acquire the probe voltage during the initial period of the pulse. This test voltage is stored in the second sampleand hold store 65 and is used as the scale reference voltage for theA D converter 21. This has the effect of scaling the converter by the required amount to compensate for small variations in probe contact efficiency.When the probe is not coupled to an electrode the probe input impedance is very high which makes the circuit vulnerable to external electrical interference. To combat this, the data validation circuits of figure 6 and figure 7 are included. A second shift register 69 is used to delay the Q output of the bistable flip flop 57 by a time equal to that occurring between electrode drive pulses. The circuit is so arranged that the start pulse used to initiate the A D converter is only passed when the output of this shift register 69 coincides with its input referred to a following AND gate 71. This can only happen if two pulses of the correct repitition rate are received, thus single or spurious trains of pulses are ignored.In figure 7 data held in the A D converter 21, is compared by a digital comparator 73 with previous data held in a first latch 75. Only when these two are equal is new data transferred to a final latch 77. Two successive readings of the same amplitude are required for the output to change.The shift register 25 shown in figure 4, may be replaced by the reference waveform drivers of the display. These waveforms may alternate in polarity, as eg. the monopulse strobes shown in figure 2.However, the comparator 55 used in the way shown in figure 4 causes the circuitry to ignore negative polarity pulses on the electrodes 9.Thus the circuitry shown in figure 4 may be used essentially unaltered, although the alternations in polarity must be taken into account in the circuit timings. If the reference waveforms used to drive the display are pseudo random binary sequence codes, additional circuitry shown in figure 8 is inserted immediately after the comparator 55 to detect the longest run of binary l s and to output a single pulse which initiates measurement action during the last 1 of the run. This sub circuit comprises a further shift register 79 and a multiple inputAND gate 81.APPLICATIONThe invention described may be used with multiplexed dot matrix liquid crystal devices, waveform identity addressed oscilloscope and radar liquid crystal device displays and control panels, with back projection displays for example laser written smectic displays as also with cathode ray tube displays, especially those with long persistance phosphors or using vector mode address.
