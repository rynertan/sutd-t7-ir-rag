## Description
The present invention relates to 3 aza 7 hydroxy 2,2,4,4 tetraalkylbicyclo 3.3.0 octanes, compounds useful as antioxidizers for polyolephins. It relates moreover to the carbonyl derivatives, used as the intermediates in the preparation of the said stabilizers. It is known that the polyolephins, in particular polypropylene and polyethylene, undergo degradation with time, e.g., due to the exposure to the atmospheric agents, and to the consequent oxidation by the atmospheric oxygen. Each degradation becomes evident as a loss of some physical characteristics of the polymers, such as e.g., a decrease in ultimate tensile strength, and a loss of flexibility. The decrease of the above indicated characteristics can be evaluated quantitatively by means of the measurement of the melt flow index of the polymers MFI . An excessive increase in MFI denotes a severe breakdown of the polymer. To the purpose of preventing such a breakdown, resort has been had to the addition of some amounts of stabilizer compounds to the polymers, of course caring that such compounds are not such as to alter the other characteristics of the polymers. Polyolephinic compositions stabilized against the atmospheric agents are known. The U.S. Pat. N However, the presently known stabilizer agents, although they guarantee to the polymer the effects for which they are recommended, must sometimes be added to the same polymer in rather high amounts, or they are to be prepared according to techniques not always easily accomplishable. We have now found, that is the object of the present invention, a new class of compounds showing outstanding characteristics as antioxidizers for the plastic materials, combined with such structural characteristics as to allow particularly satisfactory applicative characteristics to be achieved. Such compounds are obtained by starting from carbonyl derivatives, which are the products corresponding to the condensation of a cyclopentenonic ring with a pyrrolidinic ring, being in their turn the second object of the present invention, through a series of reactions of easy and immediate accomplishment. The compounds being the object of the present invention, useful as antioxidizers for polyolephins, are 3 aza 7 hydroxy 2,2,4,4 tetraalkylbicyclo 3.3.0 octanes of formula The said compounds are obtained by means of the hydrogenation, in particular on Raney nickel, of carbonyl derivatives, which are products corresponding to the condensation of a cyclopentenonic ring with a sterically hindered pyrrolidinic ring, and having the following general formula Such carbonyl derivatives are obtained by means of a process, which is a third object of the present invention, consisting in reacting acetylenic compounds of formula In an alternative embodiment, instead of the alkoxide, hydroxide alcohol may be used. The reaction is carried out under extremely mild conditions, simply by dissolving the diacetylenic amine and the alkoxide or the hydroxide in a suitable solvent, in amine alkoxide or hydroxide molar ratios of from 0.1 1 to 1 0.1, in the presence of a catalyst as defined above, under stirring at room temperature 10 50 C , under a carbon monoxide atmosphere. The absorption of this latter can be easily monitored, and the reaction is considered as ended when the absorption ceases at that time, the separation of the products can be carried out, according to conventional techniques. In particular, it can be filtered off the catalyst, which can be used again for further cycles, and thereafter the solvent and then the product can be distilled off. The product is generally separated at a good purity level. As briefly outlined, the reaction is carried out in the presence of a solvent. In case R In case R The so obtained carbonyl compounds must be submitted then to hydrogenation for the preparation of the alcohols, antioxidizers for plastic materials, being the main object of the present invention. Such a hydrogenation, which comprises also the hydrogenolysis of the alkoxy group, is preferably carried out by using hydrogen over Raney nickel.
