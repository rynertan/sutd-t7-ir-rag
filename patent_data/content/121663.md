# Apparatus for opposing deformity, displacement, and expulsion of the ocular tissues during open eye surgery.

## Abstract
Deformity, displacement and expulsion of the ocular tissues during eye surgery of the type in which there is a cut through the ocular wall, is opposed by the method and apparatus of this invention. According to the invention, the external surface of the eye is divided into two areas by defining a line on the external eye wall that forms a closed loop surrounding the sites where incisions through the eye wall are to be made or where cuts through the eye wall have already been made by traumatic injury. Then, according to the invention, air pressure higher than atmospheric is generated, when needed, in a work space outside the eye adjacent to that part of the external eye wall that lies within the closed loop, without compressing the external surfaces of the eye that lie outside the closed loop. The eye is concur rently stabilized against the applied pressure by attachment to a fixation device, usually at points along the line between the pressurized and non pressurized zones of the external eye wall. In the presence of a cut through the eye wall, pressure above atmospheric in the work space is trans mitted to the interior of the eye via the cut. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, part of the wall of a hermetically closed chamber consists of a flexible drape. An aperture is formed in the flexible drape. The edges of the aperture in the flexible drape are attached to a rigid ring which has been sewn to the eye wall so as to surround the sites of the incisions to be made or the sites of traumatic injury cuts that are already present when sur gery is begun. The ring has projections that pass between the drape and the eye. The ring, when attached to the eye and immobilized by its support arm, stabilizes the eye against the applied pressure, and prevents the forces generated by the apparatus from resulting in identation or compression of the external surfaces of the eye that lie outside the circle of the ring. The pressure in the chamber can be regulated by the surgeon in keeping with the needs of the surgical situation. In particular, a pressure corre sponding to a normal intraocular pressure can be main tained during the surgery.
