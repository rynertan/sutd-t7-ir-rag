# Apparatus for clamping insulative material.

## Abstract
An electrostatic field equal to or greater than a predeter mined magnitude is established between the ends of a multiplicity of conductive bristles 54 and a stationary conductive reference surface 44 spaced from the end of the bristles for the purpose of rapidly arresting and or prevent ing movement of insulative material having a portion thereof located in the electrostatic field established between the bristle ends and the reference surface.
