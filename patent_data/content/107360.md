# Apparatus for uniformly applying either liquid or foam compositions to a moving web.

## Abstract
An elongated manifold 16 is supplied with either foam or liquid under pressure through a plurality of inlet ports spaced along the manifold. The manifold contacts a curved blade 20 along a line substantially parallel to, and below the elevation of, the crest of a horizontally disposed curved blade. The manifold is provided with outlet means 28 above the line of contact whereby foam or liquid discharged from the manifold builds up behind the blade s crest until it overflows the crest to flow as a uniform film onto a web moving past an edge of the blade.
