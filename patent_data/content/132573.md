# CLIP CIRCUIT OF CRT DISPLAY UNITS

## Abstract
A clip circuit 17 of a CRT display unit clips off, by means of a simple operation, the portion of a polygon 5 protruding from the three dimensional space 4 when the polygon 5 is partially inserted into the three dimensional space. More specifically, a window register 175 stores therein the data on the primary to tertiary planes forming the three dimensional space, respectively comprised of a pair of planes. A host computer 10 provides three dimensional coordinate data representing the respective vertexes of the polygon. An ALU 177 first extracts from the vectors constituting the polygon, a line segment existing in a field bounded by a pair of primary planes, according to the three dimensional coordinate data from the window register and the three dimensional plane data from the host computer. Then, from the above stated line segment, the ALU 177 extracts a line segment existing in a field bounded by a pair of secondary planes and further extracts from this line segment, a line segment existing in a field bounded by a pair of tertiary planes, so that the other portions excluding the extracted line segments are clipped off. Accordingly, the unnecessary portions of a polygon can be clipped off only by one processing operation for each pair of primary to tertiaty planes, which means that only three processing operations are required.
