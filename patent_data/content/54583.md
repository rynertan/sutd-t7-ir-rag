# Method of transmitting binary data sequences and arrangement for enabling the rapid determination of the end of a transmitted binary data sequence.

## Abstract
A communication method and arrangement are disclosed which provide, for a trellis encoding process in the transmitter and a maximum likelihood decoding process in the receiver, an additional fifth state ZS in addition to the usual four coding states S0...S3 . Said fifth state is entered in the transmitter at the end of transmission when a particularly selected escape symbol from a set of four escape symbols E0...E3 each associated to one of the four normal coding states is sent by an encoder supplement 15 . In the receiver, a stop signal indicating end of transmission is only generated when after the usual decoder delay a path decoder 63 determines that an escape symbol was received, and a trellis decoder 61 indicates the fifth state ZS to be the most probable one. This enables rapid and secure determination of the end of a transmitted sequence without the need for additional transmission symbols or decoder cycles.
