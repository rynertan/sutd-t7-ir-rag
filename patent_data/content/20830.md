## Description
The advent of computers in recent years gave rise to the development of what is known as access flooring.Such flooring comprised a modular embodiment of rigid structural floor panels supported on pedestal columns and frequently requiring beam like stringer members spanned between said columns for edge reinforcement. Typical assemblies were installed on top of a supporting subfloor, thus providing an adequate and secluded space to accommodate an array of power cables and the like beneath the readily accessible floor panels. This underfloor space or cavity also serves well as a distributions plenum for conditioned air. Change in location and frequent servicing of computerised equipment in an access floor environment requires repetitive physical handling of the interconnecting cables and is accomplished quite easily by the temporary removal of such modular panels.Subsequently, the underfloor cavity is exposed for complete freedom to perform any task within the maze of previously hidden wiring.When such work is finished, the modular panels fit quickly and easily back into their original position, thereby returning the area to a totally unobstructed and uniform top floor surface. In view of the weight of computers and other equipment, it was essential that the modular floor panels be substantially rigid, such that when loaded they do not appreciably allow flexure or retain permanent set once flexed, so that the access floor is uniformly flat and all panels are in a common plane. To accomplish this, some of the earlier panels were made of substantially reinforced metal encased wood and heavy metalic castings but this has been appreciably abandoned in favour of lighter weight, high strength metal sandwich panels of which the panel comprising the subject matter of U.S. Patent No. 3 236 018, to Graham et al. dated February 22, 1966, is an example which is popular, is still being produced and is used extensively in the industry. In recent years, the access flooring industry has expanded in two ways. The first is in the field of high performance, heavy duty panels for specific heavy load areas above and beyond standard computer room criteria.Secondly, the access floor industry has been expanding more and more into office renovation and general office construction for new buildings and other typical lighter load applications. A dramatic shift in the performance requirements for this type of general construction floor has substantially taken place. Current art has attemped to economically satisfy this need by means of altering panel designs by varying material thicknesses, but sometimes by discarding the standard stringer support provided at the panel edge.Although this readily achieves a lighter weight and more economical product, it inherently introduces an objectionable deficiency, namely, edge to edge movement, in the character of the system as viewed by architects and users who aret foremost aesthetically minded. Another prominent objection is related to the feel of springiness within a light weight floor under normal foot traffic. Insecure feelings also arise due to the visible edge to edge movement between panels under light equipment use.Although the structural integrity, specifically the ultimate strength, more than satisfies the most stringent general office construction criteria, this objectionable panel topanel motion is a restricting factor to the growth and acceptance of the product in the general construction and renovation market. The industry, to satisfy this need, has developed systems which reduce perimeter movement by adding secondary structures, such as perimeter stringers or complex panelto panel hard connecting devices. Although such structures tend to reduce edge to edge movement, they directly affect the accessability and ease of handling the floor system as originally conceived. Additionally, in renovations and, more importantly, in general office construction, it is desirable to hold the finished floor height of the access floor to a minimum while providing an adequate space or cavity for underfloor cables and to perform as an air distribution plenum. Thicker panels diminish vital underfloor clearance or floor toceiling height. The thickness of the access floor panel is often as much as one third of the total of this low finished floor height therefore, an economical panel with needed structural properties, yet thinner in depth, is an advancement in the art and a savings in total building height and cost for new construction, and also provides the ability to maintain adequate minimum floor to ceiling height in renovations. To do this, the structural efficiency of the panel has to be dramatically increased over existing art, especially at the perimeter. Since the development of the aforementioned patented panel, efforts have been made to simplify and also reduce the weight and the amount of metal required in said panels, without reducing, but instead, striving to increase the resistance of the panels to flexure and or permanent set, especially at the panel perimeter when subjected to static or moving loads. This has resulted in explorations and development, especially in the design, of the structural member which is primarily the lower stress member in a metal sandwich type floor panel in which it is able to perform integrally with the upper planar member upon which the load is usually imposed. In such exploration, we have determined that a key factor to resistance to flexure is the reduction of clear straight lines of vision through said sandwich panel and, more importantly, the repeated blockage in all directions within the sandwich. It has been found that several patterns of projections with common strategic dimensional relationships can provide both necessary blockage of clear lines of vision and suitable support of the top sheet to resist localised indentation of the access floor panel.Projections were selected because they combined the benefits of a continuous bottom member with the support obtained from arch shaped projections to prevent collapse thereof, together with an optimum depth which, combined with the structural and economic efficiency of the section, developed blockage of n see through , thereby providing sufficient section properties to resist deflection by the loads applied. The strategic dimensional relationship is a combination of considerations of five major characteristics of the projections and their interrelation namely 1 depth of projections for needed section modulus and moment of inertia 2 diameter of projections to obtain their their needed depth 3 distance between the centrelines of projections for sufficient top sheet support 4 strategic positioning of projections to repeatedly block clear lines of vision throughout the member and 5 remaining bottom surface material adequate to perform as a stress member and also develop necessary section modulus and moment of inertia. Prior art has failed to combine and or incorporate one or more of these five structurally significant characteristics and has, therefore accomplished a less than optimum one piece structural member which, when combined with a top sheet, does not provide an economical metal sandwich construction Of desired comparable strengthto weight ratio or structural efficiency. It has been found that specific patterns of several different embodiments of projections, in which at least the major portions of the configuration of said projections are circular and details of which are described fully hereinafter, results in increased rigidity and resistance to flexure to a marked extent. Said projections are formed in sheets of planar industrial material of lighter gauge than now employed in the floor panel of the type shown in said aforementioned Patent No. 3 236 018 for improved performance under the same load conditions.The efficiency in performance of the developed core structure has thus been dramatically improved. Such characteristics and features are not found in the prior art, notwithstanding the disclosure of formed sheets having various types of projecting ribs and or figures of a regular contour pressed from planar sheets and other means which block straight lines of sight across the formed sheet and through such ribs and figures, either because the configurations do not permit sufficient depth of section for strength purposes, are not sufficiently conducive to resist flexure under the required loads existing in access floor use, or are not economical to competively market the same. The prime object of this invention is to form, within a single sheet, a structurally efficient combination core and bottom stress member which when affixed to a planar top member surpasses the combined strength, rigidity, and economics of prior art. One of the principal objects of the invention is to provide a one piece rigid structural member capable of resistance to flexure by the formation of a sheet.of structural material to include a plurality of dome like projections which extend from the original plane of the sheet and in which at least the major portion of the configuration of each projection is circular in plan view wherein said projections are arranged in pairs connected by a saddle portion forming an elongated configuration which in plan view generally resembles a figure 8, peanut like in shape and wherein said elongated configurations are arranged in substantially perpendicular basket weave pattern having a strategic dimensional relationship between the diameter of said projections and the centreto centre distance therebetween and of which, in plan view, the end of one configuration inters its with the adjacent configurations, thereby repeatedly blocking straight lines of vision laterally in all directions across said sheet. Further, said projections which form the pair which resemble a figure 8, are arranged in said sheet in a structurally strategic geometric pattern of which rows of pairs of dome like projections are in a straight line in any direction and said rows are in a perpendicular basket weave pattern relative to each other. Said pattern repeatedly blocks straight lines of clear vision in all directions across said sheet and therefore, the occurrence of said projections in said sheet is such that the spaces between adjacent projections is inadequate to accommodate another similar projection.Said projections are spaced from each other a limited distance to provide therebetween intermediate continuous structural ribbon like stresssustaining sections of fluctuating width capable of optimising stress r esisting integrity with the same being arcuate in plan view and extending between the opposite edges of said sheet to sustain the stresses under load conditions.Such a structural member may be utilised in the manufacture of composite sections, such as access flooring, decking, or other structures which require economical high strengthto weight ratios and structural efficiency. Additionally, they can provide structural components as in the construct ion of walls and other reinforcements where the individual sheet is utilised as an intermediate core member, or by itself, as a flexure resisting component. Such one piece structural members readily satisfy demands and applications in such marketable products as roofing, decks, wall constructions and a variety of other applications to provide structural efficiency. An additional object of the invention is to maintain said arcuate structural ribbon like stress sections in their original shape under stress by the circular configuration of said projections converting load stresses, which would tend to straighten said sections, into hoop stresses around said projections, thereby resisting said tendency to straighten said sections. A further object of the invention is to isolate any reduction in material thickness to substantially within the formed area of the configurations themselves.This leaves optimum material in the stress sustaining sections located where maximum section properties can be developed. A further object of the invention is to provide repeated blockage of clear lines of sight across said sheet in all directions. This is accomplished by several embodiments of patterns of projections, which are paired to form the elongated configuration, such as when the projections formed in a sheet of material are combined in groups of four and arranged in a rhombus pattern of a structurally. strategic dimensional relationship between the diameter of said projections and the centre to centre distance therebetween, and adjacent rhomboidal patterns are positioned in a close perpendicular basket weave orientation.Said basket weave orientation in a structurally strategic geometic pattern also is produced by rows of pairs of equally spaced in line projections being interwoven perpendicularly with other such rows of pairs in a basket weave fashion, so that the portions of a centre lines of a row of pairs of projections that lies between two aligned pairs bisects the pairs thereof in transverse rows, as shown by dotted lines in Figure 8 and also provides sufficient pattern density to block straight lines of clear vision repeatedly in all directions across said sheet to form a one piece rigid structural member capable of resistance to flexure.Similarly, blocking is accomplished by arranging a plurality of configurations in close proximity to each other within the pattern in which certain of said configurations resembling a figure 8 are combined with others which are circular in cross section, at least a major portion of the circumference of all projections are circular in plan view with the combinations of said configurations and projections in said sheet being such as to repeatedly block straight lines of clear vision across said sheet. Finally, blockage is accomplished by including at least one drawn section formed from the original planar sheet in the same direction as said configurations, said drawn section having an area larger than said configurations surrounding said pattern. The arrangements of said configurations, projections and drawn section are designed so as to repeatedly block clear lines of vision across said sheet.The blocking of clear lines of sight repeatedly across said sheet provide a structural member of increased resistance to flexure due to increased structural efficiency, and when combined with a planar top sheet becomes an economical composite structural unit of substantially greater strength than one in which lines of clear vision are present around which the structural unit can be flexed. Still another object of the invention is to provide the location of said configurations and projections in such a manner that a composite unit which is resistant to flexure is substantially isotropic, whereby said unit when penetrated by an opening of limited cross section located inward from the edges is resistant to flexure due to the resulting stresses in said unit when under load being redirected around said opening. This provides a unit which can be utilised as an access floor panel or other wall panel uses in which ready penetration can be made without significant reduction in the structural integrity of the unit in order to provide penetrations for cables, pipes, or other accesses as needed in the construction industry. One further important object of the invention is to combine any of the previously described patterns of configurations and projections in a structural member with a flat sheet of structural material of similar size and shape and fixedly connect the upper ends of said projections to said flat sheet to form a composite structural panel in which said sheet of said panel is disposed uppermost in use, thereby forming load carrying composite structures usable in many industrial applications. A still further object is utilisation of this composite structural member in the fabrication of access floor panels wherein the perimeter of said structural member has the outer edge portions formed at right angles to said member to provide a continuous bracing flange around the panel of a given finite siz to provide a panel which can be selectively supported at the edges or corners thereof and which can accept substantial uniform or concentFated loads, such as those seen in access flooring applications. A still further object of the invention is to provide an integral perimeter lip bent outward from said peripheral bracing flange to provide an additional connection between said member and said top sheet which is utilised as v stiffened lip by which the access floor panel can be selectively supported at the corners or along the perimeter to develop an access floor system in combination with pedestals and or stringers. A still further object of the invention is to provide said peripheral bracing flange with a greater transverse depth relative to said intermediate portion of said structural member between said projections, and in which said depth is greater than the height of said configurations and projections and a portion extending in the opposite direction from said configurations and projections and another portion extending in the same direction as said configurations and projections to provide a perimeter of increased strength and resistance to flexure, especially when utilised as an access floor panel without the use of secondary members, such as stringers or more complicated panel to panel hard connecting devices to prevent edge to edge movement. Another object is to form said structural member in such manner that all surfaces of said configurations and projections and the junctures thereof with said intermediate structural stress sections in the original plane of said sheet are free from sharp edges or bends whereby there are no areas or portions in said sheet which comprise corners or other shapes which normally tend to pucker or otherwise resist formation of smoothly stretched areas when formed from planar sheets and subjected to shaping by dies. One further object of said invention is to provide a structural member which can be combined with a similar member and fixedly connected, end to end, to provide a composite core structure which can be utilised in industrial application, especially where high strengthto weight ratio properties are desired and which do not necessarily require a flat planar sheet. Flat planar sheets may be added to this composite structure if desired.

Figure 17 is a fragmentary sectional view as seen on line 17 17 of Figure 16. The most important part of the present invention comprises a one piece structural member formed from a sheet of industrial material which preferably comprises metal, such as steel, for example, but for certain applications of the invention, other industrial material, such as certain plastics, may be employed. Particularly when made from metal, a sheet of such industrial materials is subjected to appropriate punches and dies respectively for forming a plurality of any one of a number of different shapes, kinds, and patterns of confugurations and projections, details of which are described hereinafter, said configurations and projections preferably extending from one surface of the sheet of material and all the upper ends of said configurations and projections preferably being substantially within the same plane.Except for the integral edge construction which may be formed simultaneously from within said sheet, all surfaces of the major portion of the sheet are smoothly curved and are free from sharp angles or bends which otherwise would comprise corners or other shapes which normally tend to pucker or resist formation of smoothly stretched areas when formed from a planar sheet and subjected to shaping by such punches and dies. Except for the possibility of forming a limited number of holes or openings in the sheet, such, as for the transmission of air in certain applications of the invention, the formed sheet is substantially imperforate. To provide an understanding of certain terms used in the specification and claims of this application, the following definitions are set forth 1. Stress section The portion of the structural member between the projections designed to withstand tensile and compressive stresses. 2. Structurally strategic geometric pattern the dimensional relationship and orientation of projections in which the following five major characteristics are strategically interrelated 1 depth of projection for needed section modulus and moment of inertia 2 diameter of projections to obtain needed depth 3 distance between the centrelines of projections for adequate top sheet support 4 strategic positioning of projections to repeatedly block clear lines of vision throughout the member 5 remaining bottom surface material adequate to perform as a stress member and also provide necessary section modulus and moment of inertia. 3. Structural unit a nut of two or more members, which when combined provide a substantial increase in section modulus and strength to weight ratio over these same properties of the individual members. 4. Substantially hemispherical dome like projections projections having radiused contours in all directions of one or a combination of radii to provide arches for top sheet support and to develop optimum height for increased section modulus. 5. Fixedly secured any means causing two members to work together as a composite unit, such as welding, riveting, use of structural adhesives, direct fusion or other known methods. 6. Optimisation of support providing specific I density of projections in a base sheet of material, such that they prevent localised indentation of the top sheet when used as a composite unit, providing frequency of load transfer from the top sheet to the structural member and minimising top sheet thickness while optimising strengthto weight ratio of the unit. 7. Straight lines of vision visible longitudinal openings providing direct open paths through a composite section around which the section can bend or flex and through a member around which the member can flex.Increased frequency of blockage is directly proportional to increased resistance to flexure. 8. Rhombus pattern geometric pattern of an equilateral parallelogram having oblique angles wherein the centres of the projections are located at corners of a rhombus. 9. Basket weave orientation the combination of patterns of pairs of projections or elongated configurations interlaced or intermeshed and in which one pattern is perpendicular to an adjacent pattern so that a straight line of sight therebetween is intercepted, thus providing a unique pattern of location and density for sufficient top sheet support and optimum strength toweight ratio. 1O.Saddle portion material unrestrained by the die during pressing, located between two dome like projections in an elongated configuration, which is unrestricted at the original plane of the member, and is naturally stretched down between the projections usually to a depth less than, but may be equal to, the depth of the projections. When depth of the saddle portion is made equal to the depth of projections as when formed with a die, the saddle portion provides additional top sheet support. 11 . Elongated configuration a combination of two or more projections with the saddle portion extending between said projections, and resembling at least a figure 8, peanut like in shape. 12.Arcuate structural stress members stress members between said projections of the sheet, sinuous in shape and held in their configuration when under stress by the circular ends of the projections acting to resist deformation and tendency to straighten. 13. Continuous bracing flange the edge termination of a member of finite size and perpendicular thereto which provides continuous built in means of edge stiffening. 14. Peripheral lip the return of the outermost edge portion of the continuous bracing flange to dispose it in the same plane as the terminal ends of said projections and when affixed to a top sheet provides a means of selectively supporting a panel at the corners and or edges thereof. 15. Greater transverse depth additional depth provided at the edge termination of a member of finite size, said depth being deeper than said projections and providing added edge stiffness. 16. Isotropic load resisting properties of a composite unit having substantially the same values when measured along axes in all directions and which is substantially free from directional weakness when the unit is penetrated by holes, cut outs, and the like. 17. Structural efficiency the efficient design and utilisation of structural components in such a way as to permit the use of shallower sections and thinner materials in lieu of deeper sections and heavier materials while developing equal or better moment of inertia and or more balanced section modulus. Relative structural efficiencies of two units expressed as a percentage, said units under the same load and support conditions is determined by the following formula Deflection Unit 1 X Mass weight Unit 1 Deflection Unit 2 Mass weight Unit 2 Section depth Unit 1 2x 100 Section depth Unit 2 1 Hoop stress tensile or compressive stress in a circular member acting circumferentially.Because of symmetry of the member, there is no tendency for any part of the circumference to depart from the circular form under load as long as the hoop stress remains below the yield point of the material. 19. Directional weakness appreciable loss of strength in a. structural unit caused by planes of flexural weakness that are developed by penetration of said structural unit and around which planes the unit readily flexes relative td flexure in other directions. 20. Strength to weight ratio ratio of the mathmatical product of deflection times mass for one unit compared to the same ratio for a second unit. The strength to weight ratio is used to determine minimum weight consistent with the geometry of the unit required to maintain the integrity of the unit to resist flexure.Relative strength to weight ratios of two units expressed as a percentage, said units being under the same load and support conditions, is determined by the following formula Deflection Unit 1 Mass weight Unit 1 X X 100 Deflection Unit 2 Mass weight Unit 2 Referring to Figure 1, there is shown therein a fragmentary section of a sheet 10 of structural material, which initially is planar and the same is subjected to a set of dies to form therein a plurality of projections 12 which, as will be seen from Figures 2 and 3, are domeshaped, are substantially hemispherical in cross section, arranges in pairs and connected by a saddle portion 38 which as shown in cross section in Figures 2 and 3 does not usually project as far from the original plane of sheet 10 as the pair of projections 12.From Figure 1 it will be seen that th e resulting elongated configuration 40 in plan view closely resembles a figure 8, peanut like shape. This arrangement provides one embodiment of configurations which adapts itself to being disposed in patterns, such as shown in one examplary manner in Figure 1, in which said configurations are in close relationship to each other, the end of one configuration 40 inters its with the adjacent configurations 40, thereby repeatedly blocking straight lines of vision laterally in all directions across sheet 10.Further, said projections which form the pairs which resemble a figure 8 are arranged in said sheet in a structurally strategic geometric pattern of which rows of pairs of equallyspaced in line projections are interwoven perpendicularly in basket weave fashion, andas further illustrated diagrammatically by broken lines in Figure 8, the portions of a centreline of a row of pairs that lies between two aligned pairs bisecting the pairs thereof in rows transverse thereto. Said projections are spaced a limited distance from each other so as to provide therebetween sections of the original sheet which are arcuate as indicated by the exemplary somewhat sinuous diagrammatic line 14, which outlines the intermediate continuous planar structural ribbon like stress sections 16 of the original sheet 10. It will also be observed from Figure 1 that the projections 12 are arranged in said sheet in such manner that only a limited number, such as pairs of evenly spaced projections, are disposed in what might be considered a straight line,and, preferably, the projections are disposed in patterns in which a preferred arrangement, such as perpendicular basket weave configurátion, shown diagrammatically in Figure 8, which also constitues rhombus configurations denoted by the diagrammatic figures 18 as shown in Figure 16, which in turn, extend between the centres of the projections 12.It will also be seen that said patterns touch each other at points, whereby the illustration clearly shows the relatively saturated occurrence of the projections 12 within the sheet 10, while at the same time, permitting the occurrence of the intermediate stress sections 16 between the individual, adjacent projections 12.Most importantly, however, it will be seen that the patterns 18 of the projections 12 comprise a structurally strategic geometric pattern of a density which repeatedly blocks straight lines of clear vision in all directions across the sheet and thereby, in accordance with a major objective of the present invention, this feature provides maximum rigidity to the structural member comprising sheet 10 with the configurations 40 and projections 12 formed therein due to the inter relationship of the diamter of the projections and the centre to centre distance between adjacent projections. Another advantage of forming the projections 12 in dome like configuration of a thickness no greater than that of the original sheet is that the same are readily capable of being formed to a substantial height from the original plane of the sheet 10 in which, for example, the intermediate stress sections 16 are disposed as shown in an examplary manner in Figure 4 and also in Figure 5, whereby the uppermost portions of the projections 12 are thinner than the lower portions thereof, while the intermediate stress sections 16 preferably retain optimum material, thereby providing maximum stress resisting capabilities. Further, the formed structural member comprising the sheet 10 with the configurations 40 formed therein may be produced by a simple form die arrangement. The shape of the projections 12 also is capable of being formed without rupture or shearing and, if desired, the resulting product may be imperforate. However, particularly when the structural member is employed in either a structural unit or finished structural panel through which, for example, cable cut outs or the like are desired, the structural member per se may be provided with suitable openings of limited diameter in appropriate locations through both the intermediate stress sections 16 or the outer ends, for example, of the projections 12, when desired, without detracting from the stress resisting capabilities of the structural member, due to the isotropic properties of the unit. In most applications of the invention, the structural member comprising the sheet 10 and the configurations 40 formed therein is combined with a second planar sheet 20. Due to the fact that the upper ends of the projections 12 are substantially within a common plane, when the sheet 20 is abutted commonly with said outer ends of the projectios 12, it may be secured to said upper ends by any appropriate means, such as welding, rivets, industrial adhesives, direct fusion, or any other known means of suitable nature, by which the planar sheet 20 is fixedly connected to said projections 12.This results in producing a structural unit which finds a most useful application when formed into a composite panel, several preferred embodiments of which are illustrated fragmentarily respectively in Figures 4 and 5 in vertical section and, correspondingly, and respectively in Figures 6 and 7, in which fragmentary corners of a composite structural panel 22 of one embodiment, and a second embodiment 24 thereof, as shown in bottom plan view. To form said composite panel, the edges of a finite shape and size of the sheet 10 with the configurations therein are bent upwardly at a right angle to form a reinforcing bracing flange 26 which has the same vertical dimension as the height of the projections 12 and, additionally, in the embodiments shown in Figures 4 8, the terminal edge portion of the bracing flange 26, which is continuous around all four sides of the composite panel, is bent outwardly at a right angle thereto to form preferably a continuous lip 28, the upper surface of which is in a plane common with that of the upper ends of the projections 12, whereby the second planar sheet 20 commonly abuts the upper surface of the lip 28 and the upper ends of all of the projections 12, it being understood that the planar sheet 20 also will be of substantially the same finite shape and size as that of the embodiment of structural member 30 to which it is fixedly connected. As can be visualised from the illustration of the occurrence of the configurations 40 within the sheet 10 of the structural member 30, especially as seen from Figure 1, there is very frequent support afforded the second planar sheet 20, whereby a sheet of substantially reduced thickness may be utilised and still permit the same to afford resistance to indentation even by localised loads when applied to the planar sheet 20 of the composite structural panel 22 and the structurally strategic geometric pattern which embodies the unique relationship between the diameter of the projections and the centre to centre distance therebetween so as to provide increased resistance to deflection relative to strength to weight ratio and structural efficiency, even when subjected to substantial loads of either a unifdrm or concentrated nature. Referring to Figures 5 and 7, the composite structural panel 24 shown therein is similar to the panel shown in Figures 4 and 6, except that the bracing flange 32 thereof is of a greater depth than the height of the projections 12 of the configurations 40 and is formed by means ot depressing the peripheral sections 34 of the additional embodiment of structural member 36 from the remaining portions of the basic sheet 10 in a direction opposite to that from which the projections 12 extend, thereby producing a portion which extends oppositely to projections 12 and wherein said bracing flange 32 extends in the same direction as the projections 12 and is of greater vertical dimension than the flange 26 in the embodiment of Figure 4.The resulting composite structural panel 24, shown in Figures 5 and 7, particularly adapts this embodiment of structural panel to provide support, especially by the corners thereof. This eliminates.the need for supporting stringers between suitable pedestals, which, for example, are required in an elevated floor such as a so called access floor in which a plurality of such structural panels are employed as floor panels and, under which circumstances, many available structural panels presently in use do not have the required rigidity along the edges thereof. Notwithstanding the fact that the intermediate stress sections 16 of the embodiments of the invention shown in the foregoing figures are arcuate and somewhat sinuous in plan view, said stress sections are maintained in said configuration and are capable of not being moved therefrom when subjected to stress due to the fact that the circular configuration of the projections 12 in crosssection converts load stress to hoop stress adjacent to the opposite sides of said stress section. It is well known that a circular hoop is the strongest configuration for resisting deformation from its original shape when forces are supplied radially around the circumference thereof.As can be seen, especially from Figure 1, the arcuate intermediate stress sections 16 extend substantially around all sides of the circular projections 12 and thereby utilise the hoop stress property of such projections advantageously for the stated purpose with respect to the stress sections 16. Further, the major portion of the perimeters especially the perimeters of the opposite end portions of the configurations 40, are circular in plan view, thereby providing the aforementioned hoop stress which serves to maintain the intermediate stress sections 16. This is represented by the diagrammatic lines 14 in Figure 1 which illustrate the sinuous shape thereof even when the sheet 10 is subjected to loads. A more comprehensive concept of the several embodiments of composite panels is represented and illustrated in the several embodiments shown in the preceding figures. Attention is directed to Figure 8, in which the composite structural panels 22 and 24 are shown in bottom plan view, which correspond to the fragmentary vertical sections thereof, respectively, shown in Figures 4 and 5. Referring now to Figure leo, in which a fragmentary portion of the structural sheet 10 is specifically shown with elongated configurations 40 formed therein, the arcuate intermediate stress sections 16 may have the effectiveness thereof increased by forming in at least certain of said sections 16 an additional embossed rib 56, several of which are illustrated in an exemplary manner inFigure 10, and also in cross section in Figure 11, the latter figure being on a larger scale than that used inFigure 10. The embossed ribs 56 generally follow the shape of the arcuate, ribbon like intermediate stress sections 16. Although only a pair of the ribs 56 are shown in outline pattern in Figure 10 in intersecting relationship, it is to be understood that any desired number of such additional reinforcing ribs may be employed, as desired, especially in relation to the rigidity required, commensurate with the thickness of the sheet 10 and the shape and spacings of the projections extending therefrom. Still another embodiment of patterns of projections which may be employed in accordance with the principles of the invention is illustrated in Figures 12 and 13, in which a fragmentary section of a sheet of structural material 10 is shown, and this particular illustration embodies a mixture of different shapes of configurations and projections which are more extensively illustrated in certain of the preceding figures, and also the circular configurations 12, which similarly, are illustrated more extensively in certain of the preceding figures. In addition to these previously described configurations and projections, however, the embodiment shown in Figures 12 and 13 also include a still further projection comprising a section 58, which is drawn from the original plane of the structural sheet 10, the drawn section 58 being of the same depth with respect to sheet 10, as the configurations 40 and the projections 12, the same being surrounded in a pattern of such projections and configurations but in a manner so that the entire pattern repeatedly blocks straight lines of clear vision between any of the sides of the structural member when viewed along a plane parallel to the intermediate stress sections 16. Still another embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Figures 14 and 15 with regard both to structural members 30 and 34 and similar structural members 42 and 44, as well as to the composite structural panels 22 and 24 in which they respectively are included.This embodiment comprises terminating the bracing flanges 26 and 28 in these respective structural members and composite structural panels at the upper ends and omit the lips 28 thereon, thus butting the upper ends of the flanges directly against the adjacent surfaces of the top planar sheets 20 in said members and panels and connecting said upper ends of the flanges fixedly to the perimeters of said1 top planar sheets which also terminate at the vertical plane of the outside surfaces of said bracing flanges, as clearly shown in Figures 14 and 15. Under such circumstances, when the structural panels thus formed are used in an access floor, the outer surfaces of said bracing flanges of adjacent panels closely inters it in the overall access floor. Still a further embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Figures 16 and 17, and similarly to the embodiment illustrated in Figures 10 and 11, increases the effectiveness of the arcuate intermediate stress sections 16. Specifically, additional protrusions 60 are formed in stress sections 16 between configurations 40 and of less height than projections 12. As previously discussed in reference to Figure 8, projections 12 are positioned in a manner that form rhombus configurations denoted by diagrammatic figures 18. The additional protrusions 60 are preferably positioned in the centre of the squared areas 62 between the rhombus patterns 18 and are sized so as to retain a planar portion of each stress section 16, said portions being located between protrusions 60 and projections 12 forming the corners of the squared areas 62.The acceptance of tension and compression stresses by stress sections 16 are, therefore, substantially unaffected by the inclusion of protrusions 60 since the stresses are resisted by being distributed around the protrusions 60. At the same time, the section modulus of the Meet can be increased with an attendant gain in rigidity. The embodiment of Figures 16 and 17 can be advantageous in specialised applications requiring a small but, nevertheless increased rigidity of the embodiment ofFigure 8, but could be undesirable if the application was such that an increased section depth was undesirable.By way of emample and with reference to Figure 14, if protrustions 60 were formed in stress sections 16 and extended from the sheet in a direction opposite to the projections 12, the increased thickness of the sheet might render it undesirable in those installations requiring small clearance between sub floor and panel. From the foregoing, it will be seen that the present invention provides a plurality of embodiments of structural members and composite structural panels which include the same and in which such panels are relatively of light weight and embody optimi sat ion of support by utilising the most effective strength to weight ratio and structural efficiency and embodying maximum resistance to deflection, as well as resistance to indentation of the planar top sheet of such panels due to the frequency of structural support therefor by projections in the structural members included therein.For maximum support of the planar sheets 20 by projections 12 in the sheet 10, it will be seen in the various illustrated embodiments that additional single projectipns not comprising parts of pairs thereof or of the basket weave patterns or rhombs configurations are included in the sheets 10 and are similar to the projections in the patterns thereof to occupy areas of sheet 10 which would otherwise not offer desired support to the planar sheets 20 of the composite structurs and structural units of the invention. To demonstrate the significantly improved characteristics and performance of the present invention, comparisons have been made with access floor panels disclosed in prior art and which are commercially available.Comparisons have been made on a strength to weight basis, and a nstructural efficiency ratio basis, both described more fully below. Of existing prior art panels, there are some which have comparable resistance to flexure when loaded either at the centre of the panel and or at the midspan of the perimeter, but which require significantly greater material by weight and or depth of section. For prior art panels to have comparable performance, they would require additional material and or greater depth of section, through demonstrating lower structural efficiency which is needed to develop required moment of inertia.By combining material mass weight savings, thinner depth of section, and deflection performance, the panels of the present invention demonstrate a marked improvement in actual structural efficiency. In some instance, the improvement is in excess of 150 . Strength to weight ratio, in the context of the present invention, is used to related deflection under a given load to the mass weight of the material. Expressed as the following formula Deflection of Unit num l Mass Weight Unit X 100 x Deflection of Unit 82 Mass Weight Unit 2 the result is a numerical performance ratio, expressed as a percentage of access floor units 1 prior art to access floor unit num 2 present invention . Data employed in the formula for the present invention is an average of 3 random samples taken from a test run, and data for panels of the prior art is derived from sample panels available on the market. The structural efficiency ratio is a comparative ratio that relates deflection, mass weight, and section depth. In essence, it is a measure of the efficiency of the panel section in its utilisation of the mass of the material.

As before,t the data employed in the formula for the present invention is an average of three sample panels taken from a test run and the data for the prior art panel is derived from sample panels available on the market. The test method was identical for all panels tested. Three panels were selected at random from a test run of panels of the present invention and were tested along with commercially available sample panels available on the market. Each panel was placed on rigid pedestal supports without the use of edge stringers. Concentrated loads of identical magnitude were applied to the centre of the panel and at mid span of the perimeter. Deflection readings were recorded from the bottom of the panel directly under the load. All panels were reloaded with deflection recorded again. On each loading sequence, the permanent set was also recorded. The following chart expresses relative strengthto weight and structural efficiency ratios. The differences in these parameters are stated as a percentage improvement of the performance of panels of the present invention. Note that the present invention had performances superior to prior art panels and or panels presently available on the market. As a base, the average weight of the panels of the present invention was 20 1 4 lbs. As can be seen from the data, the present invention demonstrates a dramatic improvement in structural efficiency and strength to weight ratios over all available prior art panels and panels currently being marketed. The present invention offers a reduction in material usage over all panels to which it was compared. It provides improved resistance to flexure when loaded and utilised as an access floor panel.
