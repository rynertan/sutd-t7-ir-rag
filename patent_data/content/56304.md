# Method and apparatus for measuring the frequency response of an element or elements in a digital transmission path.

## Abstract
The invention is primarly concerned with measuring the frequency response of a regenerator in a digital trans mission system. The method and apparatus provide for a variable pulse to be inserted in a sequence of pulses re presentative of normal traffic through the system and superimposition of a sinusoidal signal on the variable pulse. Results can be plotted from passing a number of sequences through the regenerator and varying the amplitude and or frequency of the sinusoidal signal and varying the pulse.
