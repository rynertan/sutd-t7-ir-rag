# Atomic absorption spectrophotometer and method of analysis by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.

## Abstract
A method of analysis using an atomic absorption spectro photometer including a flame atomiser is disclosed which comprises the steps of a setting the parameters of the spec trophotometer to a set of preset values dependent on the sub stance to be detected, b setting the gas flow rate to the burn er to a preset value dependent on the substance to be detect ed, c aspirating an optimisation standard into the flame, d measuring the absorbance of the optimisation standard and storing the result, e modifying the gas flow rate in incremen tal steps and at each incremental step of flow rate repeating steps c and d and comprising the new absorbance value with the stored value until a maximum absorbance measurement is found, f using the maximum absorbance measurement value to select one of a plurality of sets of parameters for the spec trophotometer, and g subsequently aspirating and measur ing the absorbance of a sample using the selected set of par ameters. A first set of parameters is selected if the absorbance value is less than 0.1, the original set of parameters is retained if the absorbance value is between 0.1 and 0.5, and a third set of parameters is selected if the absorbance value is greater than 0.5. An atomic absorption spectrophotometer in which the method is automatically carried out under the control of a mi crocomputer is described.
