# Methods of preparing rigid polyurethane foams, and precursor compositions therefor.

## Abstract
This invention is directed to a process for preparing a rigid polyurethane foam which comprises reacting a poly isocyanate with polyol in the presence of a blowing agent, a polymerization catalyst and a surfactant. The polyol has the formula
