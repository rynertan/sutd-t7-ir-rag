# Apparatus for mixing one substance with another substance.

## Abstract
The invention refers to a method of mixing, for example, cytostatica stored in an ampule 1 provided with a rubber closure 8 or corresponding closure, with, for example, sterile water stored in a second ampule 2 provided with a rubber closure 12 or corresponding closure. The invention is characterized in that a first tube 7 of hypodermic needle shape, which is connected by a hose connection 6 to a first port 5 of a multi way valve 4 , is pierced through the rubber closure 8 of one ampule 1 , that a second tube 11 of hypodermic needle shape, which is connected by a hose connection 10 to a second port 9 of the multi way valve 4 , is pierced through the rubber closure 12 of said second ampule 2 . The interior of the ampules is interconnected by a hose connection 13 , the two respective ends of which have the shape of hypodermic needles 14,15 and are pierced each through one rubber closure 8,12 . A pump means in the form of a self expanding bellows 23 or hypodermic syringe 17 is connected to a third port 16 of the multi way valve 4 . By said pump means 17,23 and alternating adjustment of the multi way valve 4 , the substance in one ampule 2 is transferred to the second ampule 1 , in which the two substances are mixed with each other, and the mixture is sucked into the pump means 17,23 .
