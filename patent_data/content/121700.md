# Multiprocessor storage serialization apparatus.

## Abstract
Storage serialization apparatus in a multiprocessor computer system enables multiple processors 10, 20, 30, 40 to concurrently execute instructions which access storage 100 without materially affecting pertormance by keeping the amount of storage locked to a minimum, i.e., a page. The duration of serialization need be only for one instruction execution time and only instruction operands need be accommodated for serialization. Each storage re quest is intercepted by an associative register stack 150 where there are two registers for each operand, one of the two being for operand page crossings. After a processor has locked access to an area of storage 100 , execution of the instruction begins and all other processor are locked out but only with respect to that locked area. Other processors can access other storage areas during the instruction cycle. When the execution of the instruction completes, the processor releases the locked area of storage by invalidat ing the entries in its associative register array. A mecha nism arbitrates and breaks possible deadlocks.
