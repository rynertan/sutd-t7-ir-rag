## Description
This invention relates to novel bis triazole derivatives which have antifungal activity and are useful in the treatment of fungal infections in animals, including humans, and as agricultural fungicides. According to the invention, there are provided compounds of the formula EMI1.1 where R is phenyl optionally substituted by I to 3 substituents each independently selected from F, C1, Br, I, CF3, C1 C4 alkyl and C1 C4 alkoxy, or R is 5 chloropyrid 2 yl and R1 is H or CH and their 0 esters, 0 ethers and pharmaceutically and agriculturally acceptable salts. C3 and C4 alkyl and alkoxy groups can be straight or branched chain. The invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the formula I or an 0 ester, 0 ether or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. The invention further provides a compound of the formula I or an 0 ester, 0ether or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use in medicine, in particular for treating fungalInfections in animals, including humans. The invention yet further provides an antifungal composition for agricultural including horticultural use, comprising a compound of the formula I or an 0 ester, 0 ether or agriculturally acceptable salt thereof, together with an agriculturally acceptable diluent or carrier. The invention yet further provides a method of treating an animal including a human being , plant or seed having a fungal infection, which comprises treating said animal, plant or seed, or the locus of said plant, with an effective amount of a compound of the formula I or 0 ester or 0 ether thereof or with, as appropriateaa pharmaceutically or agriculturally acceptable salt thereof. When R is said optionally substituted phenyl group, it is preferably phenyl substituted by I to 3 substituents, more preferably I or 2 substituents, each independently selected fromF, CI, Br, I and CF3. The preferred individual groups represented by R are 4 fluorophenyl, 4 chlorophenyl, 4 bromophenyl, 4 iodophenyl, 4 trifluoromethylphenyl, 2 chlorophenyl, 2,4 dichlorophenyl, 2,4 difluorophenyl, 2 chloro 4 fluorophenyl, 2 fluoro 4 chlorophenyl, 2,5 difluorophenyl, 2,4,6 trifluorophenyl, 4 b romo 2,5 difluorophenyl and 5 chloro pyrid 2 yl. The most preferred groups represented by R are 2,4 difluorophenyl, 2,4 dichlorophenyl, 4 fluorophenyl, 4 chlorophenyl and 5 chloro pyrid 2 yl. In the most preferred individual compound, R is CH3 and R is 4 chlorophenyl. Typical 0 esters are C2 C4 alkanoyl e.g. acetyl and benzoyl esters. The phenyl ring of benzoyl esters can be substituted by, for example, 1 or 2 C C alkyl or halo groups. Typical 0 ethers are C1 C4 alkyl, C2 C4 alkenyl, phenyl C1 C4 alkyl and phenyl ethers. Again said phenyl groups can be ring substituted by, e.g., 1 or 2 C C alkyl or halo groups. The compounds of the formula I can be prepared in conventional manner according to the following reaction scheme EMI3.1 1,2,4 triazole, preferably in theEMI3.2 EMI3.3 In a typical reaction, the epoxide II , 1,2,4 triazole and anhydrous potassium carbonate are heated together at, say, 40 120 c, in a suitable solvent, e.g. anhydrous dimethylformamide, until the reaction is complete, usually in 2 16 hours. The product I can then be isolated and purified ina conventional manner. If a base salt of 1,2,4 triazole is used, it is preferably an alkali metal salt. The starting materials of the formula II are obtainable conventionally, e.g. EMI4.1 In the first stage of the above scheme, about one equivalent of sodium hydride and about one equivalent of methyl iodide should be used when monomethylation is desired, and at least two equivalents of each when dimethylation is required. Trimethylsulphoxonium iodide and either sodium hydride or sodium hydroxidelcetrimide can be used to generate dimethyloxosulphonium methylide in situ. When R is a phenyl group containing no ortho substituent, the cetrimide NaOH route should be used. The ketones III are either known compounds see e.g.European patent application publication no. 0044605 or U.K. patent application publication no. 2099818A or can be prepared by methods analogous to those of the prior art. According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a process for preparing the compounds of the formula I in which R1 is H, which comprises reacting a compound of the formula EMI5.1 where X and X1 are each a leaving group, preferably C1, Br or I, and R is as defined for formula I , with either 1,2,4 triazole, preferably in the presence of a base, e.g. potassium carbonate, or with a base salt, preferably an alkali metal salt, of 1,2,4 triazole. Preferably X and Xl are the same and are most preferably Br. Typically the compound V , 1,2,4 triazole and potassium carbonate are heated together at, say, 40 1200C, in a suitable organic solvent, e.g. dimethylformamide, until the reaction is complete. The product can be isolated and purified conventionally. The starting materials V are obtainable conventionally, e.g. EMI6.1 It is not necessary to isolate the intermediate v . It can be used directly. The O esters and O ethers can be prepared conventionally, typically by reacting an alkali metal salt of compound I with the appropriate chloro or bromo compound, e.g. an alkanoyl or benzoyi chloride, or alkyl, alkenyl, benzyl or phenyl chloride or bromide. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the formula I are those formed from strong acids which form non toxic acid addition salts, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, oxalic and methanesulphonic acids. The salts may be obtained by conventional procedures, e.g. by mixing solutions containing approximately equtmolar amounts of the free base and desired acid, and the required salt is collected by filtration, if insoluble, or by evaporation of the solvent, The compounds of the present application have been found to possess unexpectedly good activity against infections caused by the clinically important Aspergillus fungi. The compounds of the formula I and their O esters, 0ether and salts are antifungal agents, useful in combating fungal infections in animals, including humans. For example they are useful in treating topical fungal infections in man caused by, among other organisms, species of Candida, Trichophyton,Microsporum or Epidermophyton, or in mucosal infections caused byCandida albicans e.g. thrush and vaginal candidiasis . They can also be used in the treatment of systemic fungal infections caused by, for example, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans,Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Coccidioides, Paracoccidioides, Histoplasma or Blastomyces. The in vitro evaluation of the antifungal activity of the compounds can be performed by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration m.i.c. of the test compounds in a suitable medium at which growth of the particular micro organism fails to occur.In practice, a series of agar plates, each having the test compound incorporated at a particular concentration is inoculated with a standard culture of, for example, Candida albicans and each plate is then incubated for 48 hours at 37 C. The plates are then examined for the presence or absence of growth of the fungus and the appropriate m.i.c. value is noted. Other micro organisms used in such tests can include Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus,Trichophyton spp Microsporum spp Epidermophyton floccosum,Coccidioides immitis and Torulopsis glabrata. The in vivo evaluation of the compounds can be carried out at a series of dose levels by intraperitoneal or intravenous injection or by oral administration, to mice which are inoculated with, e.g., a strain of Candida albicans or Aspergillus flavus.Activity is based on the survival of a treated group of mice after the death of an untreated group of mice. The dose level at which the compound provides 50 protection against the lethal effect of the infection PD50 is noted. For human use, the antifungal compounds of the formula I and their salts, 0ether and O esters can be administered alone, but will generally be administered in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. For example, they can be administered orally in the form of tablets containing such excipients as starch or lactose, or in capsules or ovules either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of elixirs or suspensions containing flavouring or colouring agents.They can be injected parenterally, for example, intravenously, intramuscularly or subcutaneously. For parenteral administration, they are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example, enough salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic with blood. For oral and parenteral administration to human patients, the daily dosage level of the antifungal compounds of the formula I and their salts, 0 ethers and O esters will be from 0.1 to 10 mg kg in divided doses when administered by either the oral or parenteral route. Thus tablets or capsules of the compounds will contain from 5 mg to 0.5 g of active compound for administration singly or two or more at a time as appropriate. The physician in any event will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual patient and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient.The above dosages are exemplary of the average case there can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention. Alternatively, the antifungal compounds of formula I can be administered in the form of a suppository or pessary, or they may be applied topically in the form of a lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder. For example, they can be incorporated into a cream consisting of an aqueous emulsion of polyethylene glycols or liquid paraffin or they can be incorporated, at a concentration between 1 and 10 , into an ointment consisting of a white wax or white soft paraffin base together with such stabilizers and preservatives as may be required. The compounds of the formula I and their O ethers, O esters and salts also have activity against a variety of plant pathogenic fungi, including for example various rusts, mildews and moulds, and the compounds are thus useful for treating plants and seeds to eradicate or prevent such diseases. The in vitro evaluation of the activity of the compounds against plant fungi can be determined by measuring their minimum inhibitory concentrations in the same way as previously described except that the plates are incubated at 300C for 48 hours or longer before being examined for the presence or absence of growth. Micro organisms used in such tests include Cochliobolus carbonum, Pyricularia oryzae, Glomerella cingulata, Penicillium digitatum, Botrytis cinerea and Rhizoctonia solani. For agricultural and horticultural purposes the compounds and their agriculturally acceptable salts are preferably used in the form of a composition formulated as appropriate to the particular use and purpose desired. Thus the compounds may be applied in the form of dusting powders, or granules, seed dressings, aqueous solutions, dispersions or emulsions, dips, sprays, aerosols or smokes. Compositions may also be supplied in the form of dispersible powders, granules or grains, or concentrates for dilution prior to use. Such compositions may contain such conventional carriers, diluents or adjuvants as are known and acceptable in agriculture and horticulture and they are manufactured in accordance with conventional procedures. The compositions may also incorporate other active ingredients, for example, compounds having herbicidal or insecticidal activity or a further fungicide. The compounds and compositions can be applied in a number of ways, for example they can be applied directly to the plant foliage, stems, branches, seeds or roots or to the soil or other growing medium, and they may be used not only to eradicate disease, but also prophylactically to protect the plants or seeds from attack.
