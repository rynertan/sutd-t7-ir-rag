# Zero insertion force electrical connector.

## Abstract
The connector comprises two similar elements 12 and 13 each with a tongue 20 disposed between and in a plane parallel to the arms 24 and 26 . The elements 12 and 13 slide together as shown and are then rotated about an axis perpendicular to their planes such that the tip of tongue 20 on one element engages straight edges 28 of arm 24 on the other element while extensions 34 and 35 at the root of the tongue engage convex edge 30 of arm 26 of the other element. The arms are thus forced apart and exert a resilient grip on the tongue. Such connectors arranged in a plane perpendicular to the boards may serve as connecting hinges between printed circuit boards. In alternative constructions the connector elements are assymetrical, one having a spreader element which engages between resilient arms of the other and spreads them apart upon rotation. The spreader element itself may have a slot engaged by a spreader on the other connector element.
