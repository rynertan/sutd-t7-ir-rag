# Hydrogen cyanide process.

## Abstract
Hydrogen cyanide is produced from ammonia and carbon monoxide, or gases containing these compounds, while substantially avoiding the water shift reaction, by passing these compounds in contact with catalyst masses for example, alumina silica molecular sieves having a high protonic acid content. Protonic acid content can be measured by ammonium acetate titration.
