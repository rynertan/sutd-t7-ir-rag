## Description
OPTICAL INDICATOR CHALCOGEN COMPOUNDS AND METHODS FOR THEIR PREPARATION AND USE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. FIELD OF HE INVENTION The present invention relates to optical indicator compounds, and the methods for their preparation and use, which provide optical signals upon contact with oxidants, particularly hydrogen peroxide. In particular, the invention relates to fluorogenic indicators for hydrogen peroxide and their use in analytical systems, such as diagnostic test systems, which are based on the generation and detection of hydrogen peroxide in response to the analyte under determination. 2. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART Many analytical systemstinvolve the measurement of an oxidative substance as the ultimately detected substance. The analyte under determination may itself be such oxidant or the analyte may participate in a chemical, biological, immunological, or the like reaction that produces or destroys a measurable oxidant. These oxidants include substances such as hydrogen peroxide, ozone, periodates, peracids, and superoxides. In particular, the determination of oxidative enzyme activity is important in analytical chemistry and biochemistry because of its usefulness in clinical diagnostic systems. Among the more commonly studied oxidative enzymes are the oxidases which produce hydrogen peroxide, such as glucose oxidase, xanthine oxidase, and cholesterol oxidase. The hydrogen peroxide generated by the action of such enzymes on their substrates is generally quantitated by oxidationreduction reactions with various types of optical indicators, usually in the presence of peroxidase.One of the most sensitive means for quantitating hydrogen peroxide is by the use of fluorogenic peroxidase substrates which yield fluorescent products upon peroxidase catalyzed reaction with hydrogen peroxide. The literature contains relatively few examples of fluorogenic peroxidase substrates. Some such indicators that have been reported in the literature are homovanillic acid, 3 p hydroxyphenyl propionic acid, 4 amino 1z 1,5 benzodiazepine 3 carbonitrile, and diacetyldichlorofluorescin K. Zaitsu and Y. Ohkura,AnaZ. Biochem. 109 109 19.30 , H. Corrodi and B.Weidinius, Acta Chem. Scand. 19 1854 1965 , Y. Okamoto et a7t Chem. Pharm. Bull. 28 2325 1980 , A.S.Keston and R. Brandt, Anal. Biochem. 11 l 965 , and U.S.Pat. No. 4,269,938J. The fluorometric determination of hydrogen peroxide has also been accomplished using the fluorescent compound 6 methoxy 7 hydroxy l , 2 benzopyrone which is oxidized to a nonfluorescent product W.A. Andreae, Nature 1 5 859 1955 J. The known fluorogenic peroxidase substrates suffer from several disadvantages, particularly as applied to analytical systems for determining analytes in proteinaceous reaction mixtures, e.g., in immunoassays. Such disadvantages include lack of sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, instability in aqueous media, excitation wavelengths for the fluorescent product within the range of excitation wavelengths for proteins present in the reaction mixture, and an affinity for binding to proteins present in the reaction mixture. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a novel class of chalcogen compounds which serve as optical indicators for a variety of oxidants, particularly hydrogen peroxide. The present indicator compounds do not express a particular optical signal, e.g., light absorbance color or fluorescence, but upon oxidation by the desired oxidant a different compound is formed which does express the desired optical signal. The novel compounds of the present invention are, in general, prepared by first obtaining a dihydrocompound which comprises a residue of the formula EMI3.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen, cyano, carboxyl, alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, carboalkoxy, carboaryloxy, or carboxamide, andR2 is hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, or aryl. The dihydro compound is further characterized by not providing the desired optical signal but, upon an oxidation which replaces the single bond between the carbons bearing the R1 and R2 substituents with a double bond, yields the signal compound. Thus, one can begin by selecting the structure of the desired signal compound, e.g., a highly fluorescent molecule, and by chemical modification thereof or by synthesis from molecules which do not express the signal, prepare a dihydro analog of the signal compound. Then, in a second step, the dihydro compound is reacted to sulfenate or selenate the carbon atom bearing the R1 substituent to form the indicator compound wherein the residue depicted above now has the formula EMI4.1 wherein Q is sulfur or selenium herein referred to as chalcogen and R is alkyl or aryl, and preferably phenyl or substituted phenyl. Preferably, the depicted residue is part of a cyclic moiety, e.g., a heterocyclic ring, in the indicator compound, which includes coumarins and 2 quinolones. Upon exposure to an oxidant of appropriate oxidation potential, the sulfenyl or selenyl residue attached to the R1 substituent carbon is removed by formation of a sulfoxide or selenoxide intermediate which undergoes spontaneous elimination with generation of a double bond between the R1 and R2 substituent carbon atoms to yield the signal compound. Where the oxidant is hydrogen peroxide, the present invention provides a particularly advantageous class of coumarin and 2 quinolone chalcogen derivatives which serve as potent fluorogenic indicators of the peroxide. Such compounds have the general formula EMI4.2 wherein Q, R, R1 and R2 are as defined above R3 is S S 67 OR where R is hydrogen or lower alkyl, or NR R where R6 and R7, which may be the same or different are hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, or aryl n is an integer from 0 through 3 R4, which may be the same or different when n 2 or 3, is halo, alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy, or 8 8 aryl and Y isO or XN R8 wherein R8 is hydrogen or lower alkyl. The novel chalcogen indicator compounds of the present invention provide particularly potent optical indicators due to the unique application of the sulfoxide and selenoxide elimination reaction. The fluorogenic hydrogen peroxide indicators of formula A have particularly advantageous features. The indicator compounds are essentially nonfluorescent, react quickly with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a peroxidatively active substance such as peroxidase, are nonreactive with peroxidase alone, and are not interfered with by protein binding. The signal compounds produced upon oxidation are highly fluorescent, have excitation and emission wavelengths above that for background protein fluorescence e.g., above 400 nm , do not form interfering side products, are stable in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and peroxidatively active substances, and do not exhibit interfering protein binding. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figs. 1 3 are flow diagrams of particular synthetic paths for preparing sulfide and selenide indicator compounds of the present invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS As used herein, alkyl is intended to include aliphatic and cyclic organic residues having a carbon atom at the point of attachment which is bonded to one or more hydrogens or one or more carbons or heterocyclic atoms te.g., nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur3 by single bonds. Accordingly, alkyl groups include the unsubstituted hydrocarbon residues of the formula CmH2m 1 and substituted forms thereof.Such hydrocarbon residues include linear and branched forms and commonly are of the lower alkyl 1 aliphatic type wherein m is 6 or less e.g., methyl, ethyl, n propyl, iso propyl, n butyl, iso butyl, tert butyl, n hexyl, and so forth , but also include higher aliphatic alkyls such as heptyl, octyl, nonyl, and decyl, and the like, as well as cycloalkyls such as cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cyclooctyl, and so forth. As stated above, alkyl includes substituted residues which is intended to include the hydrocarbon residues bearing one or more same or different functional groups or substituents as discussed in detail below which are selected so as not to substantially negate the novel features of the present compounds. Aryl , as used herein, is intended to include organic residues derived from an aromatic hydrocarbon or heterocyclic ring or ring system by removal of a hydrogen atom. Accordingly, aryl groups include the unsubstituted hydrocarbon ring residues such as phenyl and naphthyl, and substituted forms thereof. Heterocyclic aryl residues are those comprising one or more heteroatoms e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur in their ring structure, such as pyridyl, triazoyl, furanyl, imidazolyl, quinolinyl, thiophenyl, thiazolyl, oxazolyl, oxadiazolyl, and pyrimidinyl, and substituted forms thereof.It is understood for the purposes of this invention that aryl residues include those bearing one or more same or different functional groups or substituents as discussed in detail below which are selected so as not to substantially negate the novel features of the present compounds. Further alkenyl includes alkyl groups as defined above wherein at least one C C single bond is replaced with a C C double bond, and therefore include the unsubstituted lower alkenyls, e.g., vinyl, 1propenyl, 2 propenyl, 2 propylidinyl, and so forth, as well as substituted forms thereof. Alkoxy and aryloxy intend ether linked alkyl and aryl groups, respectively, as defined above .g., methoxy, ethoxy, phenoxy . Carboalkoxy and Carboaryloxy intend carboxyl ester linked alkyl and aryl groups, respectively, as defined above e.g., acetyl, carbethoxy, benzoyloxy . Carboxamide intends unsubstituted and mono or di N substituted amido groups. In the context of the present invention, used herein, an indication that a particular group e.g., alkyl, aryl, alkenyl, and the like is substituted is intended to include such groups when mono or polysubstituted with functional groups which do not substantially negate the novel features of the present compounds. Such functional groups include essentially all chemical groups which may be introduced synthetically and result in stable indicator compounds.Examples of functional groups are hydroxyl, halo e.g.fluoro, chloro, bromo , amino including substituted amino such as alkylamino and dialkylamino , cyano, nitro, thiol, carboxyl including substituted carboxyl such as substituted and unsubstituted esters carboalkoxy and carboaryloxy and carboxamides , alkoxy, aryloxy, alkyl, and aryl. In general, the present invention is applicable to signal compounds having the residue of the formula EMI8.1 wherein R1 and R2 are as defined above and the carboncarbon double bond is critical to the chemical or physical properties of the signal compound which yield the detectable optical signal. Such optical signal may be any form of electromagnetic radiation in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light regions of the spectrum, for example, light absorption color , fluorescence, or phosphorescence.One can screen signal compounds for their usefulness in a particular analytical system and then modify the signal compound, or devise a synthetic route, to. yield the dihydrocompound which upon sulfenation or selenation gives the indicator compound of the present invention The signal compound residue depicted above can form a portion of a linear segment of the signal compound, or, as is more usual, can form a portion of a cyclic moiety of the signal compound. Examples of such cyclic moieties are five, six, and seven membered carboxyclic and heterocyclic aromatic and nonaromatic rings. Commonly, such cyclic moiety will be a six membered heterocyclic ring of the formula EMI9.1 wherein Y is a heteroatom, usually oxygen or nitrogen when nitrogen such heteroatom will bear hydrogen or a substituent attached to the ring .Such six membered heterocyclic ring moiety preferably is annealated to an aromatic ring which is usually substituted phenyl. There are principally two paths for obtaining the necessary dihydro compound. The first involves direct chemical modification of the signal compound to reduce the carbon carbon double bond to a single bond, thereby rendering the compound inactive, or substantially so, as a signal generator. The second involves a synthesis of the dihydro compound from compounds which do not provide the optical signal, and thus which do not include the signal compound. The sulfenation or selenation step is usually accomplished by treating the dihydro compound with base and a sulfenyl or selenyl compound of the formula X Q R wherein Q and R are as defined above and X is halo, e.g., fluoro, chloro, bromo, or iodo Q R or NW2 where N is lower alkyl, preferably unsubstituted.See K.B.Sharpless and M.W.Young, J. Org. Chem. 40 917 1975 A.Toshimitsu et aZ, Tet. Lett. 21 5047 1980 D. Liotta et aZ, J. Org. Chem. 46s14 2920 1981 B.M.Trost et aD, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 98 4887 1976 and H.J.Reich, Accounts Chem. Res. 12 22 1979 . Particularly preferred sulfenating and selenating agents are substituted or unsubstituted phenylsulfenyl halogens and phenylselenyl halogens such as phenylsulfenyl chloride and phenylselenyl chloride. In the case of a 6 dicarbonyl system i.e., where R1 is carboxyl, carboxyl ester, or amide , the preferred reaction conditions are an equimolar mixture of the phenyl chloride in methylene chloride. A monocarbonyl system is preferably modified by treatment with a strong base such as lithium diisopropylamide at about 78 C, followed by reaction with the phenyl chloride. The present invention will now be illustrated by particular description of preferred fluorogenic indicators for hydrogen peroxide and their preparation and use. Such indicators have the structure of formula A above. Where Y isEMI10.1 such compounds are coumarin derivatives, and where Y is 2 quinolone derivatives.EMI10.2 are Fluorogenic indicators A where Y is oxygen andR3 is hydroxyl, i.e., umbelliferone derivatives, can be prepared from the appropriate 7 hydroxy 3,4dihydrocoumarin V.S.Kamat et aZ, test. Lett. 23 154 1982 and W.D.Langley and R.Adams, J. Amer. Chem.Soc. 44 2320 1922 of the formula EMI11.1 The hydroxyl group is protected in an appropriate manner such as by conversion to its tertbutyldimethylsilyl ether see compound 2 in Fig. 1 and reacted with the sulfenating or selenating agentX Q R. Deprotection of the hydroxyl group yields corresponding indicator compounds A which are essentially nonfluorescent. However, upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide and peroxidase, the highly fluorescent coumarins of the formula EMI11.2 are produced with the concerted loss of the sulfenic or selenenic acid R SOH and R SeOH, respectively which introduces the critical double bond. Preferably,R is phenyl or substituted phenyl. The R1, R2 and R4 groups can vary widely within the groupings previously described.A wide variety of 3 substituted coumarins formula C , R1 CN, COOC2H5, COCH3,C6H5, CONH2, etc.j are known W.R.Sherman and E.Robins, Anal. Chem. 4O 803 1968 J or occur naturally in plants tHeterocyclic Compounds , vol. 2, ed. R.C. Elderfield,John Wiley 4 Sons New York 1951 pp. 214 216 . Many such naturally occurring coumarins contain substituents in the benzene ring formula C , R4 OH, alkoxy, alkyl, etc.l and others have been made synthetically J.I.DeGraw et aZ, J. Med. Chem. 17 375 1968 J.Banerji et aZ, J. Chem. Soc. C23 3992 1971 andM.Bandopadkyay et aZ, Indian J. Chem. 72 295 1974 . Such coumarin derivatives can be converted to the corresponding 3,4 dihydrocoumarin derivatives B by catalytic hydrogenation V.S.Kamat et al, supra and sulfenated or selenated to give indicator compounds A where Y is oxygen and R3 is hydroxyl. Where Y is oxygen and R3 is NR6R7, fluorogenic indicators A can be prepared by sulfenation or selenation of the appropriate 3,4 dihydrocoumarin with X Q R as described above. The required 7 amino3, 4 dihydrocoumarin of the formula EMI12.1 where R6 R7 Sìydrogen can be obtained by catalytic hydrogenation of the 7 amino or 7 nitrocoumarins. If 7 alkylamino or dialkylamino 3 ,4 dihydrocoumarins are desired, they can be prepared by N alkylation of a 7 aminodihydrocoumarin or catalytic hydrogenation of a Schiff base of a 7 aminodihydrocoumarin. Alternatively, the N alkylaminocoumarin can be prepared using the appropriate 3 alkylaminophenol or 3dialkylaminophenol as the starting material by the methods described below.The fluorescent species produced upon oxidation by hydrogen peroxide has the formula EMI13.1 7 Dialkylaminocoumarins, substituted in the 4 position R2 with alkyl or aryl, may be synthesized by condensation of a acylacetate with a 3 dialkylaminophenol A. Darlars, et aZ, Ang. Chem. Int. Ed., 665 1975 . 3 Substituted 7 aminocoumarins can be obtained by Knoevenagel condensation of a 4 amino 2hydroxy or 2 O protected benzaldehyde W.E. Solodar, et al, J. Org. Chem. 23 103 1958 E. Profft, et al,Arch. Pharm. 300 1 1967 or the Schiff base A.A.Goldberg, et aZ, J. Chem. Soc. 2641 1954 H.Ichibagase, J. Pharm. Soc.

Fluorogenic indicators CA where Y is NR8 and R3 is hydroxyl, i.e., 2 quinolone derivatives, can be prepared from the appropriate 7 hydroxy 3,4 dihydro 2quinolone N. Shigematsu, Chem. Pharm. BuZZ. 9 970 1961 3 of the formula EMI14.1 The hydroxyl group is protected in an appropriate manner such as by conversion to its 2 tetrahydropyranyl ether see compound 8 in Fig. 2 . The protected quinolone can then if desired be N alkylated such as by treatment with an appropriate substituted or unsubstituted alkyl halide N.Shigematsu, supra. Reaction with the sulfenating or selenating agent X Q R and deprotection of the hydroxyl group yields corresponding indicator compounds A which are essentially nonfluorescent.The fluorescent species produced upon oxidation by hydrogen peroxide has the formula EMI14.2 The Ri, R2 and R4 groups can vary widely within the groupings previously described. 3 Substituted dihydroquinolones formula G , R1 carboxyl, or substituted or unsubstituted carboxamide and alkyl carboxyester can be prepared by known transformations of the carbethoxy group whose method of introduction is disclosed in the Examples which follow. Also, the 7 hydroxyl group can be replaced with 7 Clower alkyl amino substituents with various derivatives being known N.Shigematsu, supra H.Veda and Z.H.Yan, J. Taiwan Pharmaceut. Assoc. 1 88C1949 , Y.Tamura et al, Chem. Ind. London 1975, 922 and G.S.Sidhu et aZ, Anna len 627 224 1959 . With reference to formula A depicting the structure of preferred fluorogenic indicators of the present invention, the various R, R1, R2, etc. substituent groups can vary widely without departing from the inventive features of the present invention. The substituent R generally will be selected from substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, usually methyl, or aryl e.g., phenyl and pyridyl . Substituted phenyls include phenyl substituted with one or more electron withdrawing groups such as halo or nitro or other groups which improve the elimination of the sulfenyl or selenyl residue upon oxidation of the indicator compounds. The R1 substituent can vary quite widely and generally will be hydrogen, cyano, carboxyl, alkyl, normally lower alkyl, alkenyl, also normally lower alkenyl, aryl, carboalkoxy, carboaryloxy, or carboxamide. The carboxyl esters are principally alkyl esters such as carbomethoxy, carbethoxy, and so forth, and carboxamide includes substituted amides such as Nalkylcarboxamides and N aralkylcarboxamides e.g.,N ethylcarboxamide, N butylcarboxamide, N benzylcarboxamide, N phenethylcarboxamide, and N 2 pyridylmethylcarboxamide. Preferably, R1 is of the formula CONHR9 wherein R9 is hydrogen or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl or aryl. Likewise, a wide variety of functional groups can comprise the R2 substituent. Usually R2 will be hydrogen, alkyl, normally unsubstituted lower alkyl or fluorosubstituted lower alkyl te.g., trifluoromethyl , alkenyl, again normally lower alkenyl, or aryl. The R4 substituents can be selected from those known to exist in coumarins and 2 quinolones found in nature or capable of being synthesized to give fluorogenic indicators. The R4 substituents, if present, i.e., where n is greater than or equal to 1 , occupy the 5 ,6 , and 8 position on the ring nucleus. When an R4 substituent is not present at any one or more of such positions, they are occupied by hydrogen.When n 1, the R substituent can be at any of the 5 , 6 , and 8 positions, commonly at the 5 or 6position, and preferably at the 6 position. When n 2, the two R4 substituents can be at the 5 and 6 , the 5 and 8 , or the 6 and 8 positions, and can be the same or different. Such R4 substituents include halo fluoro, chloro, bromo alkyl, normally unsubstituted lower alkyl, alkenyl, again normally unsubstituted lower alkenyl, alkoxy preferably unsubstituted lower alkoxy such as methoxy and methoxy , or aryl. In general, the R4 substituents can include any organic radical or functional group which either enhances or does not significantly negate the fluorescent properties desired in the signal compound produced upon elimination of the sulfenyl or selenyl residue. A preferred subset of fluorogenic indicators of hydrogen peroxide are those of the formula EMI17.1 wherein Q is sulfur or selenium, R is alkyl, phenyl, or substituted phenyl R1 is hydrogen, cyano, or is of the formula COOR9, CONHR9, or CON R9 2 where R9 is hydrogen, alkyl, alkenyl, or aryl R3 is OH or NR6R7 where R6 and R7, which can be the same or different, are hydrogen or lower alkyl, and Y is XO or ,N R8 where R8 is hydrogen or lower alkyl. Particularly preferred indicator compounds are those of formula A wherein Q sulfur or selenium, n 0, and R2 hydrogen, and the remaining substituents are selected from any combination of the following EMI17.2 tb SEP R SEP R1 SEP Y SEP R3 tb SEP e SEP COOalkyl SEP O SEP OH tb I tb SEP COOH tb SEP H tb SEP I SEP OCOalkyl tb SEP CONH2 SEP H tb SEP w SEP CONHalkyl SEP o SEP s tb O2N SEP CON alkyl SEP 2 SEP alkyl SEP NH2 tb SEP SEP 2 SEP N SEP NHalkyl tb SEP CN SEP CN SEP SEP SEP N alkyl 2 tb The novel chalcogen compounds of the present invention are useful as optical indicators for oxidants.Accordingly, the compounds find use in analytical systems for detecting or determining, qualitatively or quantitatively, either an oxidant capable of oxidizing the present compounds with elimination of the sulfenyl or selenyl residue or an analyte which participates in a reaction, e.g., a chemical, biological, or immunological reaction, to produce or destroy such an oxidant. Such oxidant is exemplified by substances such as ozone, periodates, peracids, superoxides, hydroperoxides, organic peroxides, and, in particular, hydrogen peroxide. The present invention provides particularly advantageous hydrogen peroxide sensitive indicators for use in analytical systems in the diagnostic field.Numerous diagnostic test systems are known which are based ultimately on the determination of hydrogen peroxide. For example, there are the determinations of various analytes such as glucose, galactose, choles terol, and uric acid, based on the action of specific oxidase enzymes e.g., glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase, cholesterol oxidase, uricase . Similarly, there are enzymatic test systems in which the analyte is reacted enzymatically or nonenzymatically to produce a product which in turn is reacted in one or more enzymatic or nonenzymatic steps to yield ultimately hydrogen peroxide. By appropriate selection of an indicator compound the resulting optical signal may be a color change, or, most adantageously, fluorescence as a function of hydrogen peroxide concentration. Furthermore, the present indicators are applicable to specific binding assays such as immunoassays in which a labeling substance is used which is detectable by generation of hydrogen peroxide. Such binding assay systems include those in which the label is an oxidase enzyme or an enzyme which produces a product which is then acted on enzymatically or nonenzymatically to yield hydrogen peroxide. Examples of such systems are the heterogeneous and homogeneous enzymelabeled immunoassays described in the literature such as in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,654,090 and 3,817,837. Alternatively, the label can be a substrate, an inhibitor, a coenzyme, or a prosthetic group for such an enzyme, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,279,992 4,238,565 4,134,792 and 4,273,866 and in U.K. Pat. Spec.1,552,607. It is preferred that the test sample or reaction mixture containing hydrogen peroxide to be determined with the present indicator compounds also be contacted with a peroxidatively active substance as is known in the field. Plant peroxidases, such as horseradish peroxidase or potato peroxidase, can be used. Inorganic compounds having peroxidase activity include iodides, such as sodium and ammonium iodides, and molybdates. In addition, urohemin and a number of other porphyrin substances having peroxidase activity can be used. The present invention will now be illustrated, but is not intended to be limited, by the following examples.
