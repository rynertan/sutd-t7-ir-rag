# Cordierite powders and protective coatings formed therefrom.

## Abstract
A substantially pure cordierite powder is applied by thermal spraying to components to provide a coating which protects the component against thermomechanical damage. The substantially pure cordierite powder is preferably made by fusing or premelting a cordierite forming mixture.
