# Colour video display terminal.

## Abstract
An inexpensive multi colour video display terminal makes use of a standard eight colour display monitor 28. A plurality of two level colour input signals on lines 18 are supplied to a converter 26, which also receives dot clock synchronising pulses on lines 29, 31. The converter converts these inputs to pulse width modulated signals which are applied over lines 27 to the RGB video inputs of the colour display monitor. The eight colour monitor is relatively cheap, and the conversion circuits are simple in construction, and in many cases may make use of components already available within the standard display monitor.
