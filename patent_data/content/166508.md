# Fuel briquettes.

## Abstract
Fuel briquettes of solid combustible material, notably bio mass material such as straw or other agricultural, horticultural and silvicultural waste or organic household waste, or fine par ticle industrial waste obtain a satisfactory storing and trans porting quality when the binder therein is 3 50 by weight of fly ash coke. Fly ash coke is the carbon rich fraction separated from the mineral components of fly ash, preferably by flota tion under specified conditions. The briquettes are prepared in a briquette press. Preferably, the extrusion nozzle pressure is 70 100 kg cmÂ² and it is advantageous to preheat the raw a materials to 50 70 C before conveying them to the briquette press.
