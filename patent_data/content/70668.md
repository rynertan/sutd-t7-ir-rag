# A flexible hose and method of supporting an elongate article, especially a cable, on this hose.

## Abstract
An elongate article, such as a pump power cable 14 , is secured to a flexible hose, for example a layflat well riser hose 12 , by providing the hose with integral support means such as a longitudinally extending rib 16 and providing tie means 20 to extend from the support means around at least part of the periphery to the hose to support the elongate article rela tive to the hose at a position which is remote from the support means. Preferably the elongate article is secured to the hose by a spaced series of tie means each arranged to encircle indi vidually the hose and elongate article in a figure 8 configura tion, with the elongate article lying diametrically opposite the support means.
