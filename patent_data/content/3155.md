# Method of manufacturing a device using a gold layer masking against a proton bombardment.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a device in which a surface of a body is provided with a gold layer masking against a proton bombardment, in which a gold pattern is formed by means of a photoetching process which gold pattern masks in a subsequent proton bombardment of the body, after which the gold pattern is removed, characterized in that the masking gold layer is obtained by providing on the body a quantity of gold simultaneously with a quantity of an addition which is small as compared with the quantity of gold.
