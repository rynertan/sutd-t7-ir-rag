# Schottky barrier diode and method of making it.

## Abstract
The anode 40 and cathode 32 of the diode are contigously located on a semiconductor surface and sepa rated by an insulating coating 36 on cathode contact 32 . Preferably the anode 40 consists of two regions 40 sepa rated by coated cathode contact 32 and laterally sur rounded by recessed oxide area 16 . The method of making includes the steps of forming cathode contact 32 of a layer of conductive material and applying insulative coating 36 onto it where after this step at least one area of the semiconductor surface adjoining coated cathode contact 32 is exposed, of blanket depositing a metal layer and causing the reaction of the metal with the semiconductor material to produce anode 40 that is self aligned with respect to cathode contact 32 . The diode may be incorporated into merged transistor logic devices in large scale integration applications.
