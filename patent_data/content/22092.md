# Re attachment device for an open end type spinning frame.

## Abstract
The device comprises a casing 8 which bears two distinct hinged articulated systems, of which one is activated by jacks 14 15 and includes four arms 9 10 11 12 of which two 10 and 11 are hinged together at one of their ends, while another 9 is hinged on the casing 8 and on the free end of the arm 10 , and the arm 12 is hinged on the casing 8 and at the middle of the arm 11 that bears a roller 13 to disengage the cop 6 from the drive shaft 7 . The other system comprises two parallel arms 16 and 17 hinged on an intermediate plate 18 , two parallel arms 19 and 20 hinged on said plate 18 and on a support 21 of the re attachment head 22 connected to a system of suction by means of a conduit 28 and including two motors 34 and 30 to drive in rotation a roller 31 controlling the cop 6 and to make its front part 26 rotate by 180 in respect of its rear part 25 . In the re attachment position the roller 31 is employed to rotate by friction a roller 53 located at the outlet of the turbine 1 .
