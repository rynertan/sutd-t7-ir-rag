# Method and apparatus for analyzing fluid sample.

## Abstract
A row composed of reaction vessels 105 is arranged on a turntable 140 and one unit of sample dispenser mechan ism 102, 108 as well as one photometer 103 and a plurality units of reagent feeding mechanism 112, 117, 114, 118 are arranged near said turntable. After a sample 101 is added to one specified reaction vessel 105 , said turntable 140 is rotated by 180 or more and stopped so as to advance said reaction vessel 105 containing said sample 104 by half a revolution plus one cell. During this rotation, approximately half of all the vessels 105 cross the light path of said photometer 103 for the absorbance of fluid in each vessel 105 to be measured. A reagent is added to said specified reaction vessel 105 at the next stop position after sampling in order to start reaction. Said turntable 140 is again rotated and stopped so as to advance said reaction vessel 105 by half a revolution plus one cell. During this rotation, said reaction vessel 105 crosses said light path of said photometer 103 for the absorbance of said reaction fluid to be measured. Said reaction vessel 105 stops at the second reaction vessel position beyond the initial sample adding position. During the course of repeated rotations, said specified reaction vessel 105 crosses said light path of said photometer 103 a number of times and is stopped at said sample adding position after it is washed to be ready for further use.
