# Zinc neutralised sulphonated elastomeric polymer and article formed from this polymer.

## Abstract
An elastomeric blend composition of a zinc neutralised sulfonated EPDM terpolymer having 10 to 60 meq. sulfonate groups per 100 grams of terpolymer and at least 8 parts by weight of terpolymer of zinc stearate. These compositions have improved flow properties compared with the unplasticized terpolymer.
