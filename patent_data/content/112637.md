## Description
CHEMICAL PROCESS FOR PREPARING H2 ANTAGONISTS This invention relates to a chemical process, and in particular to a process for the preparation of a small class of histamine H2 antagonists. A particular compound of interest that is prepared by this process is 2 2 5 methyl 4 imidazolylmethylthio ethylamino 5 3, 4 methylenedioxybenzyl pyrimidin 4 one known as oxmetidine or an acid addition salt thereof. Another particular compound of interest is 2 2 5 dimethylaminomethylfuran 2 ylmethylthio ethylamino 5 2 hydroxypyrid 4ylmethyl pyrimidin 4 one or an acid addition salt thereof. In the UK Patent Specifications 1,595,291 and 1,582,527 and in EP A 3677 and EP A 4793 general processes are described for the preparation of histamineH2 antagonists, which comprise the displacement by an amine of a leaving group from the 2 position of a pyrimidinone. For example oxmetidine is exemplified inUK Patent Specification 1,595,291 as being prepared by the reaction of a compound of the formula I with a compound of the formula II wherein Q is methylthioEMI1.1 and EP A 4793 exemplifies a process which comprises the reaction of a compound of the formula I with a compound of the formula II wherein Q is nitroamino NO2NH . The hereinbefore referred to furan derivative is exemplified in EP A 3677 as being prepared by the reaction of a compound of the formula III with a compound of the formula IV followed by the conversion of the methoxy group to a hydroxy groupEMI2.1 The reaction of the compound of the formula I and the compound of the formula II wherein Q is methylthio presents an environmental disadvantage in that the unpleasant methyl mercaptan is produced as a by product.The preparation of the compound of the formula II wherein Q is nitroamino, or the compound of the formula IV , involves the use of nitroguanidine which has been reported to explode after detonation of the dry solid.Thus the preparations of the compounds containing a nitroamino group represent disadvantageous aspects of the reaction between the compound of the formula I and the compound of the formula II wherein Q is nitroamino, and the reaction of the compounds of the formulae I and IV According to the present invention there is provided a process for the preparation of a compound of the formula V or an acid addition salt thereof EMI3.1 wherein R1 is 5 methylimidazol 4 y1, furan 2 yl or 5dimethylaminomethylfuran 2 yl and R2 is 3,4 methylenedioxyphenyl or optionally protected 2 hydroxypyrid 4 yl which process comprises reacting a compound of the formula VI or acid addition salt thereofEMI3.2 R 1.wherein R is as defined hereinbefore, with a compound of the formula VII EMI3.3 wherein R2 is as defined hereinbefore and R3 is C1 6alkyl and thereafter if desired i deprotecting a protected hydroxy group, ii converting a compound wherein R1 is furan 2 yl into a compound wherein R1 is 5 dimethylaminomethylfuran 2 yl, iii forming a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. Suitably R1 is 5 methylimidazol 4 yl. SuitablyR is furan 2 yl or 5 dimethylaminomethylfuran 2 yl. R2 is Suitably R2 is 3,4 methylenedioxyphenyl. SuitablyR2 is optionally protected 2 hydroxypyrid 4 yl.Suitable protected hydroxy groups include Cl 6alkoxy, benzyloxy and substituted benzyloxy groups. Such groups may be converted to hydroxy in conventional manner for example by acidic hydrolysis and hydrogenolysis. An especially preferred value for R2 is 2 methoxypyrid 4 yl. In a preferred aspect of this invention R1 is 5 methylimidazol 4 yl and R2 is 3,4 methylenedioxy phenol In another preferred aspect of this invention R1 is furan 2 yl or 5 dimethylaminomethylfuran 2 yl and R2 is optionally protected 2 hydroxypyrid 4 yl. FavourablyR2 is 2 methoxypyrid 4 yl. The reaction is conveniently performed in a solvent in which the reactants are,substantially inert and are soluble enough to react, for example a Cl 6alkanol, an ether solvent such as tetrahydrofuran or dimethoxyethane, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulphoxide, ethyl acetate or mixtures of such solvents, and optionally in the presence of water. Preferably the reaction is performed in a Cl 6alkanol for example methanol, ethanol, l propanol, 2 propanol or l butanol, of these methanol is favoured. Preferably in the compounds of the formula VII R1 is methyl or ethyl, favourably ethyl. Suitably substantially equimolar quantities of the compound of the formula VI and the compound of the formula VII are reacted. The compound of the formula VI is conveniently generated in situ from an acid addition salt for example a sulphate. The reaction is suitably performed under basic conditions. If an acid addition salt of the compound of the formula VI is used, then about a mole equivalent of base is required to generate the free base of the compound of the formula VI . Suitably the reaction of the free base of the compound of the formula VI with the compound of the formula VII is carried out in the presence of a base, which may be less than one equivalent, one equivalent or more than one equivalent for example between 0.25 and 5 equivalents. We have found two equivalents to be convenient, so that if an acid addition salt of the compound of formula VI is used, about three equivalents of base are generally used in the overall process. Suitably the base used in this process is an alkali metal hydroxide, carbonate or C1 6Ã¡lkoxide. Preferably the base is a sodium or potassium C1 6alkoxide, for example sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, sodium n propoxide, sodium isopropoxide, potassium methoxide, potassium ethoxide, potassium n propoxide or potassium isopropoxide. Of these sodium methoxide is favoured. The reaction may be performed at a temperature of from ambient to reflux. Suitably reflux temperatures, for example in methanol, for between 4 and 24 hours are convenient. The skilled man will appreciate that the compounds of the formulae VI and VII may react to give isomeric 1 and 3 substituted 2 aminopyrimidinones in addition to the desired compound. Surprisingly it has been found that the desired product is obtained in good yield with only a small proportion of the undesired isomeric by products. The desired product can be purified in conventional manner. The process of this invention avoids the disadvantages of the exemplified prior art processes referred to hereinbefore. One particularly advantageous manner of purification comprises the evaporation of the crude reaction mixture to afford an oily and or solid residue. Water is then mixed with this residue, the pH of the resultant aqueous layer being approximately 12, and the aqueous layer decanted off. The decanted aqueous layer contains the desired product and by products to approximately the same extent as does the residue, as adjudged by standard techniques, for example chromatography. Thus no purification is effected in the above procedure. If, however, the pH of the aqueous layer is lowered, to a pH below 8 for example about 5 to 8, more suitably,about 6 to 8, after mixing and decanting or extraction into organic solvent , the decanted aqueous layer contains very little of the desired product and substantially all of the impurities, the residue being surprisingly free of impurities. The fact that there is no purification when the aqueous layer is at a pH of about 12 and that a very effective purification is achieved when the pH is about 5 to 8 is unexpected and of significant advantage. Thus this is a preferred feature of the process of the present invention. Suitably the pH of the aqueous layer is lowered using an aqueous acid, for example hydrochloric acid or acetic acid. The compound of the formula V may be converted to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt in conventional manner for example using an equivalent of the desired acid in an organic solvent, for example isopropanol or ethanol. The conversion of a compound of the formula V wherein R is furan 2 yl to a compound of the formula V wherein R1 is 5 dimethylaminomethylfuran 2 yl may be performed by the methods disclosed in EP A 3677. The conversion of a compound of the formula V wherein R2 is a protected 2 hydroxypyrid 4 yl group to a compound of the formula V wherein R2is a 2 hydroxypyrid 4 yl group may be performed in conventional manner, selected as appropriate by the skilled man, for example by the methods of EP A 3677. It should be realised that when R 1.is is furan 2 yl certain methods of conversion of a protected hydroxy group to a hydroxy group may be inappropriate, for example treatment with concentrated mineral acid, as the unsubstituted furan 2 yl group is liable to decomposition at low pH values. The compounds of the formula VI and acid addition salts thereof are prepared in conventional manner, for example by reaction of a compound of the formula VIII with a compounds the formula IX R1 CH SCH CH NH2 R1 CH2SCH2CH2NH2 VIII EMI7.1 wherein R1 is as hereinbefore defined and X is a leaving group, for example C1 6alkylthio, preferably methylthio.Alternatively the compounds of the formula VI may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of formula VIII with cyanamide for example 50 aqueous cyanamide conveniently at reflux and conveniently at a slightly basic pH. The compounds of the formula VII are preparable by the methods of EP A 3677 and EP A 4793.
