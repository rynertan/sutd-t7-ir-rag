## Description
IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO NAPHTHYLGLYCYL CEPHALOSPORIN DERIVATIVES This invention relates to a new class of cephalosporins which are orally effective and possess advantageous pharmacokinetic properties. The cephalosporin antibiotics have been studied extensively, and several members of this class are used routinely to combat bacterial diseases caused by a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative microorganisms. The majority of such compounds are not effective orally, but rather are administered intramuscularly or intravenously, necessitating assistance from medically trained personnel. Moreover, because the compounds are effective against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, they generally are not employed for their specificity. A need remains for cepahlosperln antibiotics that are orally effective and have a degree of specificity toward one or more groups of microorganisms. This invention provides a group of compounds that satisfy these needs. In accordance with the invention, a 2 naphthyl glycylamido cephalosporin of Formula I EMI1.1 in which R1 isEMI2.1 in which R7 and R8, independently, are hydrogen, halo, hydroxy, C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, nitro, amino,C1 C4 alkanoylamino, C1 C4 alkylsulfonylamino, or whenR and R8 are taken together they form methylenedioxy A and B, both, are hydrogen, or taken together complete a double bond R2 is hydrogen, an amino protecting group, hydroxy, or methoxy, and R3 is hydrogen, or R2 and R3 taken toqether areEMI2.2 where M and L independently, are C1 C4 alkyl R4 is hydrogen, methoxy or methylthio R5is hydrogen, methoxy, methyl, halo, or methoxymethyl R6 is hydrogen, or a carboxy protecting group with the proviso that R2 is hydroxy or methoxy only whenA and B complete a double bond, and that A and B, both, are hydrogen when R3 is other than hydrogen or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is useful as an orally active antibiotic or as intermediates thereto. Preferred compounds provided by the invention include those of Formula I in which R1 is EMI3.1 and R7 and R8 are as defined previously. Within this group, preferred compounds include those in which R2 is hydrogen, an amino protecting group, hydroxy or methoxy, and R6 is hydrogen or a carboxy protecting group. Another preferred group of compounds are those in which R1 isEMI3.2 and R7 and R8 are as defined previously. Especially preferred compounds within this group include those in which A, B, R2, R, R4 and R6 are all hydrogen. A particulArly preferred group of compounds of this invention is defined by the Formula EMI4.1 in which RS, R6 and R7 are as defined previously. The most preferred compounds are those in which R7 is hydrogen, halo, hydroxy or methoxy, R5 is methyl or chloro, and R6 is hydrogen, or a pharmaceuticallyacceptable salt thereof, such as the sodium or potassium salt This invention also provides a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a naphthylglycylamido cephalosporin derivative of Formula I , or a pharmaceuticallyacceptable salt thereof, associated with a pharmaceutical carrier, diluent or excipient therefor.A preferred formulation is one suitable for oral admin istration In another embodiment of this invention there is provided a method for treating bacterial infections in animals which comprises administering to the animal an effective amount of an antibacteridl compound of Formula I , or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In a preferred method of treatment, the naphthylglycylamido cephalosporin derivative is administered orally to treat diseases caused by gram positive bacteria. In addition, there is provided a process for preparing a compound of Formula I which comprises A acylating a compound of Formula II EMI5.1 with an acylating agent of Formula III EMI5.2 or an activated derivative thereof, in which A, B, R1 R2, R4 R5 and R6 are as defined above, followed, optionally, by removal of any amino or carboxyl protecting groups present B deblocking of a protected acid of Formula I in which R6 is a carboxy protecting group to provide a compound of Formula I in which R6 is hydrogen C removal of an amino protecting group, R2, from a compound of Formula I to provide a compound of Formula I in which R2 is hydrogen, D when it is desired to form a compound in which R2 and R3, when taken together form a group of the Formula EMI6.1 reacting a compound of Formula I , in which and both are hydrogen, with a ketone of the Formula c O L in which M and L are as defined earlier or, E reducing a compound of Formula I in which A and B are taken together to form a double bond and a2 is hydroxy or methoxy1 to produce a compound of Formula I in which A, B, and R2 are hydrogen and, F if desired, salifying a compound of formula G or, if desired, converting a salt of a com pound of Formula I to the free amine or acid. In the formulae above, RÃš represents a 2naphthyl or 2 tetrahydronaphthyl group. The naphthyl and tetrahydronaphthyl groups may be unsubstituted, for instance, when R7 and a a both are hydrogen monosubstituted at the 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 positions, for instance, when R8 hydrogen and R7 is other than 7 8 hydrogen or di substituted when R7 and R8, both, are other than hydrogen. The groups with which the naphthyl and tetrahydronaphthyl rings may be substituted include hydroxy, C1 C4 alkyl, C1 C4 alkoxy, halo, nitro, amino, C1 C4 alkanoylamino and C1 C4 alkylsulfonylamino. The term C 1 C4alkyl 1 carries its art recognized meaning of straight and branched lower alkyl carbon chains such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, npropyl, iso butyl and tert butyl. Similarly, C1 C4 alkoxy refers to lower alkyl groups bonded to the naphthyl ring through an oxygen atom. Typical C1 C4 alkoxy groups include methoxy, ethoxy, n propoxy, n butoxy and iso butoxy. The term halo includes fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. A preferred halo group is chloro. C1 C4 Alkanoylamino refers to an acyl residue of a lower alkanoic acid, bonded to the naphthyl or tetrahydronaphthyl ring through a nitrogen atom. Such groups include formylamino, acetylamino and butyrylamino. Crc4 Alkylsulfonylamino means a group such as.methylsulfonylamino, ethylsulfonylamino and n butylsulfonylamino. pÃª represents a substituent on the glycyl nitrogen atom, and may include hydrogen and an aminoprotecting group. The term amino protecting group refers to any of the art recognized substituents that can be attached to an amino nitrogen atom and which is removed readily when desired. Such protecting groups often are employed during preparation of the compounds of the invention, and serve to decrease the likelihood of unwanted side reactions occurring as a result of the presence of a free amino group. While the compounds in which R2 is a protecting group will have biological activity, it is contemplated that the most biologically desirable compounds will be those in which R2 is hydrogen. The compounds in which R2 is an aminoprotecting group are thus primarly useful as intermediates in the synthesis of the more preferred free amino compounds. The precise nature of the amino protecting group is not critical to the invention, and any of the well known protecting groups can be employed. Typical amino protecting groups are described by J.W. Barton in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, J.F. McOmie,Ed., Plenum Press, New York, N.Y., 1973, Chapter 2, and by Greene in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis , John, Wiley Sons, New York, N.Y., 1981, Chapter 7.Both of these references are incorporated herein by reference for their teaching of amino protecting groups. The most common amino protecting groups to be employed may include C1 C10 alkanoyl and halo C1O alkanoyl groups such as formyl, acetyl, chloroacetyl, dichloroacetyl, propionyl, hexanoyl, 3,3 diethylhexanoyl, or y chlorobutyryl,. C1 C10 alkoxycarbonyl and C2 c10 alkenyloxycarbonyl groups such as methosycarbonyl, tertbutoxycarbonyl, and allyloxycarbonyl, C5 C15 aryloxycarbonyl and arylalkenyloxycarbonyl such as benzyl oxycarbonyl, 4 ni trobenzyl oxycarbonyl and cinnamoyl oxycarbonyl halo C1 C10 alkoxycarbonyl such as 2,2,2 trichloroethoxycarbonyl and C5 C15 arylalkyl and alkenyl groups such as benzyl, phenethyl, trityl, or allyl. Other commonly used amino protecting groups include enamines prepared by reaction of the free amino compound with a ss keto ester such as methyl or ethyl acetoacetate. In addition to representing hydrogen or an amino protecting group, R2in the above formulae can be taken with R3 to complete a ring system so as to form compounds of the Formula EMI9.1 in which R , R4, R5, Rb, M and L are as defined previously. Exemplary of such compounds are the acetonides, those in which M and L are both methyl. Such compounds are prepared by reacting a glycylamido cephalosporin in which R2 and R3, both, are hydrogen with a ketone such as acetone. These cyclic compounds are particularly useful as long acting antibacterial agents. R6 in the above formula is hydrogen, an addition salt cation such as ammonium or an alkali metal cation such as lithium, sodium or potassium or a carboxy protecting group The term carboxy protecting group refers to the art recognized groups commonly employed to block or protect the carboxylic acid functionality of a cephalosporin during chemical reactions involving other functional sites in the molecule, and which can be removed readily when desired by commonly known techniques such as hydrolysis or hydrogenolysis. Typical carboxy protecting groups to be employed according to this invention include those described byE. Raslam in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, supra, Chapter 5, and by Greene in Protective Groups inOrganic Synthesis, supra, Chapter 5, which are incorporated herein by reference. Examples of commonly employed carboxy protecting groups may include C1 C10 alkyl groups such as method, tert butyl, decyl halo C1 C10 alkyl such as 2,2,2 trichloroethyl, and 2 iodoethyl C5 15 arylalkyl such as benzyl, 4 methoxybenzyl, 4 nitrobennyl, diphenylmethyl, triphenylmethyl C1 C10 alkanoyloxymethyl such as acetoxymethyl, or propionoxymethyl and other groups such as phenacy.4 halophenacyl, allyl, dimethylallyl, tri Cl C3 alkyl silyl such as trimethylsilyl, and related groups. The naphthylglycyl and tetrahydronaphthyl glycyl cephalosporins provided by this invention can be prepared by any of several methods, one of which comprises coupling a 7 aminocephalosporin nucleus ofFormula II EMI10.1 in which R4, R5 , and R6 are as defined previously, to a naphthylglycine compound of Formula III , or an acti vated derivative thereof EMI11.1 in which A, B, R1, R2, R4, R5 and R6 are as defined earlier.Examples of cephalosporin nuclei that may be employed in the synthesis of the compounds of this invention may include those in which R4, R5 and R6 have the following meanings R4 R5 R6 H CH3 H H CH3 tert butylCH3O CH3 p nitrobenzyl H CH3 2,2,2 trichloroethyl H C1 H H Cl tert butyl H Cl phenacylCH3S Cl methylCH3O H H H H p nitrobenzylCH3S CH2OCH3 diphenylmethyl H CH2OCH3 tert butyl H H trimethylsilyl H Cl tritylCH3O CH3 tert butyl H Br H H F methyl H OCH3 H H CH3 p nitrobenzylCH3S CH3 tert butyl H C1 alkyl H Br 2,2,2 trichloroethyl H r methyl The 7 aminocephalosporin nuclei to be employed in the synthesis of compounds of this invention are well known in the art and are readily available by art known methods.For example, the 3 halo cephalosporin nuclei are available by the methods described inU.S. Patent No. 3,925,372. 3 Methyl cephalosporin nuclei can be prepared by ring expansion of penicillin sulfoxides and subsequent side chain cleavage, or by hydrogenation of 3 acetoxymethyl derivatives. The term activated derivative means a derivative which renders the carboxyl function of the acylating agent of Formula III reactive to coupling with a primary amino group to form the amide bond which links the acyl side chain to the nucleus. Suitable activated derivatives, their methods of preparation, and their use as acylatinq agents for a primary amine will be recognized by those skilled in the art. Preferred activated derivatives are a an acid halide such as the chloride or bromide, or b alkanoyloxy derivatives such as formyloxy or acetoxy mixed anhydrides e.Ã§. Y in the list below is HCHO or OCOCR3 . Other methods for activating the carboxyl function may include reaction of the carboxylic acid with a carbodiimide eq. N,N dicyclohesylcarbodiimide or N,N diisopropylcarbodiimide to give a reactive intermediate which is reacted in situ with the 7 amino group. This reaction is discussed in detail later. Similarly, the naphthylglycyl and tetrahydronaphthylglycyl reactants defined by Formula III are known in the art and are prepared employing wellknown procedures. Typical naphthylglycyl and tetra hydronaphthylglycyl derivatives which may be employed to prepare the compounds of the invention have the above formula in which RÃª, R7 and R8 may have the following meanings EMI15.1 R7 R8 RÃª Y H H H Cl hydrochloride H H chloroacetyl OH H 5 OCH3 allyloxycarbonyl OH H 6 OCH3 tert butoxycarbonyl Cl H 7 OCH3 benzyl Br H 8 OCH2CH3 trimethylsilyl OCHO 1 Cl 5 OCH3 p nitrobenzyl OCOCH3 3 Cl 7 Cl H Br hydrobromide 3 Cl H benzyloxycarbonyl Br 4 OCH3 tert butoxycarbonyl Cl H 7 NO2 methyl acetoacetate enamine OH 3 NO2 8 I 2,2,2 trichloro ethoxycarbonyl Cl 7 CH2CH2 5 CH3 allyloxycarbonyl OH H 6 CH3 formyl Cl H 7 CH2CH3 acetyl OH 1 OH 8 CH2CH2CH3 benzoyl HCHO The coupling of a naphthylglycine or tetrahydronaphthylglycine derivative with a 7 aminocephalo sporin nucleus can be accomplished employing common techniques of acylation.For example, a naphthylglycyl acylating agent, especially the acid chloride or bromide or an alkanoyloxy derivative such as formyloxy or acetoxy anhydrides, can be reacted with a cephalosporin nucleus employing standard acylation conditions. During such acylation reactions, it generally is preferred thatRÃª be an amino protecting group and that R6 be a carboxy protecting group. These protecting groups serve to minimize unwanted side reactions and to increase solubility characteristics of the respective reactants. The acylation reaction generally is accompolished by combining approximately equimolar quantities of a naphthylglycyl or tetrahydronaphthylglycyl acylating agent of Formula III e.s. an acid halide or mixed acid anhydride with the 7 aminocephalosporin nucleus.The acylation reaction normally is performed in a mutual solvent such as benzene, chloroform, dichloromethane, toluene, N, N dimethylformamide, or acetonitrile, and routinely is complete after about I to about 12 hours when conducted at a temperature of about 20 to about 60 c. About an eqLiimolar quantity of a base such as pyridine, triethylamine, aniline, or sodium carbonate can be employed in the reaction, if desired, to act as an acid scavenger.The product may be isolated from the reaction mixture by removing the reaction solvent, for instance by evaporation under reduced pressure, and further purification can be accomplished, if needed, employing routine techniques such as chromatography, crystallization, solvent extraction, and other related methods. An alternative and preferred method for coupling a naphthylglycyl or tetrahydronaphthylglycyl derivative to a 7 aminocephalosporin nucleus to produce compounds of the invention employs a coupling reagent such as those routinely used in the synthesis of peptides. Typical coupling reagents that may be employed include carbodiimides such as N,N diethyl carbodiimide, N,N diisopropylcarb6diimide, and N,Ndicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC carbonyl coupling reagents such as carbonyldiimidazole isoxazolinium salts such as N ethyl 5 phenylisoxazolinium 3 sul fonate and quinoline compounds such as N ethoxycarbonyl 2 ethoxy 1,2 dihydroquinoline EEDQ . The coupling of a 7 aminocephalosporin nucleus with a naphthylglycyl or tetrahydronaphthylglycyl derivative employing a peptide coupling reagent gener ally is accomplished by combining approximately equimolar quantities of a 7 aminoceph 3 em 4, carboxylic acid derivative, a naphthylglycine derivative, and a peptide coupling reagent according to the following scheme EMI18.1 in which Rl, RÃª, R4, R5 and R6 are as defined earlier.Preferably, during such coupling reactions, R2 is an amino protecting group and R6 is hydrogen or a carboxyprotecting group. Any protecting groups can be removed subsequently by standard methods to give the active antibiotic of the invention. The coupling reaction normally is conducted in a mutual solvent such as dichloromethane, acetone, water, acetonitrile, N, N dimethylformamide, or chloro form, and routinely is complete when carried out for about ten to about ninety minutes at a temperature of about 20 to about 600C. Longer reaction periods are not detrimental and can be employed if desired. The product, a naphthylglycyl or tetrahydronaphthylglycyl cephalosporin, is isolated readily by simply removing the reaction solvent, for instance by evaporation under reduced pressure . The product may be purified further by other standard methods such as acid base extraction, chromatography, salt formation or the like. Another method for preparing compounds of the invention employs a naphthyl oxime of the formulaEMI19.1 or an activated derivative thereof, in which Rl is defined above, and R2 is hydroxy or methoxy. When R2 is hydroxy, it typically will be protected with a group such as trimethylsilyl or similar hydroxy protecting group Such naphthyl oxime derivatives can be coupled to a cephalosporin nucleus by any of the methods described above to provide a compound of the Formula EMI19.2 in which RI, R4, R5, and R6 are as defined earlier.These compounds are useful as intermediates because they are reduced readily by normal methods to give the preferred naphthylglycylamido compounds of the invention. Additionally, the oximes of the above formula in whichR6 is hydrogen, or a salt thereof, are useful as anti biotic Compounds that bear a nitro group on the naphthylglycyl or the tetrahydronaphthylglycyl side chain can be modified to provide other compounds of the invention For example, the nitro substituent can be reduced by routine reduction or hydrogenation procedures to give the corresponding amino substituted naphthylglycyl cephalosporin derivative, and if desired the amino group can be acylated by reaction with a C1 C4 alkanoyl halide or anhydride or a C1 C4 alkylsulfonyl halide to provide the corresponding alkanoylamrno or alkyl sul fonyl amino naphthylglycylamido and tetrahydro naphthylglycylamido cephalo sporins of or the invention. Similarly, compounds of the invention in which and are taken together to form the groupEMI20.1 are prepared by reacting a ketone of the formulaEMI20.2 with a compound of the invention in which R2 and R3, both, are hydrogen, generally in the presence of an acid such as methanesulfonic acid or the like The cyclic compounds produced, for instance the preferred acetonides in which X and L both are methyl, are particularly useful as oral antibiotics because they are effective over prolonged periods of time. Other compounds of the invention that are expected to be particularly long acting antibiotics are those in which R2 is an alkanoyl amino protecting group such as formyl or acetyl. Such compounds are prepared conveniently by simply reacting a naphthylglycylamido cephalosporin, in which R2 is hydrogen, with a C1 C10 alkanoyl acylating agent, for instance formyl chloride or acetic anhydride. These N acylated products are expected to act not only as antibiotics in themselves, but also as pro drugs in that they will be hydrolyzed in an animal system to the parent naphthylglycyl or tetrahydronaphthylglycyl derivative. Because the naphthylglycyl and tetrahydronaphthylglycyl side chains of the cephalosporins of this invention contain an asymmetric carbon atom, for example when A is hydrogen, the compounds of the invention can exist in the form of optical isomers, namely the D and the L isomers. The compounds of the invention can be employed as a D,L mixture to treat bacterial infections in animals, or if desired the optical isomers can be separated and employed individually.While both isomers are effective antibacterial agents, one isomer appears to be more potent than the other and is designated theD isomer, and accordingly is a preferred embodiment of the invention Separation or resolution of the optical isomers can be accomplished by routine methods carried out on the cephalosporin product of the invention or on the naphthylglycine or tetrahydronaphthylglycine side chain employed as a starting material. Separation of optical isomers generally will be accomplished by high performance chromatography, enzymatic resolution, or chemical crystallization or racemization. A particularly preferred method for obtaining D naphthylglycine comprises reacting the D,L mitture with benzaldehyde and optically active tartaric acid according to the method of U.S. Patent No. 3,976,680. As noted above, preferred compounds of the invention are those in which in the above formula is hydrogen. Such compounds, being primary amines, are basic in nature and readily form pharmaceuticallyacceptable salts by reaction with acids. Those salts which are pharmaceutical ly acceptab I e are preferred forms of salts used to treat bacterial infections. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are those salts useful in the chemotherapy of warm blooded animals.Typical acids commonly employed to form salts include inorganic acids such as hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, sulfuric acid, or phosphoric acid as well as organic acids such as acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, succinic acid, methanesulfonic acid, oxalic acid, or para toluenesulfonic acid. The compounds of the in vention in which both R2 and R6 are hydrogen readily form an internal acid addition salt, namely a zwitterion. The compounds of the invention generally exist as crystalline solids and can be crystallized from common solvents such as ethanol, water, N, N dimethyl formamide, acetone and the like. Further, the compounds in which is hydrogen are the 4 carboxylic acids.Such compounds are acidic and readily form salts with organic and inorganic bases. WPharmaceutically acceptable salts , as used herein, also includes these base addition salts. The compounds of the present invention often crystallize as a solvate or hydrate and can be used in this form. As an example, this invention provides a crystalline composition of matter which is 7 D 2naphthylglycylamido 3 methyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid tetrahydrate. The crystals are large, dense and stable, and readily lend themselves to milling and grinding for adaptation to pharmaceutical formulation, particularily into solid dosage forms such as filled capsules and the like. The tetrahydrate of this invention is prepared by isolating 7 D 2 naphthylglycylamido 3 methyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid, a preferred product of the invention, from an aqueous medium..

For example, a salt such as the trifluoroacetic acid salt or the hydrochloric acid salt can be dissolved in water or a mixture of water and an organic solvent such as acetone or acetonitrile. A base such as aqueous ammonium hydroxide is added to adjust the pH to about 3 to about 5. The precipitate that forms is the tetrahydrate of this invention and is readily recrystallized from water. The compound of this invention alternatively can be prepared by isolating the product of the acylation of 7 amino 3 methyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid 7 ADCA from a solvent containing water. For example, 7 ADCA, typically as a silylated derivative, may be acylated with an N protected D 2 naphthylglycine acid halide or mixed anhydride as described earlier. The acylation generally may be carried out in an organic solvent such as acetonitrile. Once the acylation is complete, the protecting groups can be removed by standard procedures and the solution of 7 D 2 naphthylglycylamido 3 methyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid can be diluted with water so that it contains about 10 to 50 by volume of water, and the pH of the solution can be adjusted to about pE 3 to about 5. The crystalline product produced is 7 D 2 naphthylglycylamido 3 methyl 3 cephem 4carboxylic acid tetrahydrate. This crystal form is very stable for prolonged periods of time, yet is very well absorbed following oral administration This is somewhat surprising since the compound is only minimally soluble in water. For example, the compound forms a saturated solution in water at 37 C according to the following table Solubility, mg ml 1.2 8.6 2.0 1.7 3.0 0.2 4.0 0.2 5.0 O.2 6.0 0.3 7.0 0.8 7.5 1.2 8.0 4.1 8.5 7.5 Another example of a hydrated form of a compound of the invention is 7 D 2 naphthylglycylamido 3 methyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid hydrochloride monohydrate. The crystals of this compound are large, dense and stable, and readily lend themselves to milling and grinding for adaptation to pharmaceutical formulation, particularily into solid dosage forms such as filled capsules and the like. The hydrochloride monohydrate is prepared by crystallizing 7 D 2 naphthylglycylamido 3 methyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid from an aqueous hydrochloric acid medium.

Sufficient hydrochloric acid is employed to maintain the pH of the solution below about 2.0, generally about 0.1 to about 0.8.The reaction normally is complete after about one to about three hours when carried out at a temperature of about 0 to about 600C. The precipitate that forms is the hydrochloride monohydrate and is isolated readily by standard means. Alternatively, the compound can be prepared by isolating the product of the acylation of 7 amino 3methyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid 7 ADCA from a solvent containing aqueous hydrochloric acid. For example, 7 ADCA, typically as a silylated derivative, can be acylated with an N protected D 2 naphthylglycine acid halide or mixed anhydride. The acylation generally may be carried out in an organic solvent such as acetonitrile Once the acylation is complete, the protecting groups can be removed by standard procedures and the solution of 7 D 2 naphth,ylglycylamido 3 methyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid can be diluted with water so that it contains about 10 to 50 by volume of water, and the pH of the solution can be adjusted to about pH 0.1 to about 0.8 by addition of hydrochloric acid.The crystalline product that forms is 7 D 2 naphthyl glycylamido 3 methyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid hydrochloride monohydrate.

In addition to possessing potent antibacterial activity against a wide variety of microorganisms, particularly gram positive organisms and anaerobes, the compounds of this invention also have demonstrated very favorable pharmacokinetics in animals.For example, when 7 2 naphthylglycylamido 3 methyl 3 cephem 4 carboxylic acid was administered to rats at an intravenous dose of 20 mg kg, the plasma concentration after one hour was 18.6 pg ml after four hours, 14.1 pg ml and after twenty four hours, the plasma level was still measured as 1.96 pg ml. The compound is efficiently orally absorbed in rodents and exhibits higher and longer blood levels than cefaclor and cephalexin. The compounds of the invention also have good stability to lactamases. Table IV shows the results of comparative studies of. several cephalosporins. lower numbers mean greater stability to the indicated R lactamase .

The compounds are.especially well suited for the treatment of out patients, and especially for subjects suffering from mild upper respiratory infections caused by gram positive microorganisms. A means for treatment of animals suffering from bacterial diseases, or suspected of developing a bacterial infection, also is provided by this invention.The antibacterial method of treatment provided may be practiced by administering to an animal in need of treatment an antibacterially effective amount of a naphthylglycyl cephalosporin antibiotic. The method can be practiced therapeutically or prophylactically. The amount of active antibiotic to be administered will vary depending upon the particular compound selected for use, the severity of the disease being treated or guarded against, the individual undergoing treatment,, and related factors commonly encountered with such treatments. Normally, however, the compounds will be administered at a dose of about 0.5 to about 50 mg kg of animal body weight, and more preferably at a rate of about 1 to about 10 mg kg. Such amounts may be administered once or twice each day, or more often as needed to treat the particular disease or subject undergoing treatment. A typical daily dose for an average adult human will be about 200 to about 500 mg per day. The antibiotic compounds provided by this invention are active by both the oral and parenteral routes of administration, and accordingly can be formulated for any such desired route of administration.Such formulations constitute yet another embodiment of this invention. The formulations of this invention will comprise from about 0.1 to about 95 percent by weight of an active naphthylglycyl cephalosporin antibiotic of the invention, admixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient there for.Typical formulations will contain from about 10 to about 60 percent by weight of active ingredient, and more preferably about 20 to about 50 percent. For convenient oral administration, the compounds can be admixed with, any of a number of diluents, recipients and carriers commonly employed in oral formulations, and molded into tablets, pills, troches, or encapsulated into gelatin capsules. Typical carriers, diluents and excipients commonly employed include potato starch, corn starch, sucrose, dextrose, microcrystalline cellulose, dicalcium phosphate, alginic acid, acacia lubricants such as magnesium stearate binders such as gum tragacanth or gelatin and flavoring agents such as peppermint oil, cherry or strawberry flavoring, oil of wintergreen, and the like. The compounds also can be formulated as syrups or elixirs employing common diluents such as a fatty oil, methyl or propylparabens, suitable dyes and flavoring agents.The compounds can also be formulated in the form of a buccal seal, lozenge or other suitable device for sustained controlled delivery of the active ingredient over a prolonged period. The antibiotics of the invention also can be formulated for parenteral administration, for example via the intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous routes, as well as the transdermal route. Such compositions normally will contain from about 0.1 to about.20.0 percent by weight of active ingredient. Typical excipients, diluents and carriers for parenteral formulations may include, for example, isotonic saline, dilute aqueous dextrose, the polyhydric aliphatic alcohols or mixtures thereof, for instance glycerin, propy1eneglycol, or polyethylene glycol. Parenteral solutions may also contain preservatives such as phenethylalcohol, methyl and propyl parabens, or thimerosal. If needed, about 0.05 to about 0.20 percent by weight of an antioxidant such as sodium metabisulfite or sodium bisulfite also can be employed.For intravenous use, preferred formulations will employ an initial concentration down to about 0.05 to about 0.25 mg ml of active ingredient, and for intramuscular injection, a preferred concentration of active ingredient is about 0.25 to about 0.50 m ml. The following examples illustrate typical formulations which may be used.
