# POSITIVE TYPE PHOTOSENSITIVE RESIN COMPOSITION

## Abstract
A positive type photosensitive resin composition com prises a mixture of 100 parts by weight of an alkalisoluble resin and from 5 to 100 parts by weight of I at least one 1,2 quinonediazidesulfonic acid ester of a natural coloring matter selected from α pyrone compounds having hydroxyl groups, γ pyrone compounds having hydroxyl groups, diaz ine compounds having hydroxyl groups and quinone com pounds having hydroxyl groups, II at least one 1,2 quin onediazidesulfonic acid ester of a hydroxybenzoate com pound, or a combination of I and II . This positive type photosensitive resin composition has a high sensitivity, a high resolution and a high yield of residual film thickness and also has excellent developability and is well suited for use as a high resistant photoresist for making integrated circuits.
