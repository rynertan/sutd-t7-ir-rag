# A method for forming a crystalline film of a paramagnetic sodium thallium type intermetallic compound and apparatus for performing said method.

## Abstract
An intermetallic compound having a dual diamond crystal structure e.g. LiAl, LiCd or LiZn is formed on a substrate surface. A layer containing the constituent elements is first formed on the substrate, and is then heated in a magnetic field set at a selected angle e.g. 0 or 90 to the layer. A crystalline film of the compound is formed with a major crystallographic plane aligned with the magnetic field. The substrate may be a sheet of one of the constituent metals e.g. Al, Cd or Zn , and the layer formed by impinging ions of the other metal e.g. Li onto the substrate surface. The crystalline film produced can be used as a substrate for the growth of crystalline silicon. Apparatus for performing the method includes means 105, 106 for positioning and heating 110 the substrate 104 within the magnetic field established by the magnet 101, 102 . Means 107 can also be provided for firing ions of one of the metals e.g. Li, 108 onto the substrate 104 . Similar means 113 can be provided to fire silicon 112 ions onto the crystalline film after its formation. The apparatus may be contained in a vacuum chamber.
