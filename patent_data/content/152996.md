# VELOCITY MATCHING APPARATUS

## Abstract
Velocity matching between optical signals transmitted along a light guide 13 on a lithium niobate substrate 12 and microwave signals along transmission line electrodes 16 and 17 may be improved by positioning layers of dielectric material 14 and 15 between the substrate 12 and the electrodes 16 and 17 . By improving the velocity matching the bandwidth of the device may be increased.
