# Lighting fixture and method of manufacture.

## Abstract
The fixture for housing a lamp having an elongate axis comprises an elongate housing 11 constructed from a continuous rectangular piece of sheet metal having four parallel bends therein forming planar side walls. The planar side walls 13, 15 and 17 form flange planes suitable for mating within grooves formed in suitable end pieces for the housing 11. A closure lens 25 completes the housing. The construction of the elongated housing side walls is such that a reflector sheet 27 when curvedly affixed to the two outermost planar side walls 17 is tangential to the inner three planar side walls 15 and 13 , thereby providing a parabolic reflecting surface for a lamp 12 mounted within the housing 11 . Two end wall reflectors, one of which is preferably directionally adjustable, also reflect luminous flux from the lamp. An adjustable light support for the non electrical end of the elongated lamp 12 , along with the adjustable end wall reflector, conveniently allows the light ing fixture to accept various sized elongated lamps without substantial loss of light reflecting capabilities.
