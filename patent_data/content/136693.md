## Description
Production of Cytidine Derivatives The present invention relates to a novel method of producing cytidine derivatives which are useful for example as an intermediate for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. Cytidine is an important compound as a starting material for the synthesis of cytidine diphosphate choline the general name Cyticholine being currently used as a pharmaceutical. Hitherto, there have been known a number of processes for synthesizing pyrimidine nucleosides such as cytidine through the condensation reaction between pyrimidine and sugar, and the process most customarily employed involves the condensation of silylated pyrimidine with a sugar protected with a suitable protective group J. Org. Chem. 39, 3672 3674 1974 . However, the said process suffers the disadvantages that the silyl group in the silylated pyrimidine is readily hydrolyzable with water and susceptible to the attack by moisture, and also that when an acetyl group is used as a protective group for sugar, the resulting 2 ,3 ,5 tri O acetyIcytidine exhibits solubility in water, resulting in a lowered rate 6f extraction into the organic phase in the post treatment subsequent to the reaction, and has been far from being satisfactory. The present invention overcomes the above described disadvantages pertaining to the conventional art, and provides an industrially favored process for producing cytidine derivatives. More particularly, the present invention provides a method of producing a compound of the formula EMI2.1 wherein R1 is a carboxylic acid derived acyl having not less than 3 carbon atoms, and R2, R3 and R4 each represents a carboxylic acid derived acyl, which comprises subjecting a compound of theEMI2.2 tb formula SEP NHR1 tb SEP NHR1 tb SEP N N B SEP 11 tb SEP O SEP N tb SEP H tb wherein R1 is as defined as above and a compound of the formula EMI2.3 wherein A is a group of the formula OR5 where R5 is a carboxylic acid derived acyl, or a halogen, and each ofR2, R3 and R4 is as defined as above to condensation in the presence of a Lewis acid. The carboxylic acid derived acyl having not less than 3 carbon atoms as represented by R1 in the above formulae I and 11 may be any of aliphatic or aromatic and straight chain or branched chain acy groups, and their examples include propionyl, butyryl, isobutyryl, hexanoyl, 2 ethylhexanoyl, octanoyl, decanoyl, palmitoyl and benzoyl, with alkanoyls of 3 to 16 carbon atoms, particularly 4 to 8 carbon atoms, and benzoyl being preferred. The halogen as represented by A in the above formula III may be any of fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, etc., with chlorine and bromine being particularly preferred. Preferable examples of the carboxylic acid derived acyl as represented by R2, R3 R4 and R5 include alkanoyls having a number of carbon atoms in the range of 2 to 6 and benzoyl, with the alkanoyls, especially acetyl, being particularly preferred. The condensation reaction of the compound II with the compound III is carried out in a solvent in the presence of a Lewis acid. Normally, it is advantageous to use 1 to 1.2 moles of III per mole of it . Preferred examples of the Lewis acid include metal halides such as stannic chloride, titanium tetrachloride, antimony pentachloride, aluminum chloride, ferric chloride, zinc chloride and zirconium tetrachloride, and sulfonic acid derivatives such as p toluenesulfonic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate.Preferred examples of the solvent include halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane, 1,2 dichloroethane, chloroform, 1,2 dichloropropane and 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane. The reaction conditions are preferably room temperature to 1000C 1 to 30 hours. The cytidine derivative I produced by the above procedure can be isolated from the reaction solution by conventional means such as solvent extraction and chromatography. The cytidine derivatives I obtained by the above procedure, except the compound of the formula I where 1 R2, R3 and R4 are benzoyl simultaneously, all are novel compounds which have not been described in the literature.Since these novel compounds are water insoluble and consequently can be extracted quantitatively with an organic solvent, they have the characteristic feature of being exceptionally easily purified. The cytidine derivatives I obtained by the process of the present invention can be derived into cytidine by the known alkali hydrolysis method Iplease refer for example to Journal of the Americal chemical Society , 79, 5060 1957 or analogous methods. In such a case, the said compounds I are not required to be purified and are advantageously subjected as crude product to the reaction. The compound II , which is used as a starting material in the process of the present invention, can be produced for example by the method described in Journal of the Chemical Society , 1956, 2384 or analogous methods. The compound III can be produced easily for example by the method described in Nucelic Acids Research1,1 3, 1387 1399 1976 , the method described in Journal of theAmerican Chemical Society , 79, 5060 1957 , the method described in Chemistry and industry , 1968, 547 or methods analogous to them. According to the present invention, by subjecting the compound II being stable to moisture and easy to handle and the compound III to condensation in the presence of a Lewis acid, the objective cytidine derivative I can be obtained in increased yields. The process of the present invention is industrially favored in terms of its elimination of the necessity to use mercury salts, etc. Even when the compound III where R2, R3 and R4 are acetyl simultaneously is used, furthermore, the process of the present invention offers the advantage that the resulting objective compound I , because of its being insoluble in water, can be extracted quantitatively with an organic solvent and consequently purified exceptionally easily.
