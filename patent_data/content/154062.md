# Power switching circuit.

## Abstract
A power switching circuit for switching power repetitive ly to a load at a relatively low frequency employs a power switching device 14 which is driven across an isolating transformer interface 60 . The drive signals are high fre quency pulse signals which are modulated with the low frequency switching information, the modulations being detected in the secondary circuit 62 of the transformer. Such an arrangement affords isolated driving with fast switching edges and requires only a small transformer. Power for the detection circuit is derived by rectification 120 124 of the high frequency signals induced in the transformer secondary.
