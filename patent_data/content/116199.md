# Improvements in or relating to conduit.

## Abstract
An elongate pipe 10 is connected to an elongate flange 12 by a plurality of spaced clamps 14. The pipe is suspended from the elongate flange. The clamps and the conduit have a snap in connection 22, 24 to clamp each other together and embrace the pipe between them. A drinking water supply apparatus 32 extends below the pipe and includes a nipple drinker 34 which screw threadably engages the clamp and pipe to provide a passage for the water within the pipe through the nipple. A housing 54 screw threadably engages the nipple and enclose an actuating pin 44 depending from the nipple which pin, when raised, allows water to flow from the pipe. A striker 50 extends into the housing, the striker having a water container 46 on its lower end and being supported by a compression spring 68. When the water level in the container falls below a predetermined level, the spring 68 raises the striker 50 into engagement with the pin 44 to raise the pin and allow water to flow from the pipe, through the nipple drinker and housing into the container. When the water level reaches or exceeds a predetermined level, the spring is depressed so that the striker no longer contacts the pin and water ceases to flow out of the pipe.
