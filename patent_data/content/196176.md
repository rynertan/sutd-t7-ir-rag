# Energy conserving limestone calcining system.

## Abstract
The invention is a limestone calcining process and appara tus for successive stage treatment of limestone to calcium oxide and or magnesium oxide with the use of comparatively reduced energy. The process of first and second separate suc cessive steps include heating limestone sufficiently in the first step to achieve partial conversion thereof to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide and, in the second step, independently substan tially completing the conversion of the limestone in the hot mass from the first step to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide by the retained heat and substantially in the absence of supplying further heat thereto while subjecting the mass to a vacuum. The apparatus of the invention includes a limestone calcin ing kiln 1 , a closable calcining vacuum chamber 11 provided separate from and adjacent the discharge outlet 3 of the kiln 1 for completing the conversion of the limestone to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide in a second step and a heat retaining hood mechanism 18 operatively enclosing the discharge out let 3 and the vacuum chamber 11 for minimizing heat loss.
