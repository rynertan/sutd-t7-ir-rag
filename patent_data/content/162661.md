# CARBONLESS PAPER COPYING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A color developing CF sheet for pressure sensitive re cording systems comprising an admixture of an alkylidene diphenol and calcium carbonate having a weight ratio of about 4 parts to about 12 parts phenol per 100 parts calcium carbonate. The admixture is formulated in high solids content coating colors having excellent rheological property and sta bility, which are used to produce CF sheets having a coating weight of about 4 to about 10 g mâ‚‚. Preferably, the CF sheet comprises Bisphenol A in an amount of 4 to 10 parts per 100 parts calcium carbonate and the calcium carbonate weight in the CF coating is greater than 50 . Other embodiments comprise an aqueous dispersion of the admixture and a pres sure sensitive recording manifold.
