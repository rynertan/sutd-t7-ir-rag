# WOVEN FABRIC MADE FROM UNSIZED CARBON FIBER MULTIFILAMENTARY YARN BUNDLES

## Abstract
An improved woven fabric made from unsized carbon fiber multifilamentary tow is provided which possesses a novel physical configuration that better enables it to undergo impregnation with a matrix forming resin to form quality composite articles. The individual filaments of the tow are randomly decollimated and commingled with numerous fila ment cross over points throughout the length of the multifi lamentary tow in order to create a multitude of interstices between adjacent filaments which are well adapted to receive and retain a matrix forming resin as evidenced by the ability of the filaments when subjected to the flaring test described herein to resist lateral expansion to a width that is as much as one and one half times the original width. The multifilamen tary bundles have been found to be capable of being readily woven with no significant productivity loss to form a quality reinforcing fabric while free of a protective size.
