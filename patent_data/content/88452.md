# MATERIAL HANDLING SYSTEM

## Abstract
A material handling system of the monorail and crane type that is adaptable to carry relatively heavy loads and light loads through convenient structural modification using common component parts. The system is comprised of a double track 40 for heavy loads, formed of two track parts 54, 55 that alone are suitable for light load applications. Carriers 42, 204 are comprised of drive heads 74 and idler heads 78, each with a single load support wheel 70, 71 or 70 , 71 . A drive head 74, 74 and an idler head 78,78 can be releasably interconnected in tandem by a load bar 206 to run along a single track, or in face to face opposition with wheels 70, 71 coaxial to form a drive unit 44 adapted to run along a double track. In the latter arrangement two additional heads, such as two idler heads 78b, 78c, are also interconnected in face to face opposition to form an idler unit 46 and connected in tandem with the drive unit 44 by a load bar 52.
