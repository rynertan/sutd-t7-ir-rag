# High thermal conductivity aluminum nitride ceramic body.

## Abstract
A process for producing a polycrystalline aluminium nitride ceramic body having a composition defined and encompassed by line ABCDEFA but not including lines CD and EF, a porosity of less than about 10 by volume of said body and a thermal conductivity greater than 1.0 W cm K at 22 C which comprises forming a mixture comprised of aluminium nitride powder and an yttrium addi tive selected from the group consisting of yttrium, yttrium hydride, yttrium nitride and mixtures thereof, said alumi nium nitride and yttrium additive having a predetermined oxygen content, said mixture having a composition wherein the equivalent of yttrium, aluminium nitrogen and oxy gen is defined and encompassed by line ABCDEFA but not including lines CD and EF, shaping said mixture into a compact and sintering said compact at a temperature ranging from about 1850 C to about 2170 C in an atmo sphere selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, argon, hydrogen and mixtures thereof to produce said polycrystal line body.
