# Acid capped polyester resins.

## Abstract
A polyester resin having a low intrinsic viscosity and suitable for use as a powdered resin is modified by being capped with organic acids. The resins are made from the reaction of diesters with diols with up to 30 mole percent of the diester being replaced with various diacide. The polyes ter is capped following the condensation reaction stage, but before any finishing stage. The polyester resins have an acid number of from 1 to 100 and allow greater flexibility in the type of acid functionality than previously available.
