## Description
This invention relates to PCM pulse code modulated apparatus and, in particular, to apparatus which is suitable for recording and or reproducing a PCM audio signal, and which provides aperture compensation. When a PCM audio signal is reproduced by conventional recording and or reproducing apparatus, the high frequency portion of the reproduced sound deteriorates because of the holding operation of the D A digital to analog converter employed. This is generally known as the aperture effect . In other words, since it takes a certain length of time for the output voltage from the D A converter to reach the correct value corresponding to the input digital signal, the waveform of the signal from the D A converter is distorted, as explained below. Even if the reproduced digital signal is supplied to the D A converter during a sampling period, it takes a certain length of time for the output of the D A converter to become stabilized. An aperture compensation circuit for compensating for the deterioration of the high frequency portion of the reproduced signal is thus indispensable to the optimal functioning of a PCM audio reproducing system. However, the prior art does not provide such compensation in an optimal manner. In particular, in the prior art, a special circuit for effecting aperture compensation is employed but because of the addition of this special circuit, the manufacturing cost of the PCM apparatus is higher than is desirable. This disadvantage would be overcome by PCM signal recording and or reproducing apparatus, which is capable of aperture compensation but does not require a special aperture compensation circuit, so that the circuitry of the apparatus is simplified and the manufacturing cost is low. According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided pulse code modulated signal apparatus having a recording mode and a reproducing mode and providing aperture compensation of reproduced and digital to analog converted and comprising a digital to analog converter for receiving a reproduced digital input signal in said reproducing mode and producing an analog output signal comprising distortions of a high frequency signal component at least one recording input terminal for receiving an, or a respective, input signal to be recorded switch means having an armature operable selectively to connect the at least one recording input terminal or the analog output signal to a recording section, the recording section incorporating filter means for filtering signals passed through the switch means and circuitry operable in the recording mode for producing a PCM signal to be recorded from a signal input to that one of said recording input terminals selected by the switch means control means for controlling said switch means in said recording mode to select said at least one input signal and in said reproducing mode to select said analog output signal to be applied to said filter means the armature of the switch means being additionally selectively operable to connect its output to a source of a predetermined voltage level and a control means being operable in the reproducing mode to alternately connect the input of the filter means to the predetermined voltage level and to the analog output signal, thereby to effect aperture compensation. It may be noted that EP A 0109674 discloses the use of a single analogue filter which is switched between a number of digital channels, though there the switching is between signals being read from a number of parallel digital signal tracks, rather than for the purpose of selecting whether to process a signal to be recorded or one being reproduced. IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol 21, No 8, Jan. 1979, p. 3285 3286 describes aperture compensation switching transient compensation in combination with digital to analog converters.

Fig. 1 is a circuit block diagram showing, as background to the present invention, an example of a prior art PCM audio signal recording and or reproducing apparatus including an aperture compensation circuit. In Fig. 1, a first input signal, such as a microphone output, is applied to an input terminal 1 a second input signal, such as a line output from a tuner or the like, is applied to a second input terminal 2 and a third input signal, such as a television audio signal, is applied to an input terminal 3. The input terminals are not limited to these three terminals 1, 2 and 3 but may include other terminals provided for the purpose of receiving other desired input signals. The input terminals 1, 2 and 3 are respectively connected to contacts A recording mode and or reproducing playback mode changeover switch 5 is provided at the output side of the switch 4. When the movable contact arm of the switch 5 is connected to the contact R, the apparatus is set in the recording mode and when the movable contact arm of the switch 5 is connected to the contact P, the apparatus is set in the playback mode. In the recording mode, the signal from the switch 5 is supplied through an LPF low pass filter 6 to an A D analog to digital converter 7 and thereby converted from an analog signal to a digital signal. A noise reduction circuit not shown may be provided between the low pass filter 6 and the A D converter 7. The low pass filter 6 serves during recording to remove noise caused by sidebands that are produced by the A D conversion, and during playback to extract only the baseband signal. The signal from the A D converter 7 is supplied to an encoder 8, in which it undergoes necessary signal processing, such as addition of an error correction code, interleaving, time base compression and the like, and is then fed through a recording amplifier not shown to a recording head 9 and thereby recorded on a tape 10 that is provided as a recording medium. In the playback mode, the signal reproduced from the tape 10 by a reproducing head 11 is supplied through a playback amplifier not shown to a decoder 12 in which it undergoes necessary signal processing, such as error detection, error correction, de interleaving, time base expansion and the like. The signal from the decoder 12 is supplied to a D A digital to analog converter 13, which converts the signal from digital to analog form. An aperture compensation circuit 14 compensates for the deterioration of the high frequency portion of the reconverted analog signal. The compensated signal is fed through the contact P of the switch 5 and the low pass filter 6 and supplied at an output terminal 15 as a monitor output. A control signal generating circuit 16 is provided which supplies control signals to the A D converter 7, the encoder 8, the decoder 12 and the D A converter 13, respectively. If the aperture compensation circuit 14 is formed of a switch system as described below, it is supplied with a control signal switching signal from the control signal generating circuit 16, as indicated by a broken line in Fig. 1. The aperture compensation circuit 14 typically comprises Fig. 2 a filter including an amplifier 14a by which the deteriorated component of the high frequency portion of the output of the D A converter 13 is boosted as shown, for example, by a two dot chain line Alternatively, as shown in Fig. 4, the aperture compensation circuit 14 comprises a switch 14b connected between the D A converter 13 and the contact P of the switch 5, and the common contact or movable contact arm of the switch 14b is connected to the contact P of the switch 5. A contact While in the case of the aperture compensation circuit 14 shown in Fig. 4, deterioration of the high frequency portion of the reduced signal can be compensated for by employing the switching signal It is also apparent that, in the prior art, a special circuit for effecting aperture compensation is required. This increases the complexity of the apparatus, so that the manufacturing cost is higher than is desirable.

In the playback mode, the contact In this embodiment of the invention also, it is possible to achieve the aperture compensation described above in the case of the first and second embodiments of the invention. Thus there is provided in accordance with the novel and highly effective pulse code modulated signal apparatus wherein the input signal changeover switch or such switch and the recording changeover switch provide aperture compensation without the addition of any special aperture compensation circuitry. The circuitry is accordingly simplified and can be manufactured at reduced cost.
