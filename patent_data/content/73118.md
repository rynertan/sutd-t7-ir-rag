# IMPROVEMENTS IN OR RELATING TO THE MANUFACTURE OF SPRING MATTRESSES

## Abstract
A spring mattress has a structure including a spring carcass 1 on each face of which there is disposed a composite layer including a fiber padding layer 3 , an intermediate foamed layer 5,24A,24B and a felt padding layer 7 , the whole of which is disposed in a cloth cover 9 . The foamed layers 5 are formed by introducing the reactant materials into a laminar space defined between the respec tive padding layers 20,22,3,7 and dividing the foamed layer 24 so formed to separate the respective composite layers. An apparatus for forming the mattress includes two endless conveyors 11,13 for feeding the padding layers 20,22,7 which together define a laminar space in which the foamed layer 24,5 is formed, and a nozzle device 19 to inject into the laminar space the reacting components which form the foam.
