## Abstract
A high voltage power supply used to transfer three phase a.c. energy to d.c. at full rated power over a large range of out put voltages. The electric and magnetic circuits are arranged according to the core type of construction wherein three legs 16, 17, 18 of the iron core 15 extend axially and have the pri mary coil 19 21 wound along their full length. The core legs are joined for magnetic circuit continuity at the extremities. A plurality of high voltage decks 25 36 each having three secondary winding modules mounted and interconnected are stacked axially over the axially extending iron core pieces. The secondary coils on each high voltage deck are interconnected in several three phase connections, to produce a phase shift in the ripple of the d.c. output voltage of the various decks. A high voltage bridge rectification circuit mounted on each deck produces full wave rectification of the output. Each high volta ge deck provides a contact 37, 38 which is engaged selecti vely by contacts 39, 40 mounted on an axially extending rota ry switch 41 whose angular position varies the interconnec tions of the high voltage decks to produce a range of output voltages at the full rated power of the transformer. A counter balance circuit to reduce any residual voltage ripple compo nent at multiples of the input frequency includes the applica tion of an a.c. voltage of proper phase and amplitude supplied at the ground return lead 206 of the series parallel connected high voltage decks. The counterbalance voltage is applied by way of an additional secondary winding of a few turns 207 209 coiled over the three legs of the transformer core, but is completely independent of the primary and secondary wind ings. The number of turns of the additional winding and the leg from which the voltage is taken are determined empirically.
