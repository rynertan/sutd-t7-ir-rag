# SYNTHESIS OF DIOXABICYCLO 3.2.1 OCTANES AND OXEPANES

## Abstract
The synthesis of C 4 alkyl analogs of racemic 1RS,4SR,5RS 4 4,8 dimethyl 5 hydroxy 7 nonenyl 4 methyl 3,8 dioxabicyclo 3.2.1 octane 1 acetic acid and the corresponding 1RS,4RS,5RS derivative is described. The dioxabicyclo 3.2.1 octanes are useful as contragestational agents. The intermediate oxepane analogs are useful as intermediates in the preparation of the contragestational agent zoapatanol.
