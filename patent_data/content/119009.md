# A device for determining the speed, distance traversed, elapsed time and calories expended by a person while running.

## Abstract
A device for measuring the speed of a person while running along a surface is disclosed. A pressure switch or transducer 3 located in a shoe senses when a foot of the runner is in contact with the surface and produces a foot contact signal having a duration proportional to the time the foot is in contact with the surface. A radio frequency transmitter 1 is coupled to the pressure switch or transduc er 3 and transmits the foot contact signal. A radio frequency receiver 4 receives the foot contact signal transmitted by the frequency transmitter 1 and a microprocessor 5 coupled to the radio frequency receiver 4 calculates, solely from the foot contact signal, an output speed signal repre senting the speed of the runner. A liquid crystal display 7 coupled to the output of the microprocessor 5 displays the speed of the runner in accordance with the output speed signal.
