## Abstract
A wire rope or cable stabilizing system 140, 140 , 141, 142 for applying a balancing force to a suspended load 110 to maintain vertical movement of the load 110 , perpendicu lar to the surface upon which the load is to be placed. The balancing force is effected to balance the lateral loading forces which may be applied to the suspended load such as may be due to, for example, the list or trim of a vessel, or the wind loading forces encountered when removing or replac ing a hatch cover 110 during a loading or unloading operation of a ship.
