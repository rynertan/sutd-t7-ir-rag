# A rolling seal sluice gate.

## Abstract
A sluice gate including a closure member 5 com prising a sheet 6 of flexible fabric reinforced polymeric material having pairs of reinforcing members 8, 9 extending horizontally across the sheet 6 with one member of each pair located on the upstream side and the other on the downstream side of the sheet 6 in use. The pairs of members 8, 9 are secured together with the flexible sheet 6 between them and at least some of the members 8 on the upstream side extend beyond the side edges of the sluice opening 2 to be controlled and those 9 on the downstream side are able to pass into the sluice opening 2 . The sluice gate includes control means 12, 13 for drawing the lower end of the closure member 5 upwardly and away from the opening 2 to progressively open it and to allow the closure member 5 to return progressively to the closed position.
