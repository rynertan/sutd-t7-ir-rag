# AN INSTRUMENT FOR REMOVING PERMANENTLY CEMENTED FULL VENEER DENTAL CROWNS FROM POSTERIOR TEETH

## Abstract
The instrument comprises a U shaped yoke 10 for straddling the buccal and lingual surfaces of a crown 36 , an operating screw 14 co operating with the threaded bore 9 formed in the central portion 13 of the yoke. The limbs 11,12 of the U shaped yoke are bifurcated and between each bifurcated limb, crown engaging members 18,19 are mounted on pivots 20,21 . The crown engaging members are formed with frictional crown engaging surfaces 28,29 of progressively increasing radius as indicated by lines a,b,c . In operation, a hole 35 is drilled in the centre of the crown 36 . The instrument is placed in the position shown in Figure 1 and the operating screw 14 is rotated to cause the end 16 to pass through the hole 35 and engage the tooth 37 . Further torque applied to the screw 14 causes the surfaces 28,29 to lock against the crown at the same time as causing the yoke to move upwards thus removing the crown from the tooth.
