# Steering force controlling apparatus for power steering system.

## Abstract
An apparatus for electronically controlling the steering force needed to operate the handle of a vehicle, according to the velocity of the vehicle and the angular displacement of the handle. The apparatus includes a memory for storing various characteristic maps of different steering characteristics, a se lecting switch for selecting one of these maps, and a control circuit for applying the electric current depending on the se lected map to the solenoid of a flow control means which con trols the pressure flow supplied to the power cylinder of a pow er steering system.
