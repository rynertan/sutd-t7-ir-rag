# Weld neck flange for a valve or the like and method of manufacture.

## Abstract
A pipe flange with a heavy welding neck is hot formed from a circular section of steel plate 60 having a small co axial hole 62 in the center. The steel around the hole 62 is shear formed downward and outward by a tapered die plug 67 which is forced through the small hole 62 forming an integral neck on the flange. A supporting ring die 63 is radiused 65 at its inner corner 66 to form a suitable fillet radius at the junction of the neck with the flange proper. A suitable preforming or post forming operation may be required to compensate for any deflection in the workpiece out of planar configuration.
