# Large swing driver receiver circuit.

## Abstract
Low voltage, low power transistor driver receiver and logic circuits are disclosed comprising a pair of NPN transistors 1, 2 , the base of the first transistor 1 being directly connected to an input terminal 8 and, via a resistor R₀ , to the base of the second transistor 2 . A third NPN transistor 3 is connected with the second transistor 2 in series circuit across a low voltage power supply. The junction between the series connected transistors is coupled to an output terminal 5 . A diode 6 is connected between a point on the resistor R₀ and the collector of the second transistor 2 to prevent saturation. The emitter of the second transistor 2 is connected through a small or zero resistance to one terminal 4 of the power supply. The down level at the output terminal 5 is held by a transistor or diode clamp 7 connected between the base of the third transistor 3 and the other terminal 11 of the power supply.
