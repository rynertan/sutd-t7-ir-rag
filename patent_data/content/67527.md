# Improvements in or relating to measuring probes.

## Abstract
A clip on probe for measuring electric currents by operation of the Hall effect comprises a ring of magnetisable material, at least part of which is mounted in a set of opposed jaws 4, 5 . The jaws are movable between an open position in which the jaws can be placed over a conductor and a closed position in which the jaws meet around the conductor and the ring is substantially complete. To facilitate removal of the probe when a heavy current is flowing through a conductor between the jaws, the jaws are provided with an opening mechanism with an actuator 7 so con structed and arranged that initial pressure on the actuator urges the jaws 4, 5 apart from the closed position at a first mechanical advantage and, after an initial movement of the actuator, subsequent pressure urges the jaws towards the fully open position at a second lower mechanical advantage.
