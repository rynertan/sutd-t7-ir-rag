EMI40.1 The present invention includes novel intermediates of formula I to XXVI The compounds of formula I, and compositions containing them, are variously active against a wide range of fungal diseases, particularly, for example, against Plasmopara viticola downy mildew on vines and Phytophthora infestans late blight on potatoes and tomatoes and other species of Phytophthora.Other downy mildews, powdery mildews and other fungal and bacterial diseases, for example Venturia inaequalis scab on apples Pyricularia oryzae on rice Cercospora arachidicola on peanuts and other Cercospora species Xanthomonas oryzae on rice.Some of the compounds have also shown a broad range of activities against fungi in vitro. They have activity against various pathogens which cause post harvest diseases of fruit eg. Penicillium digatatum and italicum on oranges and Gloeosporium musarum on bananas . The compounds can move acropetally in the plant tissue. The compounds may be used as such for fungicidal purposes but are more conveniently formulated into compositions for such usage. The invention thus provides a fungicidal composition comprising a compound of general formula I as hereinbefore defined, and, optionally, a carrier or diluent. The invention also provides a method of combating fungi, which comprises applying to a plant, to seed of a plant, or to the locus of the plant or seed, a compound as hereinbefore defined, or a composition containing the same. The compounds, can be applied in a number of ways, for example they can be applied, formulated or unformulated, directly to the foliage of a plant, or they can be applied also to bushes and trees, to seeds or to other medium in which plants, bushes or trees are growing or are to be planted, or they can be sprayed on, dusted on or applied as a cream or paste formulation, or they can be applied as a vapour or as slow release granules. Application can be to any part of the plant, bush or tree, for example to the foliage, stems, branches or roots, or to soil surrounding the roots, or to the seed before it is planted or to the soil generally, to paddy water or to hydroponic culture systems. The invention compounds may also be injected into plants or trees and they may also be sprayed onto vegetation using electrodynamic spraying techniques. The term plant as used herein includes seedlings, bushes and trees. Furthermore, the fungicidal method of the invention includes preventative, protectant, prophylactic and eradicant treatment. The compounds are preferably used for agricultural and horticultural purposes in the form of a composition. The type of composition used in any instance will depend upon the particular purpose envisaged. The compositions may be in the form of dusting powders or granules comprising the active ingredient and a solid diluent or carrier, for example fillers such as kaolin, bentonite, kieselguhr, dolomite, calcium carbonate, talc, powdered magnesia, Fuller s earth, gypsum, Hewitt s earth, diatomaceous earth and China clay. Such granules can be preformed granules suitable for application to the soil without further treatment. These granules can be made either by impregnating pellets of filler with the active ingredient or by pelleting a mixture of the active ingredient and powdered filler.Compositions for dressing seed, for example, may comprise an agent for example a mineral oil for assisting the adhesion of the composition to the seed alternatively the active ingredient can be formulated for seed dressing purposes using an organic solvent for example N methylpyrrolidone or dimethylformamide . The compositions may also be in the form of dispersible powders, granules or grains comprising a wetting agent to facilitate the dispersion in liquids of the powder or grains which may contain also fillers and suspending agents. The aqueous dispersions or emulsions may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient s in an organic solvent optionally containing wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent s and then adding the mixture to water which may also contain wetting, dispersing or emulsifying agent s . Suitable organic solvents are ethylene dichloride, isopropyl alcohol, propylene glycol, diacetone alcohol, toluene, kerosene, methylnaphthalene, the xylenes, trichloroethylene, furfuryl alcohol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, and glycol ethers eg. 2 ethoxyethanol and 2butoxyethanol . The compositions to be used as sprays may also be in the form of aerosols wherein the formulation is held in a container under pressure in the presence of a propellant, eg. fluorotrichloromethane or dichlorodifluoromethane. The compounds can be mixed in the dry state with a pyrotechnic mixture to form a composition suitable for generating in enclosed spaces a smoke containing the compounds. Alternatively, the compounds may be used in a microencapsulated form. They may also be formulated in biodegradable polymeric formulations to obtain a slow, controlled release of the active substance. By including suitable additives, for example additives for improving the distribution, adhesive power and resistance to rain on treated surfaces, the different compositions can be better adapted for various utilities. The compounds can be used as mixtures with fertilisers eg. nitrogen , potassium or phosphorus containing fertilisers . Compositions comprising only granules of fertiliser incorporating, for example coated with, the compound are preferred. Such granules suitably contain up to 25 by weight of the compound. The invention therefore also provides a fertiliser composition comprising the compound of general formula I or a salt or metal complex thereof. The compositions may also be in the form of liquid preparations for use as dips or sprays which are generally aqueous dispersions or emulsions containing the active ingredient in the presence of one or more surfactants eg.wetting agent s , dispersing agent s , emulsifying agent s or suspending agent s or which are spray formulations of the kind suitable for use in electrodynamic spraying techniques. The foregoing agents can be cationic, anionic or non ionic agents. Suitable cationic agents are quaternary ammonium compounds, for example cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. Suitable anionic agents are soaps, salts of aliphatic monoesters of sulphuric acid for example sodium lauryl sulphate , and salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds for example sodium dodecylbenzenesulphonate, sodium, calcium or ammonium lignosulphonate, butylnaphthalene sulphonate, and a mixture of sodium diisopropyl and triisopropylnaphthalene sulphonates . Suitable non ionic agents are the condensation products of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols such as oleyl or cetyl alcohol, or with alkyl phenols such as octyl or nonyl phenol and octylcresol. Other non ionic agents are the partial esters derived from long chain fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, the condensation products of the said partial esters with ethylene oxide, and the lecithins. Suitable suspending agents are hydrophilic colloids for example polyvinylpyrrolidone and sodium cart oxymethylcellulose , and the vegetable gums for example gum acacia and gum tragacanth . The compositions for use as aqueous dispersions or emulsions are generally supplied in the form of a concentrate containing a high proportion of the active ingredient s , and the concentrate is to be diluted with water before use. These concentrates often should be able to withstand storage for prolonged periods and after such storage be capable of dilution with water in order to form aqueous preparations which remain homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional and electrodynamic spray equipment. The concentrates may conveniently contain up to 95 , suitably 10 85 , for example 25 60 , by weight of the active ingredient s .These concentrates suitably contain organic acids eg. alkaryl or aryl sulphonic acids such as xylenesulphonic acid or dodecyl benzenesulphonic acid since the presence of such acids can increase the solubility of the active ingredients in the polar solvents often used in the concentrates. The concentrates suitably contain also a high proportion of surfactants so that sufficiently stable emulsions in water can be obtained. After dilution to form aqueous preparations, such preparations may contain varying amounts of the active ingredient s depending upon the intended purpose, but an aqueous preparation containing 0.0005 or 0.018 to 10 by weight of active ingredient s may be used. The compositions of this invention can comprise also other compound s having biological activity eg. compounds having similar or complementary fungicidal activity or which possess plant growth regulating, or insecticidal activity. The other fungicidal compound can be, for example, one which is capable of combating ear diseases of cereals eg.wheat such as Septoria, Gibberella and Helminthosporium spp., seed and soil borne diseases and downy and powdery mildews on grapes and powdery mildew and scab on apple etc.These mixtures of fungicides can have a broader spectrum of activity than the compound of general formula I alone further the other fungicide can have a synergistic effect on the fungicidal activity of the compound of general formula I . Examples of the other fungicidal compound are imazalil, benomyl, carbendazim, thiophanate methyl, captafol, captan, sulphur, triforine, dodemorph, tridemorph, pyrazophos, furalaxyl, ethirimol, tecnazene, dimethirimol, bupirimate, chlorothalonil, vinclozolin, procymidone, iprodione, metalaxyl, fosetyl aluminium, carboxin, oxycarboxin, fenarimol, nuarimol, fenfuram, methfuroxam, nitrotal isopropyl, triadimefon, flutriafol, thiabendazole, etridiazole, triadimenol, biloxazol, dithianon, binapicryl, quinomethionate, guazatine, dodine, fentin acetate, fentin hydroxide, dinocap, folpet, dichlofluanid, ditalimphos, kitazin, cycloheximide, diclobutrazol, a dithiocarbarnate, a copper compound, a mercury compound, l 2 cyano 2 methoxyiminoacetyl 3 ethyl urea, fenapanil, ofurace, propiconazole, etaconazole and fenpropemorph, fenpropidine, topas, oxadixyl and prochloraz.

For all tests the plants were grown in John InnesPotting Compost No. 1 or 2 in 4 cm diameter minipots.The test compounds were formulated either by bead milling with aqueous Dispersol T or as a solution in acetone or acetone ethanol which was diluted to the required concentration immediately before use. The solutions or suspensions 100 ppm ia. were sprayed on the foliage and applied to the roots of the plant via the soil. The sprays were applied to maximum retention and the root drenches to a final concentration equivalent to approximately 40 ppm ai. dry soil. TWEEN 20, to give a final concentration of 0.05 , was added when the sprays were applied to cereals. a.i. means active ingredient . The word TWEEN is aTrade Mark. Most were protectant tests where the compound was applied to the soil and roots and to the foliage one or two days before the plant was inoculated with the pathogen.The foliar pathogens were applied by spraying as spore suspensions onto the leaves of the test plants. After inoculation, the plants were placed in an appropriate environment to allow infection to proceed and then incubated until the disease was ready for assessment.The period between inoculation and assessment varied from four to fourteen days according to the disease and the environment. Disease control was recorded using the following grading system 4 no disease 3 trace to 5 of disease on untreated plants 2 6 25 of disease on untreated plants 1 26 59 of disease on untreated plants 0 60 100 of disease on untreated plantsThe results are shown in Table III.
