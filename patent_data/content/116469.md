# Process for the conversion of a C2 to C10 aliphatic linear olefin to a product comprising hydrocarbons of higher carbon number.

## Abstract
C₂ to C₁₀, preferably C₃ to C₆, aliphatic linear olefins are converted to a product comprising at least one hydrocarbon of higher carbon number selected from dimers, oligomers, alkanes, olefins and aromatics by contacting the olefin at elevated temperature with a catalyst comprising a cation exchangeable layered clay.
