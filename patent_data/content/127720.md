# IMPROVEMENTS IN A PIECE HOLDER TABLE REVOLVING INTERMITTENTLY IN MACHINE TOOLS

## Abstract
The improvement consists in providing in the table 1 revolving intermittently and carrying on its periphery piece holder grips, central openings 11 , which make possible the discharge of working shavings and wastes at the centre of the table itself arrow 12 and not at the periphery arrows 7,7 as now is done. This makes possible direct discharge of the working shav ings and wastes in the collection container underneath and avoids clogging and stopping of the machine for cleaning which requires the presence of additional labor and limits production.
