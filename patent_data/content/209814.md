## Description
The present invention relates to 1 ethyl 6 fluoro 1,4 dihydro 4 keto 7 trimethylolmethylamino quinoline 3 carboxylic acid, of formula I The present invention relates also to a process for preparing compound I or salts thereof, and to pharmaceuti cal compositions having antibacterial activity, said com positions containing compound I or the salts thereof as the active ingredient. Compounds being structurally similar to the compo und according to the present invention are known particu larly norfloxacin, i.e. 1 ethyl 6 fluoro 1,4 dihydro 4 oxo 7 1 piperazinyl quinoline 3 carboxylic acid, describ ed in Belgian Patent No. 870,917, is a well known antibac terial agent, which is widely used in human therapy, main ly in the treatment of urinary infections. However norfloxacin, though showing a remarkable antibacterial activity, suffers from pharmacokinetic re strictions poor adsorption and bioavailability . It has now been found that compound I, hereinafter defined YS 260 for sake of shortness, besides showing activity ant antibacterial spectrum substantially superim posable to those of norfloxacin, has remarkably better pharmacokinetic characteristics. Particularly, after admi nistration of the above drugs in equimolecular dosages, higher hematic rates and accordingly a better bioavailabi lity were evidenced for YS 260. The better bioavailability of YS 260 allows to obtain the same therapeutic effectiveness of norfloxacin at reduced doses and accordingly an improved therapeutic index. The plasmatic peak of YS 260 occurs about 90 minu tes after the administration, in a 22.51 Âµg ml maximum concentration, which is about 5 times higher than that obtained for similar quinolinone antibacterials. Therefore YS 260 or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof will be used as antibacterial drugs, parti cularly in the treatment of urinary infections cystitis, pyelitis, cystopyelitis, pyelonephritis , by oral, paren teral or rectal administration, in form of such appropria te pharmaceutical compositions as capsules, tablets, su gar coated pills, dragees, granulates, packets, syrups, solutions, injectable steril solutions, suppositories, etc. Said dosage forms will contain therapeutically effective amounts of the active ingredient, in admixture with appropriate carriers, excipients, binding agents, preservatives, stabilizers, flavours, etc. traditionally used in pharmaceutical techniques. The daily dosage will vary, depending upon patholo gy and conditions of the patient weight, age, sex, etc. it will generally range from 200 to 1000 mg, divided in 1 4 administrations. Therefore, unitary dosage forms will contain 100 to 500 mg of active ingredient. The present invention also provides a process for preparing compound I, by reacting tris hydroxymethylami nomethane and 1 ethyl 6 fluoro 1,4 dihydro 4 oxo 7 chloro quinoline 3 carboxylic acid which is a per se known com pound in aprotic solvents, such as dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide, in case in the pre sence of catalytic amounts of NaI. The reaction will be preferably carried out with an excess of tris hydroxyme thylaminomethane, at the reflux temperature of the sol vent, for 12 24 hours. The following Example further illustrates the invention, without limiting it. 300 Mg of 1 ethyl 6 fluoro 1,4 dihydro 4 keto 7 chloro quinoline 3 carboxylic acid was dissolved in 15 ml of dimethylformamide. 3 g of tri hydroxymethylaminomethane was added to the solution, which was refluxed for 16 hours, adding catalytic amounts of NaI. The reaction was checked by TLC, eluent THF ammonium hydroxide 25 98 2 , UV light the spot of the chloroderivative disappears, while a new spot is evidenced, less eluted, fluorescent at 364 nm. When the reaction was complete, the mixture was dried under vacuum, treated with acetic acid to adjust pH to 5, cooled to 0 C and filtered. After crystallization at least 2 times from etha nol water, cooling to 0 C before filtration, compound I was obtained, melting at 244 C, in a 25 yield.
