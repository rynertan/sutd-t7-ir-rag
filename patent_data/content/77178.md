# System for controlling motors for synchronous operating.

## Abstract
There is disclosed a system for controlling a plurality of motors 13a, 14a, 15a including a spindle motor 13a of a ma chine tool to rotate synchronously at command speeds. The system comprises a numerical control unit 12 for generating as positional commands trains of distributed pulses having fre quencies corresponding to commanded speeds of rotation re spectively for the motors, positional control feedback circuits PFS, PFW, PFB respectively for the motors for producing speed command outputs from the trains of distributed pulses and detected signals indicative of positions of the motors, and speed control feedback circuits VFS, VFW, VFB respectively for the motors for controlling the speed of the motors based on the speed command outputs and detected signals indica tive of speeds of rotation of the motors.
