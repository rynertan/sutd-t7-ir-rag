# RC active filters.

## Abstract
Second and third order RC active filter sections are described both based on a similar basic twin tee network. The circuits include a single operational amplifier 1 and are such that the poles and zeros of the network can be adjusted with little interaction by varying resistances Ra, Rb, Rc, Rg, Rh, Rp in sequence. It is possible to construct the sections using capacitors of wide tolerance.
