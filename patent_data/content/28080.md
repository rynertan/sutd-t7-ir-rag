# Method for maintaining para selectivity of modified zeolite catalyst.

## Abstract
A method for prolonging the useful life of para selective odified zeolite catalysts, said zeolites having a silica to alumi na mole ratio of at least about 12, a constraint index of about 1 12 and having been modified by the addition thereto of a minor proportion of a difficultly reducible oxide. The selective catalyst is maintained at temperatures of at least about 50 C or, alter natively, in an atmosphere substantially free of moisture.
