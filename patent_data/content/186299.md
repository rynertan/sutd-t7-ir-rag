# Optical amplifier.

## Abstract
An optical signal pulse to be amplified and a pump signal pulse are launched consecutively into one end of an optical fibre, which may comprise a separate fibre or part of a transmission line. The pulses differ in wavelength by one or more Stokes shift and the order of launch is determined by the relevant group velocities in the fibre. Owing to dispersion in the fibre the pulses overlap and overtake one another while they are transmitted along the fibre, the signal pulse being amplified as a result of Raman stimulated emission and compressed as a result of power depletion from the pump pulse, thus increasing the bandwidth of the transmis sion line.
