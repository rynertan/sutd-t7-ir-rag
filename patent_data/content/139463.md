# Electromagnetic feeder drive control apparatus.

## Abstract
An electromagnetic feeder drive control apparatus in cludes a drive control circuit 4 composed of a microcompu ter for producing a timing signal to control the on off timing of a switching element 3 on the basis of a signal produced by a sensor 11 upon sensing that the power supply voltage has crossed a value of zero. A photocoupler 12 is inter posed between the sensor 11 and the drive control circuit 4 , and between the drive control circuit 4 and the switching element 3 . Disadvantages of prior control appar atus relying upon a CR time constant circuit can thereby be avoided.
