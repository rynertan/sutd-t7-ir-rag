# High strength and toughness steel bar, rod and wire and the process of producing the same.

## Abstract
Wire rods containing an adequate quantity of C within the range from 0.70 to 1.00 , Si from 0.5 to 3.0 , Mn from 0.30 to 2.0 , Cr from 0.10 to 0.5 , Al from 0.030 to 0.10 and N from 0.004 to 0.015 and unavoidable impurities, and with Fe for all the rest are subjected to re heat patenting to increase the tensile strength to 135 kgf mmÂ² or higher, then are drawn by adequately slecting the conditions, number of times of drawing in the range from 7 to 16 times, drawing speed from 50 to 500m minute, extent of drawing from 70 90, and water cooling immediately after each drawing to manufacture steel wires of high strength and high tough ness. The wires are used as PC wires, steel wires for skewed bridge cables, steel stranded wires, spring wires, main cable wires for extra long suspension bridge large diameter wires for core of aluminium cables steel reinforced transmission cable , and as galvanized steel wires for such applications.
