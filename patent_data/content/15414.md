# Welding flux closed loop system.

## Abstract
Granulated welding flux is supplied under fluid pressure from a reservoir mounted at a convenient location for reload ing. The reservoir is connected to an elected vacuum tank. Recovered excess flux is also brought up to the vacuum tank, both sources of flux maintaining a predetermined level of flux within the vacuum tank. A conduit from the vacuum tank pro vides gravity feed of flux from the tank to a lower divide box from which a plurality of conduits deliver flux to the traveling welding arc from behind and in front of the arc between the tip of the welding electrode and the work piece.
