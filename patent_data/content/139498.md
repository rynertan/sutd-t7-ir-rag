# Process for the hydroxylation of olefins using molecular oxygen, an osmium containing catalyst, a copper co catalyst, and an aromatic amine based promoter.

## Abstract
A process directed to the hydroxylation of olefins by reacting said olefins in the presence of oxygen, water, and a catalyst composition comprising i a catalytically active osmium containing compound, ii a Co catalyst I comprising a copper containing compound such as CuBrâ‚‚, and iii a Co catalyst II capable of increasing the rate and or selectivity of the hydroxylation reaction, such as pyridine is disclosed.
