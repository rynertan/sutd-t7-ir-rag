# Phase controlled regulated power supply circuit.

## Abstract
A circuit is provided for regulating the application of pow er to a load 30 which is relatively insensitive to rapid power fluctuation of the type exemplified by typical AC line sources. In one embodiment, an AC line source 10 is applied through a rectifier 20 at a controlled rate to a tungsten lamp 30 whose operation is controlled by a transistor switching network 40 . The transistor operation, in turn, is controlled by comparing AC a portion of the rectified signal with a signal from 50 pro portional to the light output of the lamp 30 .
