# Apparatus for automatically inspecting electrical connecting pins.

## Abstract
An automatic pin inspection 100 apparatus and method in spects a plurality of pins 27 that are arranged in a predeter mined configuration such as parallel rows and converts the im age of the pins to a digital signal for application to a computer system 11, 17. The digital signal is compared with a known reference stored in a memory within the digital computer sys tem 11, 17 and units 5 that do not meet specified tolerances are rejected. A conveyer mechanism 10 ensures the automa tion of the process. A centering technique is implemented and compensates for the jittering due to the movement of pins to ensure proper alignment of the image prior to the comparison being made.
