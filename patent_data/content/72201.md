# PARTICLE WASHING SYSTEM AND METHOD OF USE

## Abstract
A particle washing system and method of use is de scribed wherein in a preferred embodiment the fluid containing the desired particles is placed within an inner tube having near the bottom thereof an orifice with a diameter at least equal to that of the diameter of the particles, an air vent and, wherein the inner tube is positioned within an outer tube having a fluid with a density at least equal to that of the solution containing the particles to be separated within the inner tube but less than that of the particles. The application of centrifugal force to the particles directed toward the bottom of the outer tube causes the particles to move through orifice and through the outer so lution contained within the outer tube so that the particles are collected from the inner solution, washed by the outer solu tion, and subsequently sedimented at the bottom of the outer tube.
