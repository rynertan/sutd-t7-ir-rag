## Description
LIQUID DISPENSING APPARATUSThis invention relates to liquid dispensing apparatus and in particular to valves for controlling a flow of beverage. The invention finds particular application in dispensing carbonated beverages such as beer and lager.Previously known apparatus for dispensing liquids such as beverages incorporate valves having discrete components such as pistons and valve seats which, in use, are immersed in the liquid beverage and which may occlude dirt or other undersirable deposits. Such valves may only be cleared with difficulty, for example by dismantling the valve or by use of chemical cleansing reagents.According to the present invention a liquid dispensing apparatus is characterised in that collapsible tubing 8 is disposed in a duct 1 and a member 3 is arranged for sliding movement in a bore 10 communicating with said duct 1 and means arranged upon actuation to urge said member 3 into said duct 1 Preferably the said means comprises a camPreferably the apparatus is arranged so that said tubing may be completely collapsed thereby to prevent flow of the beverage. Spring means may be provided to urge the member out of the duct The member may, therefore, move to release the tubing when the cam does not urge the member into the ductThe member is preferably provided with a rounded portion which may compress the tube against a correspondingly rounded wall of the ductThe cam may be secured to a rotatably mounted structure and arranged to actuate the member when the structure is rotated.Apparatus in accordance with the present invention is particularly suited for dispensing highly pressurised beverages such as beer or lager. The apparatus may be adapted by altering the bore of the collapsible tubing to suit a particular pressure, for example high pressures may be dispensed through narrow tubing.When dispensing of highly pressurised beverages it is important that the drop in hydrodynamic pressure at the outlet is sufficient to prevent excessive effervescence.This may be achieved by incorporating an additional length of tubing within the apparatus, for example, a portion of the tubing may be coiled together.Preferably the collapsible tubing is supported externally along the entire length so as to minimise stress caused by the internal hydrodynamicpressure. Apparatus in accordance with this invention has many advantages The bore of the collapsible tubing is easy to clean and does not include any cavities which may occlude dirt such as are present in conventional apparatus.The present apparatus may be cleaned with a bottle brush or similar device The invention is now further described by means of an example with reference to Figures 1 to 5 of the accompanying drawings, of which Fig. 1 is a cross section of an arrangement in accordance with the invention Fig. 2 is a part cross section along the line A A of Fig0 1 Fig. 3 shows the arrangement of Figure 1 in another position Fig. 4 is a part cross section along the line B B of Figure 1 andFig. 5 is a cross section of a tap incorporating the valve shown in Figure 1.The same reference numerals have been used to indicate corresponding components in each of the Figures.Figures 1 to 4 show a beer dispensing valve comprising a collapsible plastics tube 8 disposed in a duct 1 in a block 2. A member 3 is disposed in a bore 10 in the block 2 and is arranged for sliding movement into and out of the duct 1 The member 3 is provided with a rounded end 4 which may cooperate with the generally cylindrical wall of the duct 1 to compress and close the tube 8 This is shown in Figures 1 and 2. The member 3 is urged against the tube 8 by a cam 6 which is secured to a rotatable structure 7. Rotation of the structure 7 may move the cam 6 out of contact with the member 3 thereby releasing the tube 8 as shown in Figures 3 and 4.A helical spring not shown may be provided in the cavity 9 to assist release of the tube.The cam 6 may in alternative embodiments of the invention be attached to a slideable or otherwise arranged structure rather than the rotatably mounted structure 7 disclosed above. It has been found that collapse of the tubing 8 into a generally semicircular configuration is advantageous in that the flow of liquid may be stopped more effectively than if the tube is collapsed into a generally flat configuration.Figure 5 shows a tap incorporating a valve as shown inFigure 1 and comprising a duct 11 in a block 12 with a member 13 disposed in a bore in the block communicating with the duct. The tap body 14 supports a rotatable member 15 part of which comprises the cam 16. Rotation of the member 15 therefore causes the valve to open or close as desired.Collapsible tubing 17 extends throughout the tap providing a hygenic and easily cleaned passageway for a beverage. The tubing 17 is sealed to the inlet of the tap by means of a collar 18 which serves to prevent liquid from entering between the tubing and the body 14 of the tap. An attachment 19, shown detatched from the tap, is used to secure the latter to a hose connected to a supply of beverage0A cylindrical chamber 20 is provided upstream of the valve0 The tubing 17 may be coiled into a helix in the chamber 20 to provide an elongated flow path within the tap. This may serve to reduce the hydrodynamic pressure at the valve and may thereby improve the dispensing of highly pressurised beverages. In the illustrated tap, the tube 17 is not coiled and a filling material 21 fills the chamber 20 to support the tubing 17. Tubing 17 of different bores may be used with taps incorporating valves in accordance with this invention, thereby facilitating optimum dispensing of beverages supplied at different pressures.
