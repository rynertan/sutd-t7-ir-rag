# Process for reducing phosphate ore.

## Abstract
A process for producing, for example, phosphorus pentoxide from phosphorus ore includes formulation of a feed with a phosphate ore, silica and solid carbonaceous material in amounts to produce a feed mixture having a CaO SiOâ‚‚ mole ratio of less than about 0.5. The feed mixture is formed into agglomerated feed particles and the particles are heated by exposure to radiation eminating from an oxidation zone to a temperature sufficient to reduce the phosphate by reaction with the solid carbonaceous material to form elemental phosphorus vapor without substantial melting of the agglomerated feed particles. Sufficient oxygen containing gas is provided to cause oxidation of the elemental phosphorus vapor within the oxidation zone to produce phosphorus pentoxide.
