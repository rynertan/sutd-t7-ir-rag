# Removal of surface oxide from solder.

## Abstract
A collar 11 is held in a solder bath at or adjacent the solder surface. An open top pot 14 moves up and down within the collar. The pot initially takes in solder from the bath, is moved up through the collar, and is sufficiently close sliding fit within the collar for the solder carried upward by the pot to shed its surface oxides as that surface clears the top edge of the collar. In alternative embodiments the pot and collar are each circular cylindrical and each rectangular in plan. In an embodiment the bottom edge of the collar is cut away and bevelled, and the pot descends to a bottom position in which it is still within the collar.

## Description
REMOVAL OF SURFACE OXIDE FROM SOLDERThe invention relates to methods and apparatus for removing oxides from a region of the surface of liquid solder held in a bath.It is well known that oxides form on the surface of liquid solder in a solder bath. These oxides are colloquially referred to as dross and various methods are used to remove thembefore soldering actually takes place. The most usual method is a scraping or wiping device pasing across the solder surface.This method, although effective, is wasteful in that a greater area of solder is cleared of oxide than is required, exposing fresh solder to the air and further oxidation.In accordance with the present invention, apparatus for remov ang oxides from a region of the surface of liquid solder, held in a bath, comprises a collar held at or adjacent the solder surface with its axis substantially vertical an open top pot whose walls fit closely within the walls of the collar means positioning the pot initially adjacent the bottom edge of, and coaxial with, the collar such that the pot takes in solder from the bath means to move the solder containing pot up to or beyond the top edge of the collar and back again into its initial position and with the fit between the moving pot and the collar being sufficiently close that the solder carried upward by the pot sheds its surface oxides as it clears the top edge of the collar.The movable pot need be only as large as is necessary to present an adequate surface area of solder to the workpiece being soldered. Thus the apparatus is considerably more efficient than the known scraping or wiping devices briefly outlined above.The pot and the collar may be circular, or may be rectangular. It has been found that the necessary close sliding fit between the pot walls and the collar can be larger with a rectangular configuration.The top and our bottom edges of the collar may be bevelled in a manner which aids the clearing of oxides from the edges of the pot and collar as the pot operates.The collar could be held rigidly relative to the solder bath, but preferably it is allowed to float up and down and or from side to side. With this feature the collar can then, to some degree, self centre about the moving pot.Preferably the collar is located relative to the bath by readily releasable clamps. The collar can then easily be removed for cleaning.Preferably also the necessary gap between the walls of the pot and the inside wall of the collar lies within the range 0.005 inches to 0.025 inches. It might advantageously lie between 0.010 inches and 0.020 inches since this has been found to give acceptable results. This gap 15 advantageously kept substantially constant lie. the walls of the pot and the collar are substan tially parallel with one another throughout the time the pot and collar overlap. There is then the minl mum tendency for any oxides to wedge in the gap as the pot ascends or descends. The accompanying drawings show, by way of example only, two apparatus each embodying the invention.They will now be described. In the drawings Figures la and 2a show a first apparats in side ele vation and in different stages of operation Figure lb shows the apparatus in plan Figure 2b shows part oF the apparatus in operation Figure 3a shows the main parts of the second appa ratus in side elevation and Figure 3b shows the apparatus of Figure 3a wex plodded1. Referring first to Figures 1 and Figures 2, a circular collar referenced 11 is held at one end of an elongate arm lla in a bath 12 of hot molten solder. The arm lia is fixed rigidly to the top edge of one side of the bath 12 and holds the collar 11 partly submerged in the solder surface 13. The bath 12 itself need not be described in detail. A small open topped solder containing pot 14 is circular cylindrical and Is sized to be a close sliding free moving fit in the collar 12. An arm 15 carries the pot 14 at one end, and its other end is fixed to the moving rod of a hydraulic or pneumatic doubleacting ram 16.As shown, when the ram 16 is in its initial retracted, position then the arm 15 positions the pot 14 with its top edge below the bottom edge of the collar 11 Figure la and with the pot and collar essentially coaxial, the common axis being substantially vertical.In use, oxides form on the surface 13 of the solder within the bath 12. These oxides are present on the solder surface within the collar 11. The pot 14 is initially held in the position illustrated inFigure la below the bottom edge of the collar 11.The ram 16 is then extended to move the pot, from that initial position, vertically up into the collar 11 as illustrated in Figure 2a. The pot carries enough solder with it to satisfy the soldering requirements of the workpiece 17 shown in Figures la and Za. Further upward movement of the pot 14, to a position illustrated in Figure 2b where the lifted solder surface clears the top edge of the collar 11, causes the surface oxides on the solder contained within the pot to roll1 as indicated by the curved arrows in Figure Zb. This is thought to be caused primarily be surface tension acting between the close sliding co operating pot and collar walls. If the gap wgw between the pot and the collar is too large, the effect is not properly produced. Conversely if the gap tBb Is too small then a smooth free moving action of the pot inside the collar cannot be obtained and again the required effect is not properly produced.The solder which is rolled off the top of the pot in this way returns automatically to the parent solder bath, carrying its surface oxides with it. The solder remaining within the pot presents an unoxldised surface to the workpiece 17. When the ram 16 is subsequently retracted to bring the pot 14 back to its Figure la position, the pot is again below the lower edge of the collar 11 allowing fresh solder to occupy the void created by its downward movement.The gap gw is essentially constant from the top edge to the bottom edge of the collar 11 throughout the time the collar and the pot 14 overlap. In other words, the collar and pot are coaxial and parallel. In Figures 3a and 3b the collar 11 and pot 14 are both rectangular rather than circular cylindrical, and the opposite bottom edges of the collar 11 are recessed as indicated at 18. They are also bevelled, as is the top edge of the collar, to enhance the cutting away of oxides from the sides of the pot 14 as the pot ascends and descends.In Figures 3a and 3b, the collar 11 is located in position in the parent bath 12 by arms 19, 21 which project rigidly from each opposite end of the collar 11 and enter L shaped clamps 22, 23 fixed releasably by screws 24 to the top edges of the bath sidewalls.As Figure 3b shows, the clamps 22, 23 locate the arms 19, 21 but allow them to float to a very limited extent up and down. This up and down gap between the arm ends and clamps may be no more than 0.010 inches and is preferably not less than 0.005 inches. The clamps 22, 23 are open sided and allow the collar 11 to move sideways. However, because the bottom edge of the collar 11 is recessed, the pot 14 does not come out of the bottom of the collar even when the pot reaches its lowest initial position. The pot can take in solder, in that position, provided its top edge moves below the top of the bevelled recess 18. The collar 11 thus self centres about the pot and it is not necessary to restrain its sideways or endways movement.As illustrated, the screws 24 are turned fully home and hold the clamps rigidly in their illustrated positions.The clamps are readily released by slackening the screws.
