## Description
Process for the Preparation of Antibiotics The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of P lactam containing antibiotics and to the antibiotics when produced by that process. The compounds of the formula I EMI1.1 in which the hydroxyethylmoietyhas the S configuration at C 8 have been alleged to have been produced by the processes of Danish Patent Application Nos. 4880 77 and 4974 76. The first of these preparations of racemic compounds involved a considerable number of synthetic steps many of which did not appear to offer acceptable yields. Clearly it would be desirable to find a synthesis requiring fewer steps. The second of the aforementioned alleged preparations involved enzymatic cleavage of acetyl groups from natural products. Again this process did not appear to offer acceptable yields nor did it appear to produce an acceptably pure product.Clearly it would be desirable to provide a process for the preparation of the compounds of the formula I that involved few synthetic steps and produced a pure product.Such a process has now been found. The present invention provides a process for the preparation of the compounds of the formula I as hereinbefore defined which process comprises the reaction of a cleavable ester of a compound of the formula II EMI2.1 tor thiolate of said ester, with a cleavable e ster of a compound of the formula III X CH2 CH2 NH2 III wherein X is a displaceable group, and thereafter cleaving the cleavable ester. Suitable cleavable esters for use in this process include those cleavable by chemical methods such as hydrogenolysis or hydrolysis, or by biological methods, i.e. in vivo hydrolysable esters. Particularly suitable are those cleavable by catalytic hydrogenation, for example the benzyl and substituted benzyl esters such as chlorobenzyl, methoxybenzyl and nitrobenzyl esters.A favoured cleavable ester for use in this invention is the p nitrobenzyl ester. Examples of in vivo hydrolysable esters include the acetoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl, a ethoxycarbonyloxymethyl and phthalidyl esters, of these the phthalidyl ester is preferred. Generally the amino group in the compound of the formula III is protected in conventional manner during the course of the reaction, suitably as a NH C02R moiety wherein R is a group such that C02R is an ester, for example C02R is a cleavable ester, wherein suitable cleavable esters are as described hereinabove. Suitably X is a chlorine, bromine or iodine atom or a CH3S020 or p CH3C6U4SO2O group. A particularly apt value for X in the compound of the formula III is the bromine atom. As previously indicated a particularly suitable cleavable ester for use in the compound of the formula III is the p nitrobenzyl ester. The reaction may be carried out on a thiolate salt of the ester of the compound of the formula II or more suitably the process may be carried out in the presence of an acid acceptor such as an alkali or alkaline earth metal carbonate or bicarbonate such as potassium carbonate. Suitably the reaction is carried out in polar organic solvents such as dimethylformamide.This step may also be carried out at a non extreme temperature for example 300C to 300C and it is a considerable advantage of this process that an ambient temperature may be employed. The desired product may be obtained by diluting the reaction mixture after completion with water and a water immiscible solvent and thereafter evaporating the dried organic layer. If desired purification may be effected chromatographically, for example on silica eluting with ethyl acetate optionally containing small amounts of ethanol. The cleavage of the ester groups by catalytic hydrogenation is generally carried out in a reaction medium maintained at approximate neutrality that is pH 6 8, more suitably 6.5 7.5 and preferably at pH 7 .This may be effected using a buffer such as a phosphate buffer in conjunction with a solvent system containing water and sufficient organic solvent to enable dissolution of the reactants, such as a mixture of water with dioxan optionally together with a lower alkanol such as ethanol.This step may also be carried out at a non extreme temperature as hereinbefore defined and it is once more a considerable advantage that an ambient temperature can be used. A low ambient or elevated pressure of hydrogen may be employed but it has proved convenient to use an atmospheric pressure of hydrogen.The catalyst used will generally be a transition metal catalyst of which palladium has proved suitable. A preferred catalyst is palladium on carbon. After completion of the reaction the desired product may be obtained by filtering off the solids, diluting with water, washing the aqueous solution with an immiscible solvent such as ether or ethyl acetate and then removing the water, for example by evaporation under low pressure or by freeze drying. If desired a purification step may be employed, for example by chromatography using a resin such as XAD 2, XAD 4 or Diaion HP20. A particular advantage of this process is that it yields a pure product that can be obtained in crystalline form. The esters of the compounds of the formula II may be prepared by the reaction of an ester of a compound of the formula V wherein the hydroxyethyl substituent has the S configuration at C 8 EMI5.1 with a source of hypohalous acid. Suitably the reaction is performed at a non extreme temperature such as 300C to 300C, preferably ambient. In general the solvent system used will be a homogeneous mixture of water and an inert organic solvent such as dioxan or acetone.Suitably the hypohalous acid is hypobromous acid or hypochlorous acid, of these hypobromous acid is preferred.Suitable sources of hypohalous acids include N bromoacetamide, N chloroacetamide and N bromopropionamide.
