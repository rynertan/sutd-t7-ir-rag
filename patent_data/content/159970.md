# Combination gun with repeater mechanism.

## Abstract
A gun with two barrels of different calibers wherein both barrels 25, 26 have a repeater mechanism, manual or auto matic, and wherein the weapon has a barrel selector mech anism 11, 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D, 11E which selectively, as desired, brings one barrel into an operative state while at the same time putting the other barrel in an inoperative state. The breech blocks 1, 2 for the respective barrels are joined together via a cam 1A on the breech block 1 , such that the two breech blocks together constitute a cam mechanism which permits movement of the other breech block 2 toward and away from the first breech block 1 transversely of the barrels, and that the two breech blocks, during repeater action of the weapon, move together and in parallel in the longitudinal direction of the barrels. The interconnected breech blocks 1, 2 thus together and synchronously lock the two breech blocks in their forward positions.
