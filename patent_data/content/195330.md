## Description
This invention relates to a flexible magnetic diskette for magnetically storing various information recorded and read by a magnetic head and engagable with and rotationally driven by a driving unit, said diskette comprising a plastic disk sheet having two sides which are uniformly coated with magnetic material and having a mount hole at a center thereof and including a periphery and holding means, mounted at the periphery of said mount hole, for securing said plastic disk sheet, said holding means comprising a holder body, made of plastic and held to said flexible disk sheet at the periphery of said mount hole a core member made of a magnetic metal and rigidly attached to said holder body and spaced from said plastic disk sheet, a center of the core member aligning with the center of said plastic disk sheet, wherein said holder body and said core member each have corresponding shaft insert holes passing therethrough, through which the center shaft is inserted, and the disk sheet is thus positioned relative to the magnetic head. Recently, a flexible magnetic diskette usually referred to as a floppy disk including a thin flexible disk sheet has become widely used because of its simple and low cost recording and regeneration capability. The flexible magnetic diskette conventionally includes a plastic disk sheet, uniformly coated on both sides with a magnetic material, and a holder for securing the periphery of a mount hole provided in the center of the disk sheet. Generally, such a flexible magnetic diskette is rotatable and is accomodated in a hard case or cartridge, usually referred to as a magnetic disk cartridge, which can be inserted into a disk drive unit for operating the function of recording or regeneration. A holder for securing the periphery of the mount hole of the flexible sheet is conventionally made of a pressed metal sheet or molded plastic material. However, the holders known in the prior art are not satisfactory for rigidly holding the magnetic sheet while maintaining the flexibility and desirable abrasion resistance thereof. GB A 2 102 188 teaches a flexible magnetic diskette having a holding means consisting of a hub 6 and an angular magnetic member 11, suitably mounted on its lower surface. However, this publication does not teach a flexible magnetic diskette having high abrasive resistance. EP A 0 133 541 discloses a diskette, wherein a recording medium is clamped between the angular ring and a flange of the hub body. A re enforcing metal plate is directly adhered to the opposite side of the magnetic diskette. This publication does not disclose an adhesive bonding between the flexible disk sheet and the holding means. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a flexible magnetic diskette provided with a holder for securing the periphery of the mount hole of the flexible sheet, which holder is satisfactory for rigidly holding the magnetic sheet while maintaining the flexibility and desirable abrasion resistance thereof. This object has been achieved by the features of claim 1. In the present invention, as the holding means comprises a plastic holder body and a metal core member, the flexible magnetic sheet can be retained in a stable condition and unfavorable deformation or undulation can be effectively prevented from occurring at the peripheral portions around the mount hole of the magnetic sheet. The stability against deformation is further increased because the temperature at which the material of the holder body 54 is deformed by an external force ist raised. In addition, the plastic holder body does not come into direct touch with the drive unit only the core member is in contact with the drive unit. Therefore, this diskette has good endurance properties for long term use. In the drawings, the same reference numerals and marks denote the same or corresponding parts of the embodiments of this invention. Referring now to the drawings, a first embodiment of a flexible magnetic diskette 50 according to the present invention comprises, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, a flexible magnetic sheet 51, a holder 52 including a double sided adhesive ring 53 and a plate body 54, and a flat core member 55 secured to the rotation driven side bottom face of the holder 52. The flexible magnetic sheet 51 is formed as a disk having a mount hole 51a at the center thereof. The adhesive ring 53 is made of a plastic film or sheet, and an adhesive material is coated on both sides thereof. The adhesive ring 53 is formed with an opening 53a having an inner diameter of substantially the same as the inner diameter of the mount hole 51a of the flexible magnetic sheet 51. The body 54 of the holder 52 is formed, by molding, as a disk plate of a plastic material having substantially the same or similar coefficient of thermal expansion as that of the flexible magnetic sheet 51. The body 54 is provided with a rectangular shaft insert hole 54a at the center thereof and a drive pin insert hole 54b in the vicinity of the hole 54a, and an upright cylindrical projection 54c having an outer periphery capable of fitting into the mount hole 51a of the flexible magnetic sheet 51. The body 54 is also provided with an outer flange 54f having a flat ring shaped supporting face 54e arranged at the outer periphery of the cylindrical projection 54c via a step. The supporting surface 54e is provided at the outer periphery thereof with an inclined face 54g see Fig. 1 . On the other hand, the body 54 is provided at its bottom with a cylindrical projection 54h see Fig. 1 connected to the flange 54f via a step. The body 54 of the holder 52 is advantageously made of a material, such as a polycarbonate including an additive of 5 to 35 weight , more preferably about 20 weight of carbon milled fibers. The core member 55 is a substantially flat disk made of a magnetic metal such as ferrite stainless steel, for example, SUS 430 ISO , having a coefficient of thermal expansion of 10.3 x 10 6 m C and having a good abrasion resistance. The core member 55 is provided with a shaft insert hole 55a at the center thereof, and in the vicinity thereof, with a drive pin insert hole 55b capable of aligning with the drive pin insert hole 54b of the holder body 54, a pair of diametrically opposed notches 55c at the outer periphery thereof for preventing free rotation thereof, and a neck portion 55d projected upward at the outer periphery thereof formed by, for example, burring. The flexible magnetic diskette 50 shown in Fig. 1 can be assembled as follows. First, the core member 55 is rigidly attached to the holder body 54. In this process, it is advantageous that the core member 55 be integrally molded with the holder body 54 when the latter is formed by molding. However, it is also advantageous that the holder body 54 having at its lower face a recess for accommodating the core member 55 be formed independently with respect to the latter, as seen in Fig. 2, and the core member 55 then rigidly fitted to that recess of the holder body 54. In this case, the neck portion 55d of the core member 55 should be a little smaller than the shaft insert hold 54a of the holder body 54, to facilitate the insertion of the core member 55, and should be positioned with respect to the holder body 54 by the outer periphery of the core member 55 and the insert recess of the holder body 54, so that the drive pin insert holes 54b and 55b are aligned with each other. Then, the double sided adhesive ring sheet 53 is fitted to the outer periphery of the cylindrical projection 54c and adhered to the supporting face 54e of the holder body 54. The magnetic sheet 51 is then inserted in the holder body 54 by fitting the mount hole 51a of the former to the outer periphery of the cylindrical projection 54c of the holder body 54. The magnetic sheet 51 is thus rigidly adhered by the inner edge of the mount hole 51a to the adhesive ring sheet 53. Thus, in the first embodiment as mentioned above, the holder 52 comprising the adhesive ring 53 and the holder body 54 serves to hold the magnetic sheet 51, and the core member 55 has the insert hole 55a in which the rotation drive shaft not shown in Figs. 1 and 2 is directly engaged. In Figs. 3 and 4, a magnetic disk cartridge 56 comprises a diskette 50, as mentioned above, and a hard case 26 for accommodating the diskette 50. The hard case 26 comprises upper and lower case halves 27 and 28 abutted together along the peripheral edges thereof. The upper case half 27 is provided on its inner wall with a center plate 27c and a cylindrical wall 27a therearound. The outer diameter of the cylindrical wall 27a is a little smaller than the inner diameter of the cylindrical projection 54c of the holder body 54, to allow the diskette 50 some freedom in the radial direction. The lower case half 28 is provided at its center with a circular opening 28a, which is a little larger than the outer diameter of the cylindrical projection 54h of the holder body 54, also to give the diskette 50 freedom in the radial direction. Therefore, the diskette 50 is rotatably accommodated in the case 26 with some freedom in the radial direction. The upper and lower case halves 27 and 28 have corresponding head insert holes 27b and 28b. A disk drive unit 30, generally shown by a dotted line, is provided with a cartridge insert slot 31, a chuck 32 at the inside of the cartridge insert slot 31, and a pair of upper and lower magnetic heads 33 and 34. The chuck 32 generally comprises a center shaft 32 1, a rotary table 32 2 rigidly mounted on the center shaft 32 1, a ring shaped magnet 32 3 mounted on the upper periphery of the rotary table 32 2, and a drive pin 32 4 mounted on the rotary table 32 2 so as to be capable of protruding upward therefrom. The cartridge 56 is inserted into the insert slot 31, as shown by an arrow B, and the case 26 is then placed in a predetermined position. Then, the rotary center shaft 32 1 and the drive pin 32 4 are automatically advanced to engage with the shaft insert hole 55a and the pin insert hole 55b of the core 55, respectively. On the other hand, the upper and lower magnetic heads 33 and 34 are given access to the magnetic sheet 51 to conduct a read or write record operation, as necessary. During these operations, the bottom of the core 55 is attracted to the support table 32 2 by means of the ring shaped magnet 32 3 and also urged radially outward, as shown by an arrow C in Fig. 4, by the drive pin 32 4, so that the adjacent two sides of the insert hole 55b engage with the rotary shaft 32 1 and, therefore, the flexible sheet 51 is located in its prescribed position. Thus, the magnetic diskette 50 can be rotated by the drive pin 32 4. To ensure a contact as perfect as possible between the flexible magnetic sheet 51 and the upper and lower magnetic heads 33 and 34, it is advantageous in practice that the lower magnetic head 34 be located slightly above the ideal contact surface of rotation by a small distance, for example, a few 100 x 10 ⁶m 100 microns , and on the other hand, the upper magnetic head 33 be urged downward with a small spring force, such as 20 g, for a 8,89 cm 3.5 inch diskette. Figures 5 and 6 show the outer appearance of the magnetic disc cartridge 56, in which a shutter 29 is made of thin plate material and formed in a U shaped cross section, and is provided with a pair of upper and lower windows 29a and 29b. The shutter 29 is slidingly mounted on the case 26, in the direction as shown by an arrow D, so that the head insert hole 27b 28b is closed by a spring means, not shown, when the cartridge 56 is not inserted and, on the other hand, automatically opened, as shown in Fig. 6, by the drive unit 30 Fig. 3 when the cartridge 56 is inserted. Figure 7 illustrates an exploded perspective view of the magnetic disc cartridge 56, in which reference numerals 57 and 58 denote upper and lower sheets made of a non fabric material. At least a part of each sheet is adhered to the upper or lower case half 27 or 28 and another part thereof is in contact with the front or back surface of the magnetic sheet 51, to remove any dust attached to the disk surfaces and to compensate for any possible nonuniformity of the rotation surfaces of the magnetic sheet 51 during rotation thereof. Reference numeral 59 denotes a leaf spring having one end mounted on the lower case half 28 and the other end in resilient contact with and exerting a slight force on the non fabric material sheet 58, to push it toward the magnetic sheet 51 60 denotes a protecting means for preventing unintentional recording and 61 denotes a spring means constantly urging the shutter 29 in a predetermined direction. Figures 8 and 9 illustrate a second embodiment of a flexible magnetic diskette according to the present invention. Only the constructions and operations thereof which are different from those of the first embodiment will be described. The diskette 50 includes a holding ring plate 63 in place of the double sided adhesive ring 53 Figs. 1 and 2 . The flexible magnetic sheet 51 is provided with a mount hole 51a, as well as several in this case, three notches 51b equidistantly set around the peripheral edge of the mount hole 51a for restricting the disc in the direction of rotation thereof. The holding ring plate 63 is made of a flat metal plate having a coefficient of thermal expansion substantially the same or similar to that of the flexible magnetic sheet 51 and formed with an opening 63a having an inner diameter substantially the same as the inner diameter of the mount hole 51a of the flexible magnetic sheet 51. The ring 63 is also provided with several notches 63b corresponding to the above mentioned notches 51b of the flexible magnetic sheet 51 and an inclined face 63c along the bottom outer peripheral edge thereof. The holding ring 63 also can be made of any suitable plastic material. The holder body 54 is provided, on the outer side wall of the cylindrical projection 54c, with several projections 54d capable of engaging with the notches 51b of the magnetic sheet 51. The flexible magnetic diskette 50 shown in Fig. 8 can be assembled as follows. First, the core member 55 is rigidly attached to the holder body 54, in the same manner as in the first embodiment described above. Then, the magnetic sheet 51 is inserted into the holder body 54 by fitting the mount hole 51a of the former to the outer periphery of the cylindrical projection 54c of the holder body 54 and also engaging the dent portions 51b with the projections 54d. The magnetic sheet 51 is supported by the inner edge of the mount hole 51a on the ring supporting surface 54e of the holder body 54 and restricted in the circumferential direction by the projections 54d. The ring plate 63 is then inserted into the body 54 through the magnetic sheet 51 by fitting the hole 63a of the ring plate 63 onto the cylindrical projected portion 54c of the holder body 54 and engaging the dent portions 63b with the projections 54d. Then, the upper end of the cylindrical projected portion 54c of the body 54 is pressed and heat deformed so as to rigidly secure the ring plate 63 to the body 54. Thus, in this second embodiment as mentioned above, the holder 52 comprising the pushing ring plate 63 and the holder body 54 serves to nippingly hold the magnetic sheet 51. In Fig. 10, the magnetic disk cartridge 56 is illustrated in an exploded perspective view, which is similar to Fig. 7, but showing the magnetic diskette 50 of the second embodiment including the non adhesive holding ring plate 63.
