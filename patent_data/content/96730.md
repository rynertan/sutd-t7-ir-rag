# Gas target method for the productions of iodine 123.

## Abstract
Charged particles 1 in the 45 15 MeV energy range incident upon isotopically enriched xenon 124 gas in a gas target assembly 5 cause nuclear reactions which yield radioactive xenon 123. The xenon 123, decaying either in the target assembly or in a decay vessel 9 removed from the target assembly, yields iodine 123 with very low levels of radioactive contaminants.
