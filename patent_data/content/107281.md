# A METHOD OF SHAPING POLYACRYLONITRILE FILM

## Abstract
A biaxially oriented acrylonitrile polymer film at least sub stantially free of moisture and or solvent is subjected to a tem perature sufficient to permit deformation thereof, whereafter the film is deformed into a predetermined shape and, while so deformed, is cooled to cause retention of said shape.
