# Demodulator for an asynchronous binary signal.

## Abstract
To decode a binary signal without regard to the speed at which it is read, each transition in the binary signal is detected, and the time lapse between successive transitions is detemined to thereby establish the length of a pulse in the binary signal. The length of one pulse is compared with that of the immediately preceding bit cell to determine whether their lengths are approximately the same or vary by a factor of approximately 2, and any change in the binary state of the signal is determined accordingly. A multiplexing technique is employed to simultaneously decode a number of signals in this manner.
