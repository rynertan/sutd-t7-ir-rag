# Suspender fastener.

## Abstract
A suspender fastener 20 comprises a first lever 22, a second lever 24 and a ratchet 26. The first and second levers are pivotally connected at the location of pivot retainers 60 in a manner such that a fulcrum is formed therebetween. A first pair of mutually proximate end portions of the levers are longitudinally spaced from the fulcrum, and form a pair of jaws 106, 108 for engaging a garment 27 therebetween. The ratchet 26 preferably includes a loop 78 for securing a suspender 25 thereto. The ratchet is variably engageable with the first 22 and second 24 levers in a manner such that co action between the ratchet and the levers causes the jaws to progressively tighten. In particular, the spacing between opposed sets of serrations 36, 56 decreases with increasing distance from the fulcrum.
