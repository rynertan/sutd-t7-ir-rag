# HIGH DENSITY V GROOVE MOS CONTROLLED THYRISTORS, INSULATED GATE TRANSISTORS, AND MOSFETS, AND METHODS FOR FABRICATION

## Abstract
Various vertical channel MOS gated power semicon ductor devices attain a high current capacity through min imization of various lateral distances within the devices and also attain essentially minimum cell size. Processes for fa bricating these devices employ a first mask to define both the location of a channel terminating upper electrode re gion and the location of a V groove, thereby avoiding any mask alignment at this point in the process. In one embodi ment, the first mask comprises silicon nitride, and is eventu ally removed. In another embodiment, the first mask com prises molybdenum silicide, and remains in the device structure to ultimately serve as the upper main electrode. Two different techniques are employed for opening contact windows through the polysilicon gate electrode material, and different structures result. In one of these, a plurality of short windows are provided generally at right angles to the V grooves.
