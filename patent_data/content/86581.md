# Gas analyzing apparatus and method.

## Abstract
A method and apparatus for fuel gas analysis using a rotary valve 6 for mixing air with fuel gas to be analyzed for calorific content. The speed of the rotary valve which deter mines the air fuel ratio is controlled by a controller 22 sensing combustion products resulting from a combustion in chamber 16 of the air fuel mixture. The control of the air fuel ratio is arranged to produce a substantially stoichiometric combustion at which condition the calorific content of the fuel gas is determined from the controller operation. The air supplied to the rotary valve is initially pumped through a dehumidifier 34 for removing water vapour to minimize the error in the measurement of the calorific content of the fuel gas produced by the entrained water vapour.
