# A unitary inflatable penile prosthesis.

## Abstract
A unitary, inflatable penile prosthesis system includes a prosthesis implantable within the corpus cavernosum of the penis in order to alleviate erectile impotency. A tubular enclosure 12 includes a distal pump 56 , a medial press urizable chamber 28 , and a proximal fluid reservoir 20 . A pump draws fluid from the reservoir through an external fluid passageway 42 into the pressurizable chamber. The pressurizable chamber is defined by an internal, tubular, substantially nondistensible portion 30 and a concentric tubular sleeve 32 . The nondistensible portion is crimped so that it may expand in diameter. Upon expansion, the prosthesis assumes a straight, erect state. The sleeve may elastically bias the nondistensible portion to its flaccid state. Fluid for filling the nondistensible portion may be stored in a rear fluid reservoir having a rigid internal stabilizer 22 .
