# 2 Omega alkylaminoalkyl and 2 omega dialkylaminoalkyl 3 4 X benzylidene phthalimidines.

## Abstract
The 2 ω alkylaminoalkyl and 2 ω dialkylaminoalkyl 3 4 X benzylidene phtalimidines are useful as local anesthetics. For the preparation, the adduct is formed between the suitable 3 4 X benzylidene phtalide and a substituted amino alkylamine, the adduct being then reacted with acetic anhy dride the X substituent at the position 4 of the benzylidene group then can be suitably converted according to the require ments.
