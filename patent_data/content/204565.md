# PROCESS FOR COATING THE INTERNAL SURFACE OF A METAL TUBE WITH A NEUTRON ABSORBER

## Abstract
A process for forming a boron containing coating on the internal surface of a zirconium or zirconium alloy hollow tube by heating the internal surface to a temperature of between 200 450 C and passing through the tube a mixture of a volatil ized boron compound in helium or argon, such that the boron compound decomposes to form an integral boron containing coating on the internal surface.
