# Improvements relating to seals.

## Abstract
A sealing assembly 20 for a ball valve comprises two non compressible and relatively movable members, for exam ple the ball 24 and seal housing 26 of a ball valve, having lo cated therebetween a sealing element 32 which is inflatable by the introduction of hydraulic fluid. The sealing element 32 is located in a recess in member 26 so that when the hydraulic pressure is released the ele ment 32 retracts into the recess to release the sealing en gagement and facilitate the relative movement of members 24, 26 . A resilient rubber ring 40 is provided to bias the seal housing 26 away from the position of sealing engagement to also facilitate movement of members 24, 26 . A second seal ing element 25 is also provided. Both elements are carried by the seal housing 26 which is in the form of an annular piston movable by the hydraulic fluid.
