# Process for producing array type ultrasonic probe.

## Abstract
Array type ultrasonic probes including those of the annular array type and the linear array type are produced with a high accuracy of arrangement of unit transducer elements by first providing an integral processed plate wherein unit back electrodes are almost configurated into their final shapes but connected with each other by connect ing portions so as to facilitate the handling thereof as an integral plate. The integral processed plate is bonded to a substrate and the connecting portions are removed to leave the back electrodes separately bonded to the substrate. On the back electrodes, a piezoelectric polymer film and a front electrode are applied to give an array tyoe ultrasonic probe adapted for medical diagnosis.
