# Multistage amplifier.

## Abstract
A multistage linear amplifier has a first stage amplifier 1 with a low noise figure and sufficient power gain to ensure that overall noise performance is satisfactory. An interstage am plifier or circuit 2 is protected from saturation by putting it between first 4 and second 5 variable attenuators, which are controlled by a level detector 6 . Level detector 6 detects signal level at an input of the in terstage amplifier 3 and feeds control signals to the variable attenuators in dependance upon the detected level. The first variable attenuator 4 functions as a level com pressor for input signals P‚ÇÅ thereto higher than preset level. The second variable attenuator 5 functions as a level ex pandor to restore the signal level compression of the first variable attenuator 4 . The multistage amplifier has a wide range of linear opera tion, with low noise characteristics, handling an input signal whose level varies over a wide range.
