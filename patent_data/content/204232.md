# Blow moldable polycarbonate resin compositions.

## Abstract
Articles of blow molded polycarbonate resins are de scribed, having improved flexural modulus. The method of improvement comprises the incorporation of mica particles or glass fiber into the blow moldable resin as a reinforcing filler. Advantageously the incorporation does not significant ly adversely affect the blow moldability of polycarbonate resins.
