# Measurement of sperm motolity.

## Abstract
A micro sample of semen is exposed to a beam of light from an inexpensive and small laser drive. Light scattered by the sample is detected by a photodetector. The photodetec tor signal is analysed in the frequency domain to provide a measure of the amplitude of the signal components having frequencies above about 100 Hz. This measure is representa tive of the numbers of motile sperm in the sample. A motile immotile percentage is obtained by dividing the motile measurement by a value representative of the amplitude of the full frequency photodetector signal. In a preferred embodiment frequency amplitude analysis is car ried out in the time domain using frequency splitting filters and integrating the filtered signals. The light receiving aperture for the photodetector is made annular or part annular in shape to overcome sample orientation or polarisa tion effects.
