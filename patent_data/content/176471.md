# PREFABRICATED COVERING AND BEARING PAVING TILE FOR SURFACES, SQUARES, STREETS, BUILDING OR OTHER

## Abstract
The paving tile consists of an outside covering layer 1 of stone material, and of a support layer 2 of cement material intimately joined together by a binder or adhesive 3 . Application of support layer 2 makes possible the reduction of covering 1 generally irregular or in a regular shape as a parellelepiped. The result is the formation of entirely regular paving tiles of constant thickness with ease in laying and in leveling of the surface to be covered. Further, the mechanical characteristics of strength and adherence are considerably increased because of the cement support, contributing to the solidity and life of the covering, while, on the other hand, a saving in material and labor is achieved. It has application in all uses for covering, buildings, streets, squares, surfaces, etc. and also as a bearing element.
