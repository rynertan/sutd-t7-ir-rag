## Description
MAGNETIC TAPE CARTRIDGE CARRIER BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the InventionThis invention relates to a carrier for containing a plurality of tape cartridges which may be placed in a storage rack, transportation cart or carry pack and secured by a support and locking apparatus. Description of Prior ArtSince the introduction of tapes and the like, which are disposed within cartridges, cassettes or similar containers, a number of carry cases and holders have been available in the art for receiving, supporting and storing such cassettes, cartridges or the like. Usually, such holders are for a specific purpose, for example, use as a carrying case or for storage in a stationary location such as on a shelf.U.S. Patent 4,293,075 issued Oct. 6, 1981 to Veralrud and entitledCABINET FOR HOLDING MAGNETIC TAPE CARTRIDGES AND CASSETTES describes a multi shelf cabinet for storing several different types of tape units having different dimensions. The shelves are sloped from front to back and include molded sidewall steps such that endless tape cartridges, reel to reel cassettes and cassettes in boxes of different sizes may be retained in the cabinet by the appropriate dimensional sidewall steps.U.S. Patent 3,907,116 issued Sept. 23, 1975 to Wolf et al entitledCASSETTE RACK describes a holder for both boxed and unboxed magnetic reel to reel cassettes which also includes rearward sloping support shelves in the form of stepped sidewalls of different dimensions to retain the boxed cassettes and the smaller dimensioned unboxed cassettes. In the prior art, the storage units are for a single purpose, i.e., stationary storage on a shelf or in a console, or as a portable carry case. The cassettes, cartridges or the like are disposed on endwall rails or flanges and are retained in place by gravity due to rearward slope or the like. There is no positive locking feature for maintaining the cartridges or cassettes securely in the holders.The present invention differs from the prior art as will be seen from the following description. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONAn object of the present invention is to provide a carrier for tape cartridges that may be inserted and stored in separate ones of a plurality of different storage units.Another object of the present invention is to provide a carrier for tape cartridges that includes a locking apparatus for maintaining the carrier securely in a storage unit.A further object of the present invention is to provide a carrier for tape cartridges that may be positively mounted and stored in a mass storage rack, a transportation cart or an individual carry pack.

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTIONMagnetic tapes of the type which are contained in cartridges are used in a number of industries, one in particular being associated with electronic typewriters wherein text material is stored on the tapes. In such instance the magnetic tapes are subject to being retained in storage, retrieved from storage, and periodically moved from location to location. It is desirable that a single container for such cartridges be provided which may be easily placed in and removed from bulk storage, and, which may also be used to retain the cartridges when such cartridges are moved from place to place.FIG. 1 illustrates a carrier for magnetic tape cartridges according to the present invention. The carrier includes top, bottom, left side and right side members which form a rectangular frame 10. A centre member 12 intermediate to and parallel to the top and bottom members divides frame 10 into upper and lower compartments. A plurality of vertical members 14 1, 14 2, 14 3 ... 14 M are spaced inside frame 10 parallel to the left and right side members. Vertical members 14 1 through 14 M extend the depth of frame 10, thereby dividing the upper and lower compartments thereof into a plurality of separate recesses, the dimensions of which are predetermined to be slightly greater than the dimensions of the magnetic tape cartridges to be stored. In each recess, at the bottom thereof, a slidable member 16 1, 16 2, 16 3 ... 16 M is disposed. Each of the members 16 1 through 16 M terminates in a right angle bend and also extends past the edge of bottom member and centre member 12. Thus, when a magnetic tape cartridge is placed in any of the recesses, the end of appropriate slidable members 16 1 ... 16 M at the bottom of the recess is grasped and pulled in order to easily remove the desired tape cartridge from the recess. When the tape cartridge is manually replaced in the recess, it will cause the slidable member to return to the position shown in FIG.1.Referring to FIG. 2, a side elevation view is shown illustrating how the right angle portion of the slidable elements 16 1 through 16 M may be fitted into corresponding recesses in a back member 18 of the element 10. An alternative to slidable members 16 1 through 16 M having a right angle termination would be to have slidable members 16 1 through 16 M flat, but have a high friction upper surface, such as having a rubberized coating on which the magnetic cartridge would be retained during input and output movements.A high friction strip, such as a rubber strip can be mounted along the length of the front of shelf 12 and the front of the bottom member. The rubber strip is dimensioned to be slightly higher than the front of shelf 12 and the front of the bottom member.The carrier shown in FIG. 1 further includes apertures 20, 22, 24 and 26 located on the front corners of the top and bottom elements of frame 10 as shown These apertures serve to provide a simple and rapid locking and retaining scheme whereby the carrier may be placed, along with other carriers, on a mass storage rack.Referring to FIG. 3, a portion of the mass storage rack is shown including vertical support members 30 and 32 Flanges 34, 36, 38 and 40 are fastened onto vertical support members 30 and 32. Flanges 34, 36, 38 and 40, which are T shaped in cross section are spaced an appropriate distance such that the carrier may be fitted between the flanges. The lower surface of the flanges contain leaf springs 42 while the upper surfaces, on each side of the vertical portion of the flange, contain bosses 44.Thus, when the carrier is moved forward in FIG. 3 it will rest on the upper surface of the flanges 38 and 40 and the bosses on the upper surfaces of flanges 38 and 40 will insert through the lower apertures 24 and 26. The springs on the bottom surfaces of flanges 34 and 36 will snap into corresponding upper apertures 20 and 22 and the carrier will be locked into the flanges 34, 36, 38 and 40 by means of the top and bottom apertures 20, 22, 24 and 26.FIGS. 4, 5 and 6 illustrate in sequence the manner in which the carrier is moved forward, inserted and locked into the flanges 30, 32, 34 and 36.It should be noted that in FIG. 3 the flanges 34, 36, 38 and 40 include a spring and boss on the other side of the vertical portion of the T in order to accommodate another carrier. In this manner, a large number of carriers may be locked into the vertical support members to provide a mass storage array, for example, covering an entire wall or disposed in aisles. An advantage of the carrier shown in FIG. 1 is that it may be inserted in apparatus other than the mass storage rack shown in FIG. 3.Referring to FIG. 7, a movable cart is shown including a vertical support member 46 on which are mounted a plurality of flanges 48 similar to flanges 34, 36, 38 and 40 of FIG. 3. The carriers are placed in the flanges in the same fashion as described relative to FIG. 3 and are retained by springs and bosses within the apertures 20, 22, 24 and 26 of the carrier. The cart of FIG. 7 further includes wheels and handles so it may be readily moved about. Thus, a user could enter the mass storage area, remove selected carriers from the mass storage racks and place them securely in the cart for transportation to another location. Finally, if only one carrier at a time is required, a hand held transport into which the carrier is fitted may be provided as shown inFIG. 8.It is seen, therefore, that a total system has been described wherein a unique magnetic tape cartridge carrier as shown in FIG. 1, which contains a plurality of slidably accessible tape cartridges, may be used and stored in a number of different environments including a mass storage rack having a locking scheme which cooperates with the carrier structure, a movable cart having a similar locking scheme, and a hand held transport. While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing and other changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, instead of a single centre shelf member 12 providing upper and lower rows of enclosures, as shown in FIG.1, a plurality of such shelves may be provided for dividing the carrier into three or more rows of enclosures.
