# Arrangement for producing an electrical signal proportional to forced vital lung capacity as measured by a spirometer.

## Abstract
In a spirometer including an expansible chamber 22 of the piston type there is provided an arrangement for producing an electrical signal which is related to the volume of the chamber 22 , said arrangement comprising an indicia strip 82 associated with the piston 14 of the chamber 22 and including two columns 76, 78 of alternating light and dark bars, the columns 76, 78 being offset from one another by one half the thickness of a bar and two photodetectors 72, 74 associated with a fixed member 70 of the spirometer and arranged to respectively observe the columns 76, 78 , the photodetectors 72, 74 generating signals which are shifted 90 DEG from one another as the columns 76, 78 pass through their respective field of view and which are continuously sampled as digital words, the consecutive words being compared and the comparison result processed to produce said electrical signal.
