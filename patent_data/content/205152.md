# EXTRACTION MECHANISM FOR INJECTION MOULDING MACHINE AND METHOD OF REMOVING MOULDED ARTICLES FROM AN INJECTION MOULDING MACHINE

## Abstract
A programmable mechanism for extracting a moulded article from an injection moulding machine comprises a sup port member 14 movable in a direction perpendicular to the plane of separation of two mould members 6, 8 , and a support arm 30, 130 on the support member 14 capable of arcuate movement about the support member 14 . The arm 30, 130 carries an extraction device 32 for engaging a moulded article, which is interchangable with other extraction devices for engaging other moulded articles. The support member and arm undergo generally simultaneous smooth movements, and move towards a position for extracting an article while the mould members 6, 8 are separating. There may be a controlled pivoted joint J in the arm 130 , to give further control over the extracted position of an article and the extraction path. Use of the mechanism facilitates changing from moulding of one article to moulding of a different article, and results in a faster extraction operation.
