## Description
ARTIFICIAL PULP PARTICLES AND PROCESSFOR PRODUCING THE SAME FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to artificial pulp particles and a process for producing the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to artificial pulp particles useful for producing electric insulating paper like sheet materials having excellent heat resistance and mechanical strength, and a desirable poor moisture absorbing property, by a conventional paper making process, and a process for producing the artificial pulp particles. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is well known that wood pulp particles are used for producing electric insulating paper which is used in a wide variety of electric devices, apparatuses and machines.However, the conventional electric insulating paper is unsatisfactory due its high moisture absorbing property, poor heat resistance and poor dielectric property.Especially, in various miniaturized and weight reduced electric devices and machines, for example, electric motors, generators and transformer, heat resistant, very thin and light electric insulating sheets are needed.However, when the conventional insulating paper is made very thin, the resultant thin paper is unsatisfactory in its heat resistance, insulating property and resistance to moisture. Accordingly, various approaches have been taken to provide new types of insulating sheets having an excellent insulating property, heat resistance and mechanical strength and a poor moisture absorbing property. For example,Japanese Patent Application Publication kokoku No. 43 20421 1968 discloses an electric insulating paper like sheet in which a number of mica particles are mixed and entangled with a number of substantially non melted aromatic polyamide fibrids. This paper like sheet exhibits an excellent heat resistance. However, the mechanical strength and moisture absorbing property of the paper like sheet is variable depending upon the content of the mica particles in the paper like sheet. That is, a large content of the mica particles results in a poor mechanical strength of the paper like sheet.Also, a small content of the mica particles causes the resultant paper like sheet to exhibit an undesirably enhanced moisture absorbing property. Japanese Patent Application Publication kokoku No. 38 8421 1963 discloses a modified paper which has been produced from a mixture of kraft pulp and polypropylene fibers by the paper making process. However, this modified paper is unsatisfactory due to it poor heat resistance.Also, the mechanical strength and moisture absorbing property of the modified paper is variable depending on the content of the polypropylene fibers in the modified paper. That is, a large content of the polypropylene fiber causes the resultant modified paper to exhibit a poor mechanical strength and a small content of the polypropylene fibers results in an undesirably high moisture absorbing property of the modified paper. Also, it is known that polyesters, for example, polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene naphthalates, exhibit an excellent heat resistance substantially no moisture absorbing property and a desirable electric insulating property, and therefore, are useful as an electric insulating material. The polyester insulating material is usually used in the form of film, woven fabric or non woven fabric. However, the polyester insulating material has not yet supplied in the form of paper like sheet, which is strongly desired on the commercial market. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide artificial pulp particles useful for producing a paper like sheet having an excellent electric insulating property, heat resistance and mechanical strength and substantially no moisture absorbing property, and a process for producing the same.

The amount of the heat resistant aromatic polymer material to be contained in the solution is variable depending on the amount of the polyester material to be contained in the dispersion. However, usually, it is. preferable that the heat resistant aromatic polymer material be contained in an amount of from 2 to 15 by weight in the solution. The dispersion may be prepared by uniformly dispersing the polyester material in the solvent and, then, dissolving the heat resistant aromatic polymer material in the solvent, or by dissolving the heat resistant aromatic polymer material in the solvent and, then, dispersing the polyester material in the solution. In the case where the aromatic polymer material is produced in a solvent by a solution polymerization method, and the resultant polymer material is in the state of a solution, the polyester material may be added to the solution copolymerization mixture either before the start of the polymerization procedure or after the completion of the polymerization procedure.

In the contacting procedure of the dispersion with the coagulating liquid, the mixture is vigorously stirred so that a strong shearing and or beating action is applied to the resultant coagulated aromatic polymer material matrix component. This application of the shearing and or beating action is very important to provide the amorphous artificial pulp particles having a appropriate size and shape, and being capable of entangling with each other so as to form a paper like sheet by way of a conventional paper making method. The shearing or beating action may be created by using any type of stirring device as long as the action can be properly appli ed to the coagulated aromatic polymer material. Usually, it is preferable that the stirring procedure be carried out by using stirring wings capable of rotating at a very high speed.The stirring procedure may be applied to the mixture of the dispersion and the coagulating liquid contained in a tank shaped vessel or tube haped conduit. The resultant. artificial pulp particles preferably have a size of 10 mesh or smaller. The artificial pulp particles of the present invention are useful for producing a paper like sheet by using a conventional wet type paper making apparatus, for example, a long net type or circular net type paper making machine.The paper like sheet can be produced from either the artificial pulp particles of the present invention alone, or a mixture of the artificial pulp particles and short fibers.

The hot rolled sheet was dried at a temperature of l700C for two hours and, then, heat treated at a temperature of 2550C for two days, and thereafter, at a temperature of 2650C for two days. The heat treated polyethylene terephthalate sheet was preliminarily crushed by using a hammer mill and, then, pulverized by using a jet stream pulverizing machine.The particles of the pulverized polyethylene terephthalate had an average size of 3 microns. B. Preparation of a heat resistant aromatic polymer material solution 90 parts by weight of a powdered poly m phenylene isophthalamide having an inherent viscosity inh of 1.9, which had been determed in a concentration of 0.5 g 100 ml in a 95 sulfuric acid at a tmeperature of 30 C, were dissolved in a mixture solvent consisting of 910 parts by weight of N methyl 2 pyrrolidone and 40 parts by weight of water. C. Preparation of a dispersion 360 parts by weight of the finely pulverized polyethylene terephthalate were uniformly dispersed in the above mentioned prepared poly m phenylene isophthalamide solution by using a kneader. D. Preparation of a coagulating liquid A coagulating liquid was prepared by mixing 30 parts by weight of N methyl 2 pyrrolidone with 70 parts by weight of water. E. Production of artificial pulp particles A tube stirrer type continuous pulp forming apparatus having a stirring device composed of a combination of a stator having a baffle and a turbine wing type rotor, and a supply inlet for the dispersion, another supply inlet for the coagulating liquid and a discharge outlet for the resultant artificial pulp particle slurry, was used. The dispersion and the coagulating liquid were simultaneously fed at feeding rates of 0.4 kg min. and 15 kg min. respectively, to the pulp forming apparatus, while the resultant slurry was discharged from the apparatus.The temperatures of the dispersion and the coagulating liquid were adjusted to 500C and 350C, respectively. The rotation number of the rotor was 9600 r.p.m. The discharged slurry containing the resultant artificial pulp particles were allowed to stand at a temperature of 350C for about 30 minutes. Thereafter, the slurry was placed in a Nutsche vacuum filtering device to separate the artificial pulp particles from the slurry.The filtering device was provided with a filter consisting of a 150 mesh stainless steel net. The resultant filtrate was clear and contained substantially no polyethylene terephthalate particles. That is all the polyethylene terephthalate particles were embedded within the matrix consisting of the poly m phenylene isophthalamide. The artificial pulp particles were completely washed with ion exchanged water by using the Nutsche vacuum filtering device. F.
