# A PROCESS AND RELATIVE WEIGHING INSTRUMENT IN WHICH AT LEAST ONE STRAIN GAGE IS USED

## Abstract
This invention provides that a weight as sensed by one or more strain gages applied to an elastic element 10 subjected to the action of said weight is made independent of some parameters, such as hysteresis and permanent deformation or creep , by subjecting said element to at least one magnetic pulse. Therefore, the relative weighing instrument also comprises a coil 11 located adjacent the elastic element 10 , said coil 11 supplying at least once during the weighing cycle a current pulse generating a change of magnetic field in said element.
