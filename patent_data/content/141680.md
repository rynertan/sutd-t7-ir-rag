# PLASTICS LINED PIPES

## Abstract
The present invention relates to internally lined metal pipes, and specifically to such pipes which include means for sealing the liner of two pipes when the pipes are joined together end to end. To this end an outer main pipe 5, 17, 22, 27 is provided with a plastics liner sleeve 7, 28 insertable in the pipe 5, 17, 22, 27 and having a projecting end portion 8 forming a sealing band. An annular flange ring 9, 20, 26 is placed at or adjacent the end 8 and has an inner diameter less than the outer diameter of end 8. A spigot 13, 23, 29 is provided on the flange ring to form a companion sealing band so that one sealing band encircles the other with a sealing ring 14 located between the sealing bands and a gasket seal locatable between abutting flange rings 9, 20, 26 of end to end pipes.
