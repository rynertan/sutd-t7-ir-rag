# Novel microorganisms of the genus Eschericia, hybrid DNA for use in their production and the use of the microorganisms in the preparation of glutathione.

## Abstract
Glutathione may be prepared in large amount by culturing a microorganism of the genus Escherichia, which acts upon an enzyme system comprising γ glutamyl L cysteine synthetase and glutathione synthetase and which is capable of reducing inhibition of γ glutamyl L synthetase by glutathione, and is derived from a parent strain which is capable of acting upon the said enzyme system and which is capable of reducing inhibition of γ glutamyl L cysteine synthetase by glutathione, the said microorganism having chromosome DNA of a foreign strain of the genus of Escherichia comprising the genetic information for γ glutamyl L cysteine synthetase integrated into the said pa rent strain, the said foreign strain acting upon an enzyme system of γ glutamyl L cysteine synthetase and glutathione synthetase and being capable of reducing inhibition of γ glutamyl L cysteine synthetase by glutathione. The mic roorganism may also be cultured to accumulate an enzyme system comprising γ glutanyl L cysteine synthetase and glutathione synthetase followed by reaction of L glutamic acid, L cysteine and glycine in the presence of said enzyme system to accumulate glutathione. The microorganisms for use in the process of the invention and hybrid DNA comprising a plasmid carrying the genetic information for γ glutamyl L cysteine synthetase are novel and processes for preparing them are described.
