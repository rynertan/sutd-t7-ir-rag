# Method of determining the signatures of arrays of marine seismic sources, and of accumulating data for use in such methods.

## Abstract
In order to determine the signature of an array of n seismic sources 21 to 27, for instance marine seismic sources in the form of air guns, the array is actuated and the emitted pressure wave is measured at n independent points whose positions will respect to the array are known by hydrophones 31 to 37. The measurements are processed to produce n equivalent signatures of the n sources taking into account the interactions therebetween. The signature of the array is then determined merely by superposing the n equivalent signatures.
