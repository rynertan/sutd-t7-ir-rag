# Tobacco trimmer device.

## Abstract
A tobacco stream is formed on the underside of a vacuum belt conveyor and is transported past a tobacco trimming device 18 to be converted into a rod like filler which is draped onto cigarette paper and severed to yield discrete cigarettes which are united with filter plugs. Trim ming device 18 consists of overlapping disc knives 19 and 20 . Overlapping of discs knives 19 and 20 eliminates the need for brushes to remove excess tobacco.
