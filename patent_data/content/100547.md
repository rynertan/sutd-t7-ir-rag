# Exhaust emission control device for diesel engine.

## Abstract
An exhaust emission control device for Diesel engines comprising a trap 14 disposed in an exhaust pipe 12 connected to an exhaust manifold and a trap heating burner 16 disposed outside the exhaust pipe 12 , whereby a combustion gas from the burner 16 is led to the outer peripheral portion of the trap 14 to heat the same. According to the exhaust emission control device for Diesel engines of the present invention, the stable oxidation of particulates collected on the trap 14 in the exhaust pipe is achieved independently of the flow rate of the exhaust gas, the exhaust pressure and the amount of Oâ‚‚ in the exhaust gas.
