# A modular element plant for degrading organic wastes by means of earth worms.

## Abstract
A plant consisting of modular elements for swallowing organic wastes by degrading them by means of earth worms, comprising a tank 2 for organic wastes, arranged outside the plant assembly, a slopped main screw feeder 3 for lifting the materials onto working stations and discharging them onto horizontal screw feeders 4 arranged at any working station, said horizontal feeders conveying said materials to horizontal conveyors 6 , which discharge them into modular containers 1 arranged on the working stations, from which, at the end of the transformation, the material is discharged through hop pers 9 onto conveyers 10 arranged at the plant base and conveyed to storage containers.
