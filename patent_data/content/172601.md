# Control system for a motor vehicle propulsion unit.

## Abstract
A system for controlling a propulsion unit is provided with a vehicle speed sensor for sensing vehicle speed and for producing a signal when the vehicle speed exceeds a predetermined value, a neutral range sensor of the transmis sion, a drive range sensor, and an accelerator pedal release sensor. The system has further an actuator for fuel cutting off. When the vehicle coasts at a higher vehicle speed than the predetermined value with the transmission in the drive range and the accelerator pedal released, the fuel is cut off. When the neutral range is selected with the fuel cut off, the clutch is disengaged after a delay.
