# Ultrasonic Doppler flowmeter.

## Abstract
An ultrasonic Doppler flowmeter is disclosed in which a received signal processing part 20 includes a reference signal generator 210,212 for generating a reference signal corresponding to the magnitude of a received signal, and a comparator 214 for comparing the received signal with the reference signal. The reference signal varies in accordance with the magnitude of the received signal, and further may possess a hysteresis width corresponding to the output of the comparator. Therefore, a noise signal is effectively removed from the received signal at the comparator, and only a Doppler shift frequency is detected.
