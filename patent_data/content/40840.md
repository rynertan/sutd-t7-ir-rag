# Apparatus for filling viscous substances into hard gelatin capsules.

## Abstract
An apparatus for filling viscous substances into hard gelatin capsules, while heating and stirring the viscous substances to be filled in. The apparatus is entirely sim plified in construction, reliable in operation and inex pensive. It comprises a hopper I for storing the viscous substances at a predetermined temperature and under agitation, a pumping mechanism II which communicates with the bottom portion of said hopper I and is equipped with filling nozzle means 9 capable of weighing and discharging the viscous substance in predetermined amounts at a predetermined cycle, a capsule body load ing board III , a reciprocating feed mechanism IV for reciprocating the capsule body loading board III bet ween a preliminary operating station and a filling station and an intermittent rotary mechanism V for the capsule body loading board III to sequentially align the capsule body accommodating holes 22 of said board III with said filling nozzle means 9 .
