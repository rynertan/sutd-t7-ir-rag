## Description
Pharmaceutical composition and a method for enhancing the absorption of a pharmaceutically active compound This invention relates to a novel pharmaceutical composition and to a method enhancing the absorption of a pharmaceutically active compound. More particularly, it relates to a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a pharmaceutically active compound having an absolute bioavailability of not more than 20 and diltiazem or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof. It is known that diltiazem chemical name d 3 acetoxy cis 2,3 dihydro 5 2 dimethylamino ethyl 2 p methOxyphenyl l,5 benzothiazepin 4 5H one or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof is useful as a calcium antagonistic coronary vasodilator, but the effect of this compound on the absorption of a co administered drug has not been known. Pharmaceutically active compounds or drugs may be administered by various routes including oral, rectal, sublingual buccal , intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and topical routes. Among these routes, oral route is generally most convenient. However, oral administration of a drug to patients sometimes gives rise to a great deal of inter individual difference in the blood concentration of the drug because of variation in absorbability of the drug between each patients, while such blood concentration of the drug may also be affected by a. number of other factors such as, for example, solubility thereof in gastro intestinal fluids, stability against chemical or enzymatic decomposition, permeability through gastro intestinal mucosa or metabolic decomposition in liver.Moreover, bioavailability of a drug is an important factor to elicit the pharmacological effect thereof in living bodies. However, when a drug which shows poor bioavailability is administered orally, it is generally difficult to achieve an adequate blood concentration of the drug. As a matter of course, the blood concentration of such drug may be increased to some extent by increasing the dose thereof, but in this case the drug may cause undesirable side effects. As a result of various investigations, we have now found that diltiazem or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof is quite useful to improve or enhance the bioavailability of a pharmaceutically active compound having poor oral bioavailability. Namely, when a pharmaceutically active compound or drug has poor bioavailability i.e., an absolute bioavailability of not more than 20 , the absorption of said pharmaceutically active compound can be remarkably enhanced by administering it enterally together with diltiazem or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof.For example, when 40 mg of propranolol hydrochloride absolute bioavailability about 4 are administered orally to beagle dogs together with 30 mg of diltiazem hydrochloride, said propranolol shows the plasma concentration of about 100 ng ml, whereas said drug when used alone shows the plasma concentration of only about 25 ng ml. An object of the present invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition suitable for use by enteral administration e.g., oral or rectal administration and also suitable for enhancing absorption of a pharmaceutically active compound having an absolute bioavailability of not more than 20 .Another object of the invention is to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutical active compound having an absolute bioavailability of not more than 20 and diltiazem or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof. A further object of the invention is to provide a method for enhancing absorption of a pharmaceutically active compound by administering it enterally together with diltiazem or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof.These and other objects of the present invention will be apparent to persons skilled in the art from the following description. In this specification and claims, the terms absolute bioavailability is defined as a value which is calculated by the following formula AUC p.o. X Dose i.v. X 100 AUC i.v. Dose p.o.wherein AUC p.o. 1 and AUC i.v. stand for the areas under the blood concentration time curves which are estimated by oral and intravenous administration of a drug. The smaller the above mentioned value, the less the amount of a drug which reaches the systemic circulation. Therefore, the term absolute bioavailability always shows the degree of completeness of absorption of a pharmaceutically active compound in systemic circulation. The absorption enhancing effect of diltiazem is observed in any pharmaceutically active compound having an absolute bioavailability of not more than 20 . Thus, a wide variety of pharmaceutically active compounds having such absolute bioavailablity can be used for the purpose of the present invention irrespectively of the pharmacological or therapeutic effects thereof, insofar as they do not contraindicate with diltiazem Examples of such pharmaceutically active compound include i adrenergic P blocking agents such as propranolol chemical name l isopropylamino 3 l naphthyloxy 2 propanol or alprenolol chemical name l 2 allylphenoxy 3 isopropyl amino 2 propanol ii catecholamines acting on sympathetic nervous system such as dopamine, N L alanyldopamine chemical name N L alanyl 3, 4 dihydroxyphenethylamine,, N L isoleucyldopamine chemical name N L isoleucyl 3,4 dihydroxyphenethylamine , N N acetylalanyl 3, 4 diethoxycarboxyphenethylamine, N N acetylmethionyl 3, 4 diethoxycarboxyphenethylamine or iso proterenol iii benzodiazepine derivatives acting on central nervous system such as diazepam chemical name 7 chloro 1,3 dihydro 1 methyl 5 phenyl 2H 1, 4 benzodiazepin 2 one or flurazepam chemical name 7 chloro 1 2 dimethylamino ethyl 5 o fluorophenyl l,3 dihydro 2H l,4 benzodiazepin 2 oneD iv vasodilators such as isosorbide dinitrate, nitroglycerin or amyl nitrite v cardiotonics or antidiabetic agents such as benzylalcohol derivatives of the formula EMI5.1 wherein R1 is hydrogen or alkyl of one to 4 carbon atoms, R is hydrogen or alkyl of one to 4 carbon atoms and n is an integer of one to 3 vi bronchodilators such as tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives of the formula EMI5.2 wherein each of RÚ, Rê and R is hydrogen or alkyl of one to 4 carbon atoms vii hemostatics such as carbazochrome sulfonic acid chemical name l methyl 5 semicarbazono 6 oxo 2, 3, 5,6 tetrahydroindole 2 sulfonic acid or adrenochrome monoaminoguanizine viii antispasmodics such as timepidium halide chemical name 1, 1 dime thyl 5 methoxy 3 dithien 2 yl methylene piperidinium halide and ix antitussives such as tipepidine chemical name 3 di 2 thienylmethylene 1 methylpiperidine . The above mentioned drugs may be used either in free form or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Depending on the physico chemical characteristics of the drug, said pharmaceutically acceptable salt may further be either inorganic acid addition sal ts such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide or sulfate organic acid addition salts such as citrate, acetate, oxalate, hibenzate i.e., 2 4 hydroxybenzoyl benzoate or methanesulfonate alkali metal salts such as sodium salt or potassium salt alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium salt or magnesium salt amine salts and the like. Among the above mentioned drugs, especially suitable for use in the present invention are propranolol, alprenolol, dopamine, N N acetylalanyl 3, 4 diethoxycarboxyphenethylamine, N N acetylmethionyl 3, 4 diethoxycarboxyphenethylamine, diazepam, isosorbide dinitrate, 01 3, 4 dimethoxyphenethyl aminomethyl 4 hydroxybenzylalcohol, O 3,4 dimethoxyphenethyl aminomethyl 3 hydroxybenzylalcohol, g o methyl 3, 4,5 trimethOxyphenethylamino methyl 2 hydroxybenzylalcohol, trimetoquinol chemical name 1 3,4, 5 trimethoxybenzyl 6, 7 dihydroxy 1, 2,3, 4 tetrahydroisoquinoline , l 3,4,5 trimethoxy benzyl 5, 7 dihydroxy l, 2,3, 4 tetrahydroisoquinoline, l methyl5 semicarbazono 6 oxo 2,3,5,6 tetrahydroindole 2 sulfonic acid, timepidium halide, tipepidine and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. On the other hand, diltiazem to be used together with the pharmaceutically active compound may be used in the form of either free base or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof. Examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt of diltiazem include inorganic acid addition salts such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, nitrate or perchlorate and organic acid addition salts such as acetate, oxalate, malonate, tartrate, citrate, lactate or. aspartate. The dose of the pharmaceutically active compound to be used together with diltiazem or an acid addition salt thereof is not critical, but is preferably used within its usual dosage range.

On the other hand, diltiazem or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof to be used for enhancing the absorption of the pharmaceutically active compound is preferably used at a dose of 5 to 500 mg day body, especially 20 to 360 mg day body. The pharmaceutically active compound having an absolute oral bioavailability of not more than 20 t and diltiazem or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof should preferably be used within the weight ratio of from 1 200 to 100 1, especially from 1 100 to 50 1, more especially from 2 100 to 20 1.For example, the preferred weight ratio of said pharmaceutically active compound to diltiazem or a salt thereof can be shown illustratively as follows from 0.2 1 to 3 1, especially from 0.25 1 to 0.75 1 for propranolol or its salt from 0.1 1 to 3.0 1, especially from 0.2 1 to 2 1 for alprenolol or its salt from 2 1 to 40 1, especially from 2 1 to 10 1 for dopamine or its salt from 1 1 to 100 1, especially from 1 1 to 25 1 for N N acetylalany 3, 4 diethoxycarboxyphenethylamine from 1 1 to 100 1, especially from 1 1 to 25 1 for N Nacetylmethionyl 3,4 diethoxycarboxyphenethylamine from 0.04 1 to 0.8 1, especially from 0.06 1 to 0.2 1 for diazepam or its salt from 0.08 1 to 3 1, especially from 0.1 1 to 0.8 1 for isosorbide dinitrate from 0.1 1 to 1 1, especially from 0.14 1 to 0.5 1 forO 3,4 dimethOxyphenethylaminomethyl 4 hydroxybenzylalcohol or its salt from 0.12 1 to 0.8 1, especially from 0.17 1 to 0.5 1 for o 3, 4 dimethoxyphenethylaminomethyl 3 hydroxy benzylalcohol or its salt from 0.12 1 to 1 1, especially from 0.17 1 to 0.5 1 for Dr C methyl 3, 4, 5 trimethoxy phenethylamino methyl 2 hydroxybenzylalcohol or its salt from 0.02 1 to 0.8 1, especially from 0.03 1 to 0.2 1 for trimethoquinol or its salt from 0.024 1 to 0.4 1, especially from 0.03 1 to 0.1 1 for 1 3,4,5 trimethcxy benzyl 5, 7 dihydroxy 1, 2, 314 tetrahydroisoquinol.ine or its salt from 0.2 1 to 6 1, especially from 0.25 1 to 1.5 1 for carbazochrome alkali metal sulfonate from 0.18 1 to 18 1, especially from 0.25 1 to 4.5 1 for timepidium halide and from 0.3 1 to 14 1, especially from 0.4 1 to 4 1 for tipepidine or its salt The pharmaceutically active compound having an absolute oral bioavailability of not more than 20 and diltiazem or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof may be administered to a warm blooded animal including man through conventional enteral route, for example, by oral route or rectal route. Further, these components may be administered in the form of a conventional preparation, for example, in a solid dosage form such as tablets, pills, powders, granules or suppositories or in a liquid dosage form such as solutions, syrups, emulsions, elixirs, suspensions or lemonades. In formulating these preparations, there may be used a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent such as binders e.g., syrup, arabic gum, gelatin, sorbit, tragacanth, polyvinylpyrrolidone , diluents lactose, sucrose, corn starch, calcium phosphate, sorbit , lubricants e.g., magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol, silica , disintegrators e.g., corn starch , wetting agents e.g., sodium lauryl sulfate and suppository bases e.g., cacao butter, laurin butter, polyethylene glycol e.g., macrogol , glycerinated gelatin, triglyceride of saturated fatty acids C12 C18 e.g., Witepsol . Flavoring agents, sweetening agents or coloring agents may also be added thereto. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention may be in the form of a single preparation containing both the pharmaceutically active compound and diltiazem or its salt. Alternatively, each components of the invention, i.e., the pharmaceutically active compound and diltiazem or its salt, may be formulated into separate preparations to be used simultaneously for. patients, e.g., into a unit dosage pack containing each components separately. Diltiazem or a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof can enhance the absorption of a pharmaceutically active compound insofar as said pharmaceutically active compound is the one having an absolute bioavailability of not more than 20 , and hence, can increase the concentration of said pharmaceutically active compound in blood. Therefore, diltiazem or its salt when administered enterally together with the pharmaceutically active compound can improve the bioavailability of said pharmaceutically active compound and can also reduce doses of said co administered active compound.The simultaneous administration of the pharmaceutically active compound and diltiazem or its salt is further advantageous to reduce inter individual variation in the pharmacological effect of the pharmaceutically active compound, whereas oral administration of the pharmaceutically active compound sometimes brings about large variation in the pharmacological effects thereof between each patients due to difference in the bioa vailability thereof. Additionally, the simultaneous administration of propranolol adrenergic 9 blocking agent and diltiazem may be advantageous for treatment of coronary heart diseases e.g., angina pectoris in that both of the decrease in cardiac output caused by propranolol and the coronary vasodilating action of diltiazem serves to improve the disease state of patients.Further, the simultaneous administration of D 3, 4 dimethoxyphenethylaminomethyl 4 hydroxybenzylalcohol cardiotonic agent and diltiazem is advantageous for treatment of patients without undesirable effects on heart rate because a possible increase in heart rate caused by the former compound is compensated by diltiazem. The present invention is illustrated by the followingExperiments and Examples but should not be construed to be limited thereto.Experiment 1 The experiment was performed in 10 patients with ischemic heart disease. 20 mg of propranolol hydroxhloride and 30 mg of diltiazem hydrochloride were administered orally to the patients 3 times daily for 4 days. As a result, the mean steady state plasma concentration of propranolol measured on the last day of the experiment was 34.7 ng ml. On the other hand, when 20 mg of propranolol hydrochloride were administered orally to the same patients 3 times daily for 4 days, the mean steady state plasma concentration of propranolol measured on the last day of the experiment was 24.7 ng ml. It is clear from the above mentioned results that the plasma concentration of proterenolol was increased by the simultaneous administration of diltiazem hydrochloride.Experiment 2 The experiment was. performed in 4 male beagle dogs mean body weight 12 kg fasted for 24 hours. 40 mg of propranolol hydrochloride were administered orally to the beagle dogs. After one week interval, 40 mg of propranolol hydrochloride and 30 mg of diltiazem hydrochloride were administered orally to the same beagle dogs. After another one week, 40 mg of propranolol hydrochloride and 60 mg of diltiazem hydrochloride were administered orally to the same beagle dogs. The plasma propranolol concentration was examined at intervals. The results are shown in the followingTable 1. It is clear from Table 1 that diltiazem hydrochloride enhanced the absorption of propranolol hydrochloride.
