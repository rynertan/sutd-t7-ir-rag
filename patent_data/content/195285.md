# MOLECULAR CLONING OF THE DELTA ENDOTOXIN GENE OF BACILLUS THURIGIENSIS VAR. ISRAELENSIS

## Abstract
A recombinant vector capable of replicating in a microor ganism host, in which the vector contains expressible heterologous genetic information coding for a protein hav ing toxic properties of Ïƒ endotoxin from Bacillus thuringien sis var israelensis, is disclosed along with isolated DNA and RNA coding for the protein, transformed microorganisms containing the vector, the toxic protein itself, and methods of using the toxic protein as an insecticide.
