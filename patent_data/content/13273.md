# Auxiliary commutation circuit for an inverter.

## Abstract
A supplemental or auxiliary portion 52,56,58,60 of the commutation circuit for an inverter is actuated only during overload conditions which improve the inverter efficiency during normal load conditions. A control circuit responds to the increased time period of the commutation pulse to delay the firing of the thyristors which initiate the makeup pulse. This modified operation continues for at least three commuta tion cycles in order to ensure that the supplemental portion of the commutation circuit is properly initialized so that it is ready for subsequent overcurrent conditions.
