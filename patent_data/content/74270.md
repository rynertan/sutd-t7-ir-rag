# Process and apparatus for continuous steel making.

## Abstract
The invention provides an arrangement for steelmaking comprising a steel melt and initial reaction chamber arranged to receive source material in the form of scrap and or pre reduced iron, an overhead lance for the introduc tion of an oxidising gas to the initial reaction chamber, means for introducing, below the level of the surface of the melt in the reaction chamber, a melt stirring fluid medium, means for introducing carbonaceous material into the melt a secondary refining chamber connecting with the initial reaction chamber at the surface level of the melt and through which the metal is arranged to pass from the initial reaction chamber and a melt holding vessel into which the metal is passed from the secondary refining chamber.
