# COMPOSITION AND METHOD FOR THE DETECTION OF BACTERIA

## Abstract
A composition and a method for the detection of bacteria in specimen samples, e.g. biological fluids, are disclosed. The composition comprises a metabolizable substrate e.g. glu cose and a benzindole dye which undergoes a detectable co lor change when incubated in admixture with a bacterial micro organism. Useful dyes include particular benz cd indole, benz e indole and benz g indole compounds. Detection of bacteria can be accomplished by bringing the composition or an element containing the composition into contact with a specimen sample. This invention is particularly useful in detec tion of significant bacteriuria.
