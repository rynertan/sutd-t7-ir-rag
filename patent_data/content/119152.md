## Description
FUEL EFFICIENT TIRE This invention relates to a radial tire with improved fuel economy. With the high cost of fuel for vehicles, for example those containing internal combustion engines, including passenger cars and trucks, it is important that various means be taken to improve fuel economy. It would be extremely desirable to have radial passenger and truck tires which have reduced rolling resistance and as a result improved fuel economy. It would be even more desirable that such a tire would provide improved fuel economy without substantial sacrifices in the performance and durability characteristics of the tire. It is an object of this invention to provide a pneumatic radial tire which will provide improved fuel economy and reduced rolling resistance. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a fuel efficient tire without substantial sacrifices in tire performance and or durability. Other objects will become apparent as this description proceeds. In accordance with one aspect of this invention, there is provided a fuel efficient tire having the following characteristics a. an aspect ratio of from 85 to 120 , preferably 85 to 100 , b. a tread width of from 70 to 115 , preferably 70 to 85 , of the bead width, c. a tread thickness of from 3 to 5 of the section height, d. a tread shoulder gauge of from 4 to 7 of the section height, and e. a tread with a hot resilience from 70 to 80 , a cold resilience from 60 to 70 . The figure is a cross sectional view of a tire constructed according to the practice of the present invention. In the figure, there is illustrated the tire 1, the tread 2, the base 3, the shoulder wedge 4, the carcass 5, the sidewall 6, the bead area 7, the outer sidewall 8 and the belt package 9. While the shoulder wedge 4 and the base 3 are preferable, they are not necessary parts of the construction. In preferred embodiments the tire possesses a tread base 3 and or shoulder wedges 4. In other preferred embodiments, the tread base 3, when present, and or outer sidewall 8 and or wedges 4, when present, have a hot resilience from 85Z to 95 and a cold resilience from 77 to 87 . The hot resilience of the carcass stock is preferably 55X to 70 , while the cold resilience of the carcass stock is preferably 65 to 80 . The dynamic modulus of the tread is preferably 50 2 2 to 180 Kg cm , and most preferably 50 to 80 Kg cm The dynamic modulus of the base, outer sidewall and wedges are preferably 35 to 60 Kg cm2. The dynamic modulus of the carcass stock is 2 preferably 60 to 300 Kg cm Also in a preferred embodiment, the width of the bead area, i.e., the bead thickness BT is 50 to 100 of the tread thickness, preferably 50 to 75 . Also preferred is a tire of the present invention with a total sidewall thickness ST which is reasonably uniform from one end of the sidewall area to the other.Preferably the thickness at any point in the sidewall area does not vary by more than 20 from any of the other points in the sidewall area. The total sidewall thickness includes the outer sidewall, the carcass plies and any component inside the carcass plies including the inner liner, if an inner liner is used. As used herein, the bead area 7 is the area of the tire encompassed by the lower 25 of the section height. The sidewall area is the area of the tire encompassed by the middle 50 of the section height. The aspect ratio is the ratio of the section heightSH, which is the perpendicular distance from the nominal rim diameter base line, NRD, to the top of the carcass at a point immediately below the center of the crown of the tire, to the section width SW, which is the maximum width of the tire as measured from the carcass in one sidewall to the carcass in the other sidewall. The tread width TW is the width of the footprint of the tire when inflated and under normal load. The bead width BW is the axial distance between the center of the bead bundles in the two bead areas of the tire. The tread thickness TT is the distance from the outer surface of the tread at the tread centerline perpendicularly to the top carcass ply.The tread shoulder gauge SG is the distance from the tread edge, as determined from the footprint, to the point where a line passing through the tread edge point to the inner surface of the tire at an angle of 900 to the inner surface of the tire, intersects the inner surface of the tire. All of the tire dimensions referred to herein are dimensions taken on an inflated tire under no load, with the exception of the tread width which is the width of the tread footprint when the tire is inflated and under normal load. Other than the particular structural dimensions and physical properties recited earlier herein for the tire of the present invention, all other features of the tire can be conventional in nature. For example, whether the tire possesses cut or folded belts, one carcass ply or a multi ply carcass, or any other conventional construction features, it will benefit by the practice of the present invention. Also, regardless of the fabric or wire used in the tire, whether steel, polyaramid, nylon, etc., the tire will benefit by the practice of the present invention. In addition, any conventional compound can be used in the various components of the tire so long as the resilience and modulus properties recited earlier herein are present. The following formulations can be used in the below designated components of the tire to provide a dynamic modulus and resilience within the broadest ranges recited earlier herein. These formulations do not limit but merely illustrate formulations which can be used.

The hot resilience is measured at 1000C. and the cold resilience is measured at room temperature. Dynamic modulus as recited herein is measured at a frequency of 60 hertz and a temperature of 212 F. Tires conforming to the practice of the present invention not only possess improved rolling resistance and fuel economy, but in addition provide reasonable tire performance and durability. In fact, a vehicle having four experimental tires conforming to the practice of the present invention won the 1981 FutureFuels Challenge Rally. While all types of tires including passenger and truck tires will benefit by the practice of the present invention, the benefits are particularly beneficial to truck tires, whether medium or heavy. For purposes of this invention, light truck tires are those with Tire and Rim Association 1982 inflation load ratios psi pounds of 30 1000 to 105 3417 211 454 to 2 738 1551 Kg mm Kg and medium and heavy truck tires are those with an inflation load rating of from 65 2460 to 120 9230 457 x 10 1l17 to 844 x 10 4 4190 2Kg mm Kg for conventional constructions and 30 3600 to 105 10970 211 x 10 4 1634 to 738 x 10 4 4980 Kg mmê Kg for wide base constructions, the medium truck sizes including 7.50 through 11.50 20 and the heavy truck sizes including 12.00 20 and larger sizes. The method by which the tire is manufactured is not important to the practice of the invention. While certain representative embodiments and details have been shown for the purpose of illustrating the invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in this art that various changes and modifications may be made therein. For example, while the base has been shown to be positioned under only a portion of the cap, it may proceed across the entire crown beneath the entire cap.In either case it provides minimized internal heat build up. The wedges are conventionally positioned underneath the edges of the belt package and provide shear modulus transition between a high modulus belt ending and a low modulus carcass ply line.
