# Sheet feeding apparatus.

## Abstract
Sheet feeding apparatus for a sheet feeder utilizing a cassette sheet supply of more than one sheet size compris ing a rotatable feed roll shaft 75 having one feed roll 76 permanently attached at one end and a second axially movably mounted feed roll 82 on the other end of the shaft with a yoke means 85 to axially move the roll. The feeding apparatus is used with a sheet cassette 61 which, when inserted in the sheet supply station, engages positioning means 88 responsive to the insertion of the cassette which thereby automatically positions the movable feed roll 82 so that both feed rolls are positioned substantially the same distance from the sheet edge irrespective of the size of the sheet material. In this manner the sheet feeding apparatus automatically adjusts itself for feeding sheets of various sizes.
