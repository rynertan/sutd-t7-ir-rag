# Fibrous composite materials and the production and use thereof.

## Abstract
A fibrous composite material in the form of individual fibres, sheets, layers or lightweight blocks comprising non combustible fibres and lamellae of a layer mineral, a method for the manufacture of the fibrous composite materials by applying lamellae of a layer mineral to the fibres preferably from suspension followed by removal of the liquid phase of the suspension, and use of the fibrous composite materials for the fire protection of substrates.
