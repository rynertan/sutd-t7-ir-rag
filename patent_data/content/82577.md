## Description
FUNGICIDAL COMPOSITION AND METHOD OF COMBATING FUNGAL GROWTH This invention relates to fungicidal compositions and a method of combating fungal growth. N hydroxy N formylalanine and its salts and esters are useful as fungicides, as disclosed in European Patent ApplicationPublication No. 0057027. N trichloromethylthio phthalimide is a knawn fungicide useful, for example, against grape disease. It has been shown that if applied under certain conditions, while acting as an effective fungicide N hydroxy N formylalanine and its salts and esters can be harmful to plants a high dosage can cause scare phytotoxicity on leaves directly sprayed. The Applicants have naw found that mixtures of N hydroxy N formylalanine or its salts and esters with N trichiorarethyl thio phthalimide give unexpectedly effective control of fungi together with negligible phytotoxicity. The present invention therefore provides a fungicidal composition which comprises a compound I which is N hydroxy N formylalanine, which has the formulaEMI1.1 or a salt or an ester thereof, together with compound II, N trichloromethylthio phtlalimide, which has the formulaEMI2.1 A salt of the acid I may contain the monovalent anion in which the carboxyl group is ionised or the divalent anion in which the N hydroxy group is also ionised.Polyvalent metal ions generally form salts with, or chelates derived from, the divalent anion, while monovalent metal ions can form mono or divalent salts. leak bases in general form only ironovalent salts. Typical metal salts include salts of lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, zinc, copper, lead, manganese or iron. Typical non netal salts include ammonium and substituted ammonium salts, for example those in which the cation has the formula Ã¤NR4R5R6R7 in which each of R4, R5, R6 and R7 independently represents a hydrogen atom or an optionally substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl group having up to 12 carbon atoms.Optional substituents include for example halogen atoms and alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, hydroxy, cyano, nitro, amino, carboxy, alkoxycarbonyl, phenyl and phenoxy groups, any alkyl moiety present preferably having up to 4 carbon atoms. Further suitable substituted ammonium salts include those in which the nitrogen atom forms part of a saturated or unsaturated ring, which may also contain one or more additional hetero atoms, epsecially nitrogen, oxygen and or sulphur atoms. Typical salts of this type are pyridinium, pyrrolidinium, piperidinium and itorpholinium salts. Further suitable salts include those with polyrreric substances containing basic groups, such as ion exchange resins.Such salts can be especially useful in applications where insoluble materials are required. Suitable esters of the acid I include optionally substituted alkyl, cycloalkyl and aryl esters, where the preferred optional substituents are as described above.Preferred esters are unsubstituted alkyl esters preferably having up to 4 carbon atoms in the alkyl toiety. Especially preferred for use in the invention are compo simians containing salts of the free acid I, the most prefered salt being the mono sodium salt. It will be appreciated that the canFctnds I I contain an asym metric carbon atom and hence will exist in two optically isareric forms. Both optical isarers, together with mixtures of these isomers, such as racernic mixtures, may be used in this invention. The weight ratio of the compound I to the compound II may vary widely depending on the intended application. For example said ratio may be in the range of from 1 20 to 20 1, especially 5 1 to 1 5. Suitably the dosage of each compound applied is in the range of fran 0.05 to 4kg ha. For example a dosage of 0.05 to 2.5kg ha, especially 0.2 to 1.0kg ha, of the compound I may be applied together with 0.05 to 4kg ha especially 0.5 to 2.0kg ha, of compound II. In another aspect, the invention also provides a method for combating fungus at a locus, which osmprises treating the locus with a compound I and carpound II as defined above. The present invention is of wide applicability in the protection of crop plants against fungal attack, for example plants susceptible to downy mildews. The present invention is of particular value in the protection of vines against vine downy mildew, Plasmopara viticola. The fungicidal composition of the invention preferably also contains a carrier. A carrier in a composition according to the invention is any material with which the active ingredients are formulated to facilitate application to the locus to be treated, which may for example be a plant, seed or soil, or to facilitate storage, transport or handling. A carrier may be a solid or a liquid, including a material which is normally gaseous but which has been compressed to form a liquid, and any of the carriers normally used in formulating fungicidal compositions may be used.Suitable carriers for use in the carpositions according to the invention are in general the same carriers useful for formulating the compounds I alone. Preferably the compositions according to the invention contain from 0.5 to 95 by weight of total active ingredient. Suitable solid carriers include natural silicas such as diatomaceous earths magnesium silicates, for example talcs magnesium aluminium silicates, for example attapulgites and vermiculites aluminium silicates, for example kaolinites, montmorillonites and micas calcium carbonate calcium sulphate ammonium sulphate synthetic hydrated silicon oxides and synthetic calcium or aluminium silicates elements, for example carbon and sulphur natural and synthetic resins, for example couma one resins, polyvinyl chloride, and styrene polymers and copolymers solid polychlorophenols bitumen waxes, for example beeswax, paraffin wax, and chlorinated mineral waxes and solid fertilisers, for example superphosphates. Suitable liquid carriers include water alcohols, for example isopropanol and glycols ketones, for example acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclchexanone ethers aromatic or araliphatic hydrocarbons, for example benzene, toluene and xylene petroleum fractians, for example kerosine and light mineral oils chlorinated hydrocarbons, for example carbon tetrachloride, perchloroethylene and trichloroethane. Mixtures of different liquids are often suitable. Fungicidal carpositions are often formulated and transported in a concentrated form which is subsequently diluted by the user before application. The presence of small amounts of a carrier which is a surface active agent facilitates this process of dilution. Thus preferably at least one carrier in a composition according to the invention is a surface active agent. For example, a composition may contain at least two carriers, at least one which is a surface active agent. A surface active agent may be an emulsifying agent, a dispersing agent or a wetting agent it may be nonionic or ionic.Examples of suitable surface active agents include the sodium or calcium salts of polyacrylic acids and lignin sulphonic acids the condensation products of fatty acids or aliphatic amines or amides containing at least 12 carbon atoms in the molecule with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide fatty acid esters of glycerol, sorbitan, sucrose or pentaerythritol condensates of these with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide condensation products of fatty alcohol or alkyl phenols, for example Er octylphenol or Eroctylcresol, with ethylene oxide and or propylene oxide sulphates or sulphonates of these condensation products alkali or alkaline earth metal salts, preferably sodium salts, of sulphuric or sulphonic acid esters containing at least 10 carbon atoms in the molecule, for example sodium lauryl sulphate, sodium secondary alkyl sulphates, sodium salts of sulphonated castor oil, and sodium alkylaryl sulphonates such as sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate and polymers of ethylene oxide and copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. The carpositions of the invention may for example be formulated as wettable powders, dusts, granules, solutions, emulsifi able concentrates, emulsions, suspension concentrates and aerosols. Wettable powders usually contain 25, 50 or 75 w of active ingredient and usually contain, in addition to solid inert carrier, 3 10tw of a dispersing agent and, where necessary, 0 lOUw of stabiliser s and or other additives such as penetrants or stickers.Dusts are usually formulated as a dust concentrate having a similar composition to that of a wettable powder but without a dispersant, and may be diluted in the field with further solid carrier to give a composition usually containing 10 w of active ingredient. Granules are usually prepared to have a size between 10 and 100 BS mash 1.676 0.152 mm , and may be manufactured by agglomeration or impregnation techniques.Generally, granules will contain 25 w active ingredient and 0lO w of additives such as stabilisers, slow release modifiers and binding agents. Emulsifiable concentrates usually contain, in addition to a solvent and, when necessary, co solvent, 10 50 w v active ingredient, 2 20 w v emulsifiers and 0 20 w v of other additives such as stabilisers, penetrants and corrosion inhibitors.Suspension concentrates are usually confounded so as to obtain a stable, non sedimenting flowable product and usually contain 10 75 w active ingredient, 0.5 15 w of dispersing agents, 0.1 10 w of suspending agents such as protective colloids and thixotropic agents, 0 10 w of other additives such as deformers, corrosion inhibitors, stabilisers, penetrants and stickers, and water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is substantially insoluble certain organic solids or inorganic salts may be present. dissolved in the formulation to assist in preventing sedimentation or as antifreeze agents for water. The compositions may also contain other ingredients, for example other compounds possessing pesticidal, especially insecticidal, acaricidal, herbicidal or fungicidal, properties. Aqueous dispersions and emulsions, for example compositions obtained by diluting a wettable powder or a concentrate according to the invention with water, also lie within the scope of the present invention. The said emulsions may be of the water in oil or of the oil in water type, and may have a thick mayonnaise like consistency. The following Examples illustrate the invention.EXAMPLE 1 The fungicidal and phytotoxic effects of the sodium salt of N hydroxy N fornylalanine in admixture with N trichloromethyl thio phthalimide were compared to those of the N hydroxy Nformylalanine salt alone using the following procedure. The test solutions were sprayed onto adult, fruit bearing grapevines cv Sauvignon at 18 day intervals during June, July and August.Four replicate plots were treated. Controls were left untreated. The test solutions contained the active ingredient s , distilled water and 100ppm of Tween 20 surfactant Trade mark . Seven days after the first spray application and 13 days after the third spray application the vines were innoculated with a spore suspension containing Plasmopara viticola. Assessments of the disease level and phytotoxicity were made 19 days after the 1st treatment, and then after a further 4 weeks 11 days after the 3rd treatment . The results of this test are shown in Table 1. The extent of disease control in the test is expressed as a percentage of the disease level occuring on the control vines. Phytotoxicity is expressed as a irean rating oompared with the control according to the criteria, 0 absolutely no phytotoxicity 1 doubtful occurence of phytotoxicity 2 distinct, but very slight phytotoxicity 3,4 slight to moderate phytotoxicity 5 phytotoxicity of an unacceptable degree. It can be seen from the results in Table I that the addition of N trichlomethylthio phthalimide to a given dosage of the sodium salt of N hydroxy N formylalanine reduced the slight phytotoxicity occuring to a very low level indeed. Disease control by the mixture was very good.

After the spray had dried, the discs were inoculated with Plasmopara viticola. The dishes were closed and incubated for 7 days at 210C. At the end of this period, the percentage area of each disc covered with sporulating downy mildew was estimated, and compared with that on inoculated, untreated control discs. The test results are given in Table 2. In this Table, the theorectical degree of disease suppression, assuming that the two fungicides act independently i.e. additively is calculated using the formula Theorectical value x y lO0 x of disease suppressian 100 where x and y are the activities of the two components used separately. If the actual degree of disease suppression as measured in the test is greater than the calculated value, then the two fungicides have interacted synergistically. Examination of the results in Table 2 show that in all cases, the actual degree of disease suppression is greater than the calculated degree, indicating synergistic action of the two test materials.
