# Process for preparing cast film of thermoplastic resin.

## Abstract
A process for preparing a thermoplastic resin film by extruding a molten thermoplastic film forming resin in the form of a continuous molten film onto an electrically grounded moving quenching surface, passing the molten film in proxim ity to but out of contact with at least one electrode which imparts an electrostatic charge to the film across its full width and withdrawing a solidified film thus formed from said quenching surface which process comprises extruding the molten film onto a quenching surface characterized by having a channel like microcracked structure.
