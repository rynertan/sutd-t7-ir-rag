# Method for depositing silicon or germanium containing films.

## Abstract
The films 10 are formed on a substrate 9 by means of chemical vapor deposition where a gas atmosphere contain ing at least one silane or germane of a higher order is used. The gases forming the gas atmosphere are supplied to a region adjacent to the substrate 9 and an excitation energy is applied to those gases preferably with a glow discharge being generated. At least when the gas atmosphere additionally contains a gas reacting with the silane or the germane respec tively the pressure of the reactive gases is kept below 0.133 mbar. The films 10 formed consist of silicon or germanium respectively, or of compounds or alloys of these elements with oxygen, nitrogen, carbon and boron depending on the nature of the additionally available reactive gases. The films 10 preferably hydrated are useful in semiconducting devices.
