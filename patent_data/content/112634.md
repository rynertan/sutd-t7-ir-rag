# Ceramic monolith particulate filter trap support.

## Abstract
A particulate trap 20 for use in the exhaust system of a diesel engine to effect removal of particulates from the ex haust gases discharged from the engine, has a trap housing 21 with an exhaust inlet 32 at one end and an exhaust outlet 34 at its opposite end with at least one ceramic mo nolith wall flow particulate filter 10 having an inlet end 16 and an outlet end 17 positioned in the trap housing 21 by a tubular support member 36 having a compressible mat 40 of refractory material sandwiched between it and a por tion of said particulate filter 10 next adjacent to the outlet end 17 thereof in a manner to prevent bypass flow from said exhaust inlet 32 around said particulate filter 10 to the exhaust outlet 34 , at least 50 of the exterior surface of the particulate filter 10 next adjacent to its inlet end 16 being in spaced apart relationship to the trap housing 21 so as to define a passage in flow communication with the in coming exhaust gases whereby these gases will heat the exterior of the filter 10 next adjacent to the inlet end 16 thereof so as to effect a reduction of the thermal stress on the particulate filter 10 during engine operation. This sup port arrangement also reduces radial and axial stress on this exposed end of the filter.
