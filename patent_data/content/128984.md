# Process for the production of para vinyl phenol by dehydrogenation of para ethyl phenol.

## Abstract
A process for the production of p vinyl phenol by the dehydrogenation of p ethyl phenol in a gaseous phase in the presence of a catalyst and a diluent wherein the dehydrogena tion of p ethyl phenol is effected with phenol and or p cresol being present in the reaction system in an amount of 5 to 50 wt of the amount of p ethyl phenol.
