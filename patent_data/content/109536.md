## Abstract
Beam from a xenon flashed lamp 60 driven by a pulse drive system is guided through 12 illumination beam guiding optical fibers 64 , to illuminate a reaction liquid contained in 12 reaction cuvettes 70 with every 4 reaction cuvettes being located at each of 3 different measuring stations . Beam transmitted through the reaction liquid is so led as to be incident on 12 transmitted beam guiding optical fibers 80 . The beam emission ends of the transmitted beam guiding optical fibers 80 are inserted into a support member 82 at positions thereof which fall on a circle. The rotor 86 is rotated in conjunction with a shaft 84 . A pair of reflecting mirrors 88, 90 are secured to the rotor 86 and shaft 84 , respectively. Beams emitted from the transmitted beam guiding optical fibers 80 are independently and consecutively led along the same optical path, to a pair of slit members 92, 96 disposed on the side of the rotor opposite the support member 82 , while the rotor completes one rotation. Beam passed through the slit members 92, 96 is diffracted by a diffraction grating 98 , and diffracted beams are detected by photo detector array 100 .
