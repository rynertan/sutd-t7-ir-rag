# Catalyst for production of unsaturated carboxylic acid, preparation thereof and production of unsaturated carboxylic acid.

## Abstract
An improved catalyst suitable for use in the production of an unsaturated carboxylic acid by the catalytic vapor phase oxidation of an unsaturated aldehyde is provided. In this catalyst, a heat resistant inorganic substance, such as alumina, silica alumina and silicon carbide, having a particle diameter of 3 through 10mm, an apparent porosity of 35 through 60 , a water absorption of 20 through 50 , an aver age pore diameter of not less than 40 microns, a specific surface area of not more than 2 mÂ² g and a bulk specific gravity of 1.5 through 2.0 is used for supporting a composition containing molybdenum, phosphorous, vanadium and the alkali metals. The use of the above mentioned carrier results in the advantages that the unsaturated carboxylic acid, such as methacrylic acid, can be selectively produced from the unsaturated aldehyde at a high yield and that the mechanical strength of the catalyst is remarkably improved.
