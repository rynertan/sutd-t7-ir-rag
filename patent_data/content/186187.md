## Description
The present invention relates to cephalosporin derivatives, processes for their preparation and antibacterial agents containing them as active ingredients. Since β lactam antibiotics exhibit selective toxicity only against bacteria and present no substantial effects against animal cells, they have performed important roles as antibiotics with no substantial side effects in the prevention or treatment of diseases caused by the infection of bacteria. Particularly, cephalosporin derivatives are generally stable against penicillinase and have a broad antibacterial spectrum, and thus they are frequently employed for the prevention and treatment of diseases caused by the infection of bacteria. As published technical disclosures which describe cephalosporin derivatives having a quaternary ammonium salt substructure, there may be mentioned Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Nos. 53690 1978, 59196 1980, 174387 1983, 198490 1983 and 219292 1984 equivalent to EP 121244 . At present, cephalosporin derivatives referred to as the third generation, such as Cefotaxime Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, Ceftazidime Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, EP 121244 discloses a compound having a monosubstituted or unsubstituted isoindoliniummethyl group at the 3 sidechain of the cephem nucleus. However, the existing third generation cephalosporins in general have relatively poor antibacterial activities against resistant Staphylococcus having various resistant mechanisms, or against glucose non fermentative Gram negative rods such as resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Further, the above mentioned Ceftazidime is not necessarily satisfactory because of existence of resistant bacteria. Accordingly, a novel cephalosporin derivative having a more potent and broader antibacterial spectrum is desired for the curing of obstinate infectious diseases caused by such bacteria. As mentioned above, cephalosporin derivatives of the so called third generation, such as Cefotaxime exhibit relatively poor antibacterial activities against Gram positive bacteria, and excellent activities against Gram negative bacteria, particularly against Enterobacteriacae, but few of them exhibit satisfactory antibacterial activities against Pseudomonads and Acinetobacters. Accordingly, a more powerful and effective medicine is desired for the treatment of serious diseases caused by the infection of these bacteria or by the mixed infection of these bacteria and other bacteria. The present inventors have conducted extensive reserches on novel cephem compounds having a 2 methyl substituted 2 isoindolinium methyl group at the 3 position of the cephem, and have found that compounds in which at least two substituents such as a hydroxy group and an acetoxy group are incorporated in an isoindoline ring exhibit remarkably strong antibacterial activities against Gram negative bacteria, particularly against glucose non fermentative Gram negative rods such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia and the like, as compared with compounds in which the isoindoline ring is unsubstituted, monohydroxy substituted, monoacetoxy substituted or monomethoxy substituted. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this discovery. The present invention provides a compound having the formula wherein R¹ is a straight chain, branched chain or cyclic C₁ ₆ alkyl group which may be substituted by a carboxyl group, and each of R² and R³ which may be the same or different, is a hydroxyl group or an acetoxy group, and R⁴ is a hydrogen atom, a hydroxy group or an acetoxy group or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, physiologically hydrolyzable ester or solvate thereof. The compounds of the present invention exhibit superior antibacterial activities against sensitive strains of these bacteria as compared with Ceftazidime, and also exhibit excellent antibacterial activities against Ceftazidime resistant Pseudomonas and Acinetobactor. Among such compounds, compounds having a 2 2 aminothiazol 4 yl 2 substituted oxyiminoacetamido group as a side chain at the 7 position and a 2 methyl 5,6 disubstituted isoindolinium methyl at 3 position are particularly excellent in antibacterial activities. Generally, the substitution of an oxyimino group may take a E form or a Z form in the geometrical isomerism. However, the substitution of the oxyimino group in the acylamino moiety at the 7 position of the compound of the formula I has a Z form.

When a hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate or acetate is used as the amine salt, the reaction is usually conducted in the presence of a tertiary amine such as triethylamine in an amount sufficient for neutralization. As the solvent, there may be employed a non aqueous organic solvent such as methylenechloride, chloroform, ether, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, N,N dimethylformamide or dimethylsulfoxide, or a mixture thereof.
