## Description
CARTO W CLOoEit This invention relates to a carton closer, primarily for closing cartons of the end loading type, for example as described in GE PS 1 424 035. One object of the invention is to provide a carton closer that does not need a conveyor with lugs to propel the cartons past flap detecting ploughs and possiby also tuckers and or gluing means. Another object of the invention is to provide a carton closer that does not need any timed in feed mechanism. A further object of the invention is to provide a carton closer that holds each carton firmly and squarely whilst passing flap deflecting ploughs and possibly also tuckers and or glueing means. Yet another object of the invention is to provide a carton closer in which successive cartons can be touching each other or may proceed in very close relationship. A still further object of the invention is to provide a carton closer that is very readily adjustable to suit a change in the size of cartons. According to the present invention, a carton closer comprises a base, at least one pair of endless belts mounted on rollers on the base with mutually opposed forwarding runs of the belts spaced parallel to each other adjacent a feed path for cartons along the base, the outer surfaces of the endless belts having a high coefficient of friction, drive means for at least one roller for each belt and adapted to drive the belts at the same speed, and flap deflecting ploughs adjacent one side of the space between the forwarding runs of the endless belts. A carton having a width equal to the space between the forwarding runs of the endless belts can be fed without any precise timing into the space, the carton being held firmly and squarely by the friction surfaces of the belts as they move at the same speed past the flap deflecting ploughs, and successive cartons can be fed in close succession to preceding cartons and or with any spacing therefrom. The endless belts with their respective rollers are preferably adjustable towards and away from each other, for ready adjustment of the space between the forwarding runs to suit a change in the size e.g.width of cartons and adjustable stop means is preferably provided to ensure a minimum adjusted space is maintained throughout the length of the forwarding runs. Each endless belt may be duplicated, on common rollers or on separate rollers on common shafts, to provide one pair of belts adjacent the closed end or bottom of the cartons and one pair of belts adjacent the open end or top to be closed of the cartons. The belts may consist of reinforced rubber i.e. inextensible belts with unplasti cise d po lyv inylchl or i de PVC providing the high friction surfaces, the opposite inner surfaces being ribbed transversely to form teeth engageable with teeth on the rollers. The axes of the rollers on which the endless belts are mounted may be vertical or horizontal or inclined e.g. slightly to the horizontal , to suit any disposition of cartons from a product loader, and if horizontal or slightly inclined thereto the lower belt may be longer than the upper belt so as to afford at least a lead in to the space betwecn the forwarding runs, but a guide rail is in any case preferably provided for cartons entering the space, the guide rail being disposed adjacent the side of the space remote from the flap deflecting ploughs. The guide rail or a leading part of it is preferably adjustable towards and away from the side of the space with the flap deflecting ploughs, for ready adjustment to suit a change in the size e.g. depth of cartons. For use with c artons having mechanically closed side flaps e.g., tucked in or locked , flap deflecting ploughs may suffice, but tuckers may be required for end flaps or tabs , and the leading end flaps or tabs may have a lessee width than the trailing end flaps or tabs or cutouts therein to afford clearance for tuckers past or through leading end flaps in contact with or close to trailing end flaps for deflecting of the latter by the tuckers on closely adjacent successive cartons, the leading end flaps conveniently being deflected by a spear carried by one of the side flap deflecting ploughs. For use with cartons having adhesively bonded side flaps, gl u ei n g means may be provided, which may be an adhesive applicator of wheel, spray or other type , which may be followed by an adhesive conditioner of hot air, radiant heat or other type , or which may be an activator for adhesive already applied to on the or each side flap or for actuating suitable carton material to form a bond, the glueing means being followed by flap deflecting ploughs to bring the side flaps into contact with each other for bonding, and possibly followed by a rail or rolls for pressing the flaps together. The action of tuckers, whether oscillating or rotary including intermittently rotatable , may be timed by a photocell or other detector of the cartons, which timing means may control a valve or switch for a pneumatic or electrical actuator for the tuckers. The flap deflecting ploughs and or tuckers and or glueing means may be adjustable or interchangeable to suit changes in the size e.g. width and depth of cartons, and such adjustments, together with adjustments of the spacing of the endless belts and or the position of a guide rail, may be effected by means of handles, wheels or knobs, or by setting motors on the ends of adjusting screws or lead screw s, and or may be com put er controlled in accordance with a bar or other code on the cartons. An embodiment of the invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a diagrammatic side elevation of a carton closer in accordance with the invention Figure 2 is a diagrammatic end elevation of the carton closer from the lefthand end of Figure 1 Figure 3 is a detailed enlargement of part of the left hand end of Figure 1 Figure 4 is a fragmentary horizontal section taken generally from the line IV IV ofFigure 3 Figure 5 is a section corresponding toFigure 4 but at the same level at the righthand end of Figure 1 Figure 6 is a fragmentary plan view of details disposed midway between the upper parts of Figures 4 and 5 Figure 7 is a fragmentary horizontal section taken generally at a lower level at the right hand end of Figure 1 and to the same scale as Figure 5 Figure 8 is a fragmentary detailed enlarged vertical section taken from the lineVIII VIII of Figure 1 Figure 9 is a fragmentary enlarged plan view of the detail indicated by the arrowXI in Figure 1 Figure 10 is a detailed enlarged elevation of part of Figure 1 to the left of centre Figure 11 is a fragmentary vertical section taken from the line XI XI of Figure 10 and Figure 12 is a fragmentary vertical section taken from the line XII XII of Figure 10. The carton closer shown in the drawings comprises a base 20, upper and lower pairs of endless belts 21A, 21B and 22A, 22B respectively mounted on leading and return rollers 23, 24 and 25,26 respectively on the base with rílutually opposed forwarding runs 27 28 respectively of the belts spaced parallel to each other adjacent a feed path 29 for cartons 30 along the base, the outer surfaces FS of the endless belts having a high coefficient of friction, drive means 31, 32 respectively for the return rollers of the belts and adapted to drive the belts at the same speed, and flap deflecting ploughs 33, 34 adjacent one side of the space between the forwarding runs of the endless belts. A carton 30 having a width equal to the space between the forwarding runs 27, 28 of the endless belts can be fed without any precise timing into the space, the carton being held firmly and squarely by the friction surfaces of the belts as they move at the same speed past the flap deflecting ploughs 33, 34 and successive cartons can be fed in close succession to preceding cartons with spacing therefrom determined by the relatively slower peripheral speed of a pair of feed rollers 35, 36, the drives for which will be described presently. The flap deflecting ploughs 33, 34 serve to fold in lower and upper side flaps 37, 38 respectively of each carton 30, assisted by knife guides 39, 40 respectively. The endless belts 21A, 21B with their respective rollers 23, 25 are adjustable towards and away from the endless belts 22A, 22B, for ready adjustment of the space between the forwarding runs 27, 28 to suit a change in the width of cartons. For this purpose the rollers 23, 25 are carried by a beam structure 41 which can be raised and lowered by air cylinders 42, 43 carried by an upper frame part 44 of the base 20.The lower belts, 22A, 22B are on common rollers 24, 26 on shafts 45, 46 respectively, while the upper and narrower belts 21A, 21B are on separate rollers 23, 23X and 25, 25X on common shafts 47, 48 respectively, the rollers 23X, 25X being adjustable towards and away from the rollers 23, 25 by means to be described presently to suit a change in the depth of cartons and provide one pair of belts 21A, 22A adjacent the the open end of the cartons 30 and one pair of belts 21B, 22B adjacent the closed end of the cartons. The belts 21A, 21B, 22A, 22B are inextensible being formed of reinforced rubber with unplasticised polyvinylchoride PVC providing the friction surfaces FS, the opposite inner surfaces being ribbed transversely to form teeth 49 engageable With teeth 50 on the rollers 23, 23X, 24, 25, 25X, 26 . The axes of the rollers on which the endless belts are mounted are inclined slightly to the horizontal, to suite the disposition of the cartons 30 as they come from a product loader not shown , and the lower belts 22A, 22B are longer than the upper belts 21A, 21B so as to afford a lead in to the space between the forwarding runs 27, 28, but a guide rail 57 is in any case provided for cartons entering the space, the guide rail being disposed adjacent the side of the space remote from the flap deflecting ploughs 33, 34. A leading part not shown of the guide rail 57 is adjustable to suit a change in the depth of cartons. A tucker 52 is provided for trailing end flaps not shown of the cartons and the leading end flaps also not shown may have a lesser width than the trailing end flaps, or cutouts therein, to afford clearance for the tucker part or through leading end flaps in contact with or close to trailing end flaps on closely adjacent successive cartons, the leading end flaps conveniently being deflected by a spear also not shown carried by one of the side flap deflecting ploughs 33, 34.The rotary action of the tucker 52 by a stepping motor 53 is timed by a photocell detector 54 which detects the leading or trailing end flap of each carton. Gluing means 55, consisting of an adhesive wheel applicator applies adhesive to the lower side flap 37 of each carton 30 before the flap 37 is folded upwardly by the plough 33 assisted by the knife guide 39 , and the plough 34 assisted by the knife guide 40 folds the upper side flap 38 downwardly into contact with the glued lower flap 37. A rail 56 presses the flaps 37, 38 together over a sufficient period of travel of the carton 30 to ensure that the flaps are securely bonded together by the time the carton leaves the closer. The base 20 is supported by end frames 57, 58 having feet 59 and extending upwardly to the upper frame part 44, the end frame being tied together by lower longitudinal wembers 60 Figure 1 which support z pump unit 61 see also Figure 2 providing compressed air for the cylinders 42, 43. The base 20 includes lateral members 62, 63 and side plates 64, 65 Figures 7 and 8 supporting the rollers 24, 26 for thelower belts 22A, 22B, the upper runs 28 of which are backed by a sheet metal table 66 and guided by the upper edge portion of the front side plate 65 and a rail 67. The lower runs of the belts 22A, 22B are guided along a track formed by further sheet metal 68, the lower edge portion of the side plate 65 and a rail 69.The lower feed roller 36 is mounted on a shaft 70 with a toothed belt and pulley drive 71 from the shaft 45 of the roller 24, which is an idler roller, the belts 22A, 22B being driven by the drive means 32, which as can be seen particularly in Figure 3 consists of a stepping motor 72 and a toothed belt andpulley drive 73 to the shaft 46 of the roller 26. The beam structure 41 consists essentially of an elongate channel section 74 Figures 4 to 6 and 8 with brackets 75, 76 at its ends linked by T section members 77, 78 to the pistons not shown of the air cylinders 42, 43 respectively. Pairs of guide bars 79, 80 and 81, 82 extend forwardly frorn the brackets 75, 76 to a front side plate 83 to which are secured low friction tracks 84 for the front upper belt 21A, while a rear side plate 85 is slidable on the guide bars and has secured to it low friction tracks 86 for the rear upper belt 21 B. The guide rail 51 is also secured to the rear side plate 85. A stepping motor 87 Figure 6 only mounted in the channel section 74 is coupled to shafts 88, 89 which are in turn coupled to gear boxes 90, 91 respectively adapted to drive lead screws not visible of telescopic arms 92, 93, the outer ends of which are secured through universal joints 94, 95 to the upper rear side plate 85, whereby adjustment of the position of the rear upper belt 21B can be effected, which position is monitored by a sensor 96 coupled between the gearbox 90 and the adjacent end of the rear side plate 85.The rollers 23X, 25X are slidable along their respective shafts 47, 48, but the latter has a splined portion S and a correspondingly shaped bore in the boss 97 of the roller 25X tr an sm its the drive from th e drive means 31 which consists of a stepping motor 98 in phase with the motor 72 and a toothed beltand pulley drive 99. The lower feed roller 35 is mounted on a shaft 100 with a toothed belt and pulley drive 101 from the shaft 47 to which only the roller 23 is keyed. The whole upper belt assembly 74 to 101 is raised and lowered by the air cylinders 42, 43 acting through their pistons and the linking members, 77, 78, to adjust the space between the lower rims 27 of the belts 21A, 21B and the upper rims 28 of the belts 22A. 22B. A torsion bar 102 Figures 4, 5, and 8 carries pinions 103, 104 mating with racks 105, 106 respectively towards the ends of the channel section 74, to ensure that both ends of the upper belt assembly move together, even if one of the air cylinders 42, 43 fails to operate. The lower adjusted position of the assembly is determined by adjustable stop means 107, and fine adjustment means 108, situated adjacent both air cylinders 42, 43, but only those adjacent the air cylinder 43 being shown in Figures 3 and 8.The adjustable stop means comprise frames 109 each containing two nuts 110, 111 on vertical screws 112, 113 respectively. The screws 112 being rotatable by a stepping motor not shown through a shaft 114 and gearboxes 115, while the screws 113 are rotatable by toothed belt end pulley drives 116 from the screws 112. The rear end of each frame 109 has an angle bracket 117 with a top stop surface 118, while the front end of the frame 109 has a pair of cheeks 119 extending through slots 120 see also Figure 1 in the lower side plate 65 and carrying a block 121 with a top stop surface 122.The fine adjustment means 108 each comprises pairs of brackets, one 123 being bolted to the upper front side plate 83 and the other not shown being bolted to the bracket 75 or 76 of the upper belt assembly, and the brackets being provided with bolts 124, 125 and lock nuts 126, with the heads of the bolts resting on the stop surfaces 118, 122 respectively. The air cylinders 42, 43 also enable the belt assembly to be riased rapidly in the event of a carton jam mi ng between th e forwarding runs 27, 28. The tucker 52 shown in Figure 1, 2, and 9 and rotated interm ittantly by a stepping motor 53 has two tucker arms 127 each operating alternately. The plough 33 shown in Figures 1, 10 and 11 is mounted between pivot blocks 128 bolted to the lower side plate 65 and has a toggle linkage 129 to a bracket 130 and a handle 131 for quick movement into and out of the position shown. The associated knife guide 39 is pivoted on the plough 33 and has a coil spring 132 urging it towards the position shown. The plough 34 shown in Figures 1, 10 and 12 consists of two horizontal axis radiused rollers 133, 134 and two vertical axis radiused rollers 135, 136 with successive rollers 134, 135, 136 at slightly lower levels, all the rollers being mounted on a fitting 137 carried by a bracket 138 bolted to the upper front side plate 83, so as to move up and down with the upper belt assembly 74 to 101 . The associated knife guide 40 is pivotally mounted on a bracket 139 which is vertically adjustable on the lower side plate 65 to suit the adjusted positions of the plough 34.
