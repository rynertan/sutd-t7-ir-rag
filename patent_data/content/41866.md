# Process for producing porous nickel bodies.

## Abstract
Porous bodies are produced by sintering a body of nickel powder incorporating from 0.35 to 2.0 by weight of carbon under a reducing gas at a temperature above 750 C but below 1050 C. At least part of the carbon may be mixed with the powder as finely divided graphite.
