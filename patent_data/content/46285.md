# Process for the preparation of polyolefinic plasto elastomeric compositions by means of dynamical vulcanization.

## Abstract
Preparation of plasto elastomeric compositions en dowed with an improved processability and consisting of a blend or mix of EPDM rubber cross linked with a thermoplastic olefinic polymer, by means of dynamical vulcanization, using as a cross linking agent for the rub ber a halogen donor free system consisting of a phenolic non halogenated resin and a particular oxide or metal carbonate.
