# Welding of tubes to tube plates.

## Abstract
Welding of tubes to tube plates using a non consumable electrode to locally melt the wall of a tube 10 and an adjacent area of the tube plate 14 where the tube has been entered into a hole 12 in the tube plate. So that consistently high quality welds can be obtained throughout the entire tube plate without a build up of heat in the tube plate preventing the successful completion of the operation, an initial weld preparation comprises the machin ing of one face of the tube plate 14 to produce respective annular grooves 20 concentrically around the holes 12 into which the tubes are subsequently to be entered.
