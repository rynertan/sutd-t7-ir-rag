# Improved plastic nozzles for inhibiting premature polymerization therein of cyanoacrylate adhesives.

## Abstract
A nozzle for use on containers for holding cyanoacrylate adhesives is comprised of moldable materials having an organic acid dispersed therein in an amount effective to pro vide an acidic surface for inhibiting the polymerization of the adhesives within the nozzle. The amount of organic acid emp loyed preferably ranges from 0.01 to 0.5 by weight of the moldable materials.
