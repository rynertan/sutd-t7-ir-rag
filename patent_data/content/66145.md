# Reciprocating piston internal combustion engine.

## Abstract
A piston 10 movably disposed within an engine cylinder 12 , the top surface 10a of the piston defining thereon a combustion chamber a space 18a formed in the piston a movable member 26 disposed within the space and movable in the direction of a minor thrust side cylinder wall 12a upon receiving a gas pressure within the combus tion chamber and a device 28 for providing the gas pressure into the space 18a of the piston during compress ion strobe of the engine so that the movable member 26 receives the gas pressure, thereby effectively reducing piston slap noise.
