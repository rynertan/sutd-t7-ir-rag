# IMPROVED CONTAINER FOR FREEZEABLE LIQUIDS, USED IN PARTICULAR FOR EXTRACTING HEAT FROM SMALL ENCLOSURES

## Abstract
The invention relates to an improved container for freez able liquids, used in particular for extracting heat from small enclosures. This container is substantially composed of more than one hollow element, which may have a parallelepided, spher ical, or any other geometrical shape, that contain the freeze able liquid these hollow elements are connected to each other by non rigid connection elements so that, even when the liquid is frozen, relative movement between the various hollow elements is possible. The container may be included in ice boxes or similar constructions, or may be itself adapted to define an internal space into which the products to be refrigerated can be inserted.
