## Description
ELECTRIC COOKING UTENSIL The present invention relates to electric cooking utensils such as toasters and sandwich makers. Conventional toasters are constructed to have the material to be toasted located in a wire cage within a housing with electrical heating elements disposed between the cage and housing. Toasting of the material takes place due to radiant heat from the heating elements which must therefore produce red heat. The disadvantage of this arrangement is that because the heating elements produce red heat, the housing of the toaster must be spaced therefrom which results in undue bulk while nevertheless still resulting in the casing becoming unacceptably hot. Sandwich makers have a different construction in that heated plates are brought into contact with the material to be cooked but it is usual to have the plates heated by conventional electrical heating elements disposed on the other side of the plates from the material to be cooked. The disadvantage of this arrangement is that again the casing tends to become unacceptably hot. In both the above prior devices, the amount of energy consumed is considerably in excess of the amount theoretically required because with a toaster much heat is lost to the casing and to atmosphere while in the case of a sandwich maker heat is lost to the casing and in heating up the plates. It is an object of the invention to rovlde.an electric cooking utensil utilising a heater construction which will overcome or at least mitigate the above disadvantages. To this end, the invention provides a heated construction comprising a base substrate, at least one surface of which is electrically insulating, said surface being provided with a printed heating element. In use, the heater construction is brought into intimate contact with the material to be heated. The advantage of this arrangement is that the temperature of the heat may be as little as 2500C and yet still produce acceptable results. This in turn means that a casing used to house such a heater construction can be positioned much closer to the heater than before while still being kept at a relatively low and hence safe temperature which will reduce the overall bulk of the casing. Features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the following description given by way of example when taken in conjunction wih the accompanying drawings in which Figure 1 shows a perspective view of a heater according to the pres ent invention Figure 2 shows a basic electric cooking utensil using heaters as shown in Figure 1 Figure 3 shows a further basic electric cooking utensil using heaters as shown in Figure 1 Figure 4 shows a perspective view of a practical electric cooking utensil using heaters as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 5 shows a diagrammatic cross sectional view of the cooking utensil of Figure 4 generally taken along the line V V. Figure 1 shows an embodiment of an electric heater for a cooking utensil according to the present invention.The heater comprises a substrate 10 with a serpentine conductor 11 provided on one major surface 12 of the substrate 10 . Control equipment 13 is provided on the other major surface 14 of the substrate 10j.The control equipment 13 comprises electronic feedback control not requiring any electro mechanical components. The heater substrate 10 may be made from a variety of materials, such as high temperature engineering plastics materials, glasses, alumina or insulated metals, the maximum processing temperature of the substrate determining which electronic materials can subsequently be processed upon it. In a preferred embodiment aluminium is used because of its low thermal mass i.e. it heats quickly , cheapness and ready machinability. With aluminium, or any other metal, an insulating layer is required this may be sprayed or screen printed onto the metal. Thermoplastics materials, such as polyimide after curing,are particularly useful as they are tolerant of mismatches in coefficients of linear expansion. To provide a compact unit it is desirable to keep the substrate thickness to a minimum however it is also important not to sacrifice mechanical strength.With an aluminium substrate, for example, a thickness of about imm would be about the lowest practicable unless the mechanical strength were improved by adding a webbing on the back of the substrate. With metallic substrates there is also the insulating layer to be considered. This must be thick enough to avoid short circuits through pinholing and dust. A satisfactory insulator thickness for polyimide on an aluminium substrate is about 60 jim. The serpentine conductor 11 of the heater inFigure 1 is a heating element. This may be made from a variety of conductive materials deposited on the substrate by a suitable method, e.g. creen printing or writing with a robot arm. The type of material used is chosen to be compatible with the substrate and insulator if applicable , on high temperature glasses commercially available thick film type materials may be used among other possible materials are metal powders or insulants loaded with metal particles, such as polyimide loaded with silver flake. The thickness of the heating element is largely determined by current carrying requirements and a thickness of about 10 pm is suitable for many applications. The configuration of the heating element is serpentine in the embodiment shown in Figure 1 but other configurations may be used. By increasing the density of the element on the substrate a greater Watts density is obtained and hence a shorter cooking time. However, care must be taken not to thermally overstress the element this could be avoided by using a feedback system from a surface mounted thermocouple or thermistor to the control electronics.The control equipment itself need not be directly attached to the substrate as shown in Figure 1 but may be arranged elsewhere within the cooking utensil of which the heater is a part. It is advantageous to cover both sides of the heater with a food grade non stick coating such as are commercially available. Also the heater may be moulded by bending and pressing into a three dimensional shape as desired. Figures 2 and 3 show two basic electric cooking utensils which use heaters as shown in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows a toaster having relatively movable housing parts 20 and 21 each provided with a heater 22 and 23 respectively. The housing parts 20 and 21 are hinged together at 25 to permit opening and closing of the housing. A piece of bread to be toasted is identified by the reference numeral 26. The heater 23 is fixed relative to its housing part whereas the heater 22 is mounted in a post 27 to be movable as indicated by the arrow A in order to ensure that when the housing parts 20,21 are closed together, the surfaces of the heaters 22,23 on which the conductors are provided will be in intimate contact with the opposite sides of the slice of bread 26 and different thicknesses of bread can be accommodated. As an alternative the heater 23 could also be movable in the same way as heater 22. An alternative construction would be to have an intermediate arm, one end of which is hinged at 25 and the other end of which is connected to the housing part 21. This would enable the toaster to accommodate different thicknesses of bread to be toasted without necessitating the use of floating heaters although such could be used with the intermediate arm construction. Figure 3 shows an alternative construction for a toaster. In Figure 3, like reference numerals are used for like parts. This construction is similar in many ways to that shown in Figure 2 in as much as heaters 22,23 may be fixed or floating . The major difference is in the way the housing parts are connected together and co operate to accommodate the slice of bread to be toasted. In Figure 3, the housing part 21 is hinged to an intermediate member 30 which is reciprocable with respect to the housing part 20 as indicated by the arrows inFigure 3. The member 30 forms the position rod of a piston assembly whose piston head 31 is biased by a spring 32 to the upper, closed position. The hinge 25 may be provided with a ratchet arrangement whereby the housing part 21 can assume and maintain any desired angular position with respect to the member 30. Figures 4 and 5 show a practical embodiment of a cooking utensil which latches in a different manner from that used in the simple embodiments of Figures 2 and 3 like reference numerals are used wherever possible . Figure 4 shows an upright cooking utensil using heaters in two pairs to defined two cooking areas, each pair comprising one fixed heater 23 and one floating heater 22 located in respective housing parts 21 and 20 with thermally and electrically insulating material between each heater and its housing part. The housing parts 20 , containing floating heaters 22 . are hinged to allow cleaning of the surfaces of all the heaters.In each cooking area an ejector 50 is provided movable between a first, raised position and a second lowered cooking position as indicated by arrow B. Between the cooking areas is an operating column 52 which houses a brown control 53 , for setting the length of the cooking time, and an operating handle 41 . The whole utensil is mounted by means of a base portion 54 which is attached to a detachable drip tray 55 . To use the cooking utensil, a desired cooking time is set using the brown control 53 , the food to be cooked, e.g. bread 26 , is dropped into one or both cooking areas to rest on the ejector 50 in its raised position. The operating handle 41 is lowered manually, the ejector 50 is moved to its lower position and the floating heater 22 moves towards the fixed heater 23 until it is brought into intimate contact with the food to be cooked. If no food is present in the cooking area projections 37 on one housing 21 impact the opposite housing 20 on the lowering of the operating handle 41 so that contact between the facing heaters is avoided.Clearly projections 37 could be located on either housing whilst still achieving the some effect. Figure 5 shows a cross sectional view of the cooking utensil of Figure 4 in a closed, cooking position and more clearly illustrates the working of the cooking utensil.The operating handle 41 is connected to a separation device 40 which has a slanting profile to its top face.The separation device 40 is biased towards the top of the operating column 52 by a spring not shown .The floating heater 22 is biased towards the fixed heater 23 by a further spring not shown but its movement is restricted by the separation device 40 in two ways firstly a lip 36 along one edge of the separation device 40 protrudes behind the floating heater 22 limiting the maximum separation of the two heaters, and secondly a cam follower 35 provided on the free surface of the floating heater 22 rests on the slanting top of the separation device 40 and is constrained to move along this profile when the separation device 40 is moved up and down. When the operating handle 41 is manually depressed the separation device 40 is lowered and the ejector 50 is moved to its lower position. The floating heater 22 is gradually freed to move under the action of its bias spring and it is brought up against the food to be cooked 26 . A latch 44 biased in the direction D by a spring not shown engages a notch 43 provided in the separation device 40 . The separation device 40 is retained in its lowered position, electrical contact is made and current flows in the conductors 11 of each heater. When the current has flowed for the time set by the brown control 53 a solenoid 45 is activated which pushes the lower end 44a of the latch 44 and disengages the latch from the notch. Electrical contact is broken and the separation device 40 is released and moves upward under the influence of its bias spring.The cam follower 35 is moved along the slanting profile of the rising separation device 40 causing the floating heater 22 to move away from the fixed heater 23 .A bar 42 attached to the separation device 40 is brought up against the ejector 50 when the heater separation has reached its maximum and the ejector 50 is raised to its first position. Figure 5 only shows half of the cooking utensil.The other pair of heaters are operated in a similar way with certain details open to variation. A single operating handle 41 may be used to operate one separation device 40 configured to control the separation of both sets of heaters, or altcrnative3y, two separation devices 40 one for each pair of heaters. Further, two operating handles 42 may be provided to operate two separation devices 40 one for each pair of heaters. Whichever mode is used the provision of floating heaters 22 enables the heating elements 11 to contact the food 26 directly. The brown control 53 comprises electronic timing circuitry connected to the heater elements 11 and to the latch release mechanism. Although a solenoid 45 has been described as the means for initiating latch release other known mechanisms could be used. The drip tray 55 may be detached and a wall mounting bracket attached to the base portion 54 of the cooking utensil for mounting the utensil in a transverse,generally horizontal plane. Similarly, special mountings could be used to enable the utensil to be suspended under a cabinet. Also, as in the simpler embodiments, both heaters in a pair may be floating rather than having one heater floating and one fixed within its housing part.
