# Bar code reading method and apparatus.

## Abstract
The invention provides a method of reading bar codes without the necessity of keeping the optical reader scanning at a constant speed, while still assuring correct readings irres pective of slight increases or decreases in bar and space widths. According to the invention a comparison reference value is calculated from a zone value representing the width con stant each zone value is compared with the comparison refer ence value and finally the width of each zone is determined from a decision as to which value is larger, the zone value or the comparison reference value. Furthermore the invention provides an apparatus for reading bar codes without the necessity of keeping an optical reader scanning at a constant speed, while still assuring cor rect reading irrespective of slight increases or decreases in bar and space widths.
