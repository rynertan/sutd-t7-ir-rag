## Description
PROCESS FOR PURIFYING PROPYLEI E POLYMERS The present invention relates to a process for purifying a propylene polymer, and more particularly, to a process for removing catalyst residues from a propylene polymer obtained by polymerizing propylene in liquid propylene. During the past years, several methods have been proposed for removing catalyst residues from propylene polymers produced by bulk polymerization processes Chomopolymerization and copolymerization . For example, Japanese Patent Publication No. 79589 1975 dis closes a process to remove catalyst residues by bringing a polymer slurry containing polypropylene into contact countercurrently with liquid propylene. This process, however, has a disadvantage that the contact of polymer slurry and liquid propylene generates a high molecular weight polymer and the removal of catalyst residues is not complete without an additional catalyst removal process. Japanese Published Application No. 102681 1975 discloses a process to suppress the formation of high molecular weight polymer by performing the step of contacting the polymer slurry with liquid propylene in the presence of propylene oxide. This process for removal of catalyst residues still requires an additional catalyst removal process. Japanese Patent Publication No. 6889 1979 discloses a process to remove catalyst residues by bringing the polymer slurry into contact countercurrently with liquid propylene in the presence of alcohol, removing propylene by flashing, and subsequently bringing it into contact with gaseous epoxide. However, a substantial amount of metal components, particularly titanium, are not removed by the process. Japanese Patent Publication No. 13607 1967 discloses an improved process for purifying a polyolefin containing catalyst residues with an alkaline alcohol solution of pH 9 to 12. The purification is performed at a temperature lower than 75OC and under atmospheric pressure in the presence of oxygen. This process, however, presents the following problems 1 the solution should be kept at pH 9 to 12 with an alkaline alkoxide, 2 much metal is left unremoved in the finished polymer, and 3 the finished polymer is poor in appearance due to the residues of alkali metal and amine compound. Japanese Patent Publication No. 34980 1976 discloses a process for purifying polyolefin by bringing a polyolefin containing catalyst residues into contact with oxygen at a pH lower than 9 in the presence of alcohol. This process requires careful maintenance of the catalyst at a pH lower than 9, particularly at pH 3 to 6, and the removal of titanium is not necessarily satisfactory. The purpose of the present invention is to provide a process for purifying a propylene polymer which is obtained by homopolymerizing propylene or copolymerizing propylene and ethylene or alpha olefin excluding propylene such as n butene l, n pentene 1, 4 methylpentene l, or n hexene 1 in the presence of a polymerization catalyst containing a titanium halide and organoaluminum compound. The process of the present invention comprises purifying, i.e deashing a slurry of propylene polymer, bringing the slurry of propylene polymer into contact with an agent capable of solubilizing titanium halide compounds and oxygen and subsequently liquid propylene, said propylene polymer being obtained by polymerizing propylene orpropylene and ethylene or alpha olefin in liquid propylene in the presence of a catalyst containing a titanium halide and organoaluminum compound. As indicated above, the propylene polymer useful in the presentInvention is prepared using a Ziegler type catalyst, particularly an organoaluminum titanium halide type. Examples of the titanium halide used in the polymerization catalyst include chlorides and bromides of titanium, and preferable among these are titanium trichloride and titanium tetrachloride. The titanium trichloride may be obtained by reducing titanium tetrachloride with hydrogen, metallic aluminum or an organoaluminum compound. These titanium chlorides may be activated by contact with an activator such as an electron donor compound such as alcohol, ether, ester, amine, acid halide, and, acid anhydride and or a halogen containing compound such as titanium tetrachloride, silicon tetrachloride, tin tetrachloride, hydrogen halide, and halogenated hydrocarbon, or halogen such as iodine and chlorine. These titanium chlorides may be supported by a proper carrier such as a magnesium compound chloride, oxide, hydroxide, alkoxide, etc. , a calcium compound chloride, oxides, etc. , silica, alumina, titania, boria, chromia, etc. Preferred titanium chlorides include those containing active tianium chloride, which is obtained by reducing titanium tetrachloride with an organoaluminum compound and treating the resultant titanium chloride with the above mentioned activator, or by bringing titanium tetra chloride into contact with the above mentioned carrier and activator. The preferred organoaluminum compounds used in combination with titanium halide as the polymerization catalyst include triethyl aluminum, diethyl aluminum chloride, ethyl aluminum dichloride, and ethyl aluminum sesquichloride. Titanium halide and organoaluminum compound as the polymerization catalyst may be used in combination with the above mentioned electron donor compound, phosphorus containing compound, sulfur containing compound, etc. Polymerization is accomplished by bringing propylene or propylene and other olefin, as the case may be, into contact with the aforesaid catalyst in liquid propylene, in the presence of a molecular weight modifier such as hydrogen. Polymerization is accomplished under varied conditions according to the catalyst to be used, the object and use of polymer to be obtained, and the process to be employed. Usually, the reaction temperature is 30 to 100oC and the pressure is high enough to keep propylene in the liquid form at the reaction temperature. The polypropylene obtained according to the aforesaid process is purified in accordance with the present invention by contacting the polypropylene slurry with an agent capable of solubilizing titanium halide compounds such as alcohol and or diketone and oxygen and subsequently washing the polypropylene with liquid propylene. In the initial step, the polypropylene slurry may be brought into contact with an alcohol or mixture thereof andXor dike tone or mixture thereof and oxygen simultaneously. Alternatively, the polypropylene slurry may initially be brought into contact with an alcohol and or diketone and then with oxygen. The latter method is preferable because halogen and aluminum are removed more effectively. The alcohol used in this invention is an aliphatic or alicyclic alcohol having 2 to 10 carbon atoms, and preferably a branched alcohol having 3 to 8 carbon atoms. Examples are 2 propanol, 2 butanol, 2methyl 2 propanol, 2 methyl 2 butanol, 2, 3 dimethyl 2 butanol, methyl3 pentanol, 3 ethyl 3 pentanol, 2 methyl 2 hexanol, 3 methyl 3 hexanol, and 3,5 dimethyl 3 hexanol. Also preferred is cyclohexanol. Mixtures of these alcohols may be used. The ketone used in this invention is exemplified by alpha dike tone such as diacetyl, acetylpropionyl, acetylbutyl, dipropionyl, dibutylyl, and acetylbenzoyl beta diketone such as acetylacetone, propionyl acetone, and butylyl acetone. Preferable among them is beta diketone, especially acetylacetone. Mixtures of these diketones may be used. These alcohols and dike to nes may be used in pure or diluted form or may be dissolved in liquid propylene or other suitable carrier.Also, mixtures of the alcohol and diketone may be used. The alcohol and or dike tone is used in an amount more than 1 mole, preferably 2 to 100 moles, more preferably 5 to 30 moles, per mole of the organoaluminum compound contained in the the catalyst. The oxygen with which the polypropylene slurry is brought into contact may be oxygen gas or air. In addition, any compound which liberates molecular oxygen or an oxygen radical in situ may be used. Examples of such a compound include hydrogen peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, tbutylhydroperoxide, and dicumyl peroxide. The oxygen is used in an amount of more than 0.01 gram mole preferably 1 to 30 gram moles, for 1 gram atom of titanium in the polymerzation catalyst. If the quantity of oxygen is under this limit, the purification will not be fully attained, and if the quantity is over this limit, there is a danger of catalyst system contamination and even explosion. The step of contacting polypropylene with alcohol and or diketone and oxygen should preferably be performed for 1 to 60 minutes at a temperature of 20 to fOOoC and under a pressure from atmospheric pressure to a pressure of 50 kg cm2. The polypropylene slurry which has been brought into contact with an alcohol and or diketone and oxygen is further brought into contact with liquid propylene, whereby the catalyst components are mostly removed. The contact with liquid propylene may be accomplished in any manner, but complete contact should preferably be performed countercurrently. The liquid propylene may be used in any amount, but usually in an amount equal to or more than the polypropylene slurry. In addition, the contact with liquid propylene may be performed one or more times.Contact performed at 10 to 80 C for 1 to 60 minutes should be sufficient for most applications. The polypropylene slurry purified as mentioned above is pro cessed into final product through propylene separation, drying, pelletization, and, if necessary, incorporation of additives. In summary, the process of this invention results i.. the reduction of catalyst residues, particularly titanium, in finished polypropylene to low levels. Thus, the process of this invention eliminates disadvantages resulting from the residual catalyst components and improves the color of finished polypropylene. The invention is illustrated by the following examples.Example 1 Preparation of titanium trichloride catalyst component Into a flask equipped with a stirrer were charged with agitation at 0 C 100 ml of purified heptane and 60 ml of titanium tetrachloride.Then, to this heptane solution of titanium tetrachloride were added dropwise with agitation at OOC over 6 hours a mixture solution consisting of 82 ml of diethylaluminum chloride and 84 ml of purified heptane. After dropwise addition, the content was heated with stirring to 650C over 1 hour, and stirring was continued for another 1 hour at 65 C to give a solid product. After separation, the solid product was washed with purified heptane and then dried at 65 C under reduced pressure for 30 minutes. The resulting solid product called reduced solid hereinafter was black violet in color. The peak of beta titanium trichloride was not detected in the X ray diffraction spectrum. Fifty two grams of the reduced solid was dispersed into 80 nil of purified heptane. This dispersion was mixed with stirring with a solution prepared by dissolving 41 g of hexachloroethane equivalent to 0.7 mole per 1 gram atom of titanium in the reduced solid and 42 nil of di n butyl ether equivalent to 1.0 mole per 1 gram atom of titanium in the reduced solid into 66 ml of purified heptane. The mixture solution was stirred at 850C for 5 hours, washed five times with 150 ml of purified heptane, and dried at 650C for 30 minutes to give the titanium trichloride catalyst component. Polymerization of propylene Into a 3 liter autoclave was charged a mixture liquid of 15 mg of the catalyst component obtained as above, diethylaluminum chloride in an amount equivalent to 15 moles per 1 gram atom of titanium in the catalyst component, and ethyl benzoate in an amount equivalent to 0.02 mole for 1 mole of the diethylaluminum chloride. Then, 1,200 ml in standard conditions and 1,600 ml of liquid propylene were added. After that, the polymerization of propylene was performed at 700C for 5.5 hours.The resulting propylene polymer was found to contain 15 ppm of titanium. Purification of propylene polymer To the slurry of the resulting polymer was added isopropyl alcohol in an amount of 10 moles for 1 mole of diethylaluminum chloride used in the polymerization of propylene, maintaining contact for 1 minute at 630C, and then dry air in an amount equivalent to 2.0 moles as oxygen for 1 mole of titanium trichloride in the catalyst component used for the polymerization of propylene. Subsequently, the slurry was stripped of liquid propylene. The solids were washed twice with 1.5 liters of liquid propylene and dried at 600C under reduced pressure to give polypropylene powder. The resulting polypropylene powder was pure white, and the content of ash in the polypropylene was 3 ppm for Ti, 11 ppm for Al, and 18 ppm for C7. Example 2 Purification of propylene polymer was carried out as in Example 1 except that isopropyl alcohol and dry air were added simultaneously to the polymer slurry and contact was maintained for 15 minutes at 620C in the process for purifying the propylene polymer. The content of ash in the polypropylene was 3 ppm for Ti, 15 ppm for A7, and 22 ppm for C7. Examples 3 to 5 Purification of propylene polymer was carried out as in Example 1 except that air was used in amounts of 5, 10, and 30 moles as oxygen per 1 gram atom of titanium in the catalyst component.
