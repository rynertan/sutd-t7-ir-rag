# Automobile antenna system.

## Abstract
An automobile antenna system for receiving broadcast waves by means of a plurality of antennas which are provided on a vehicle body and outputs the receiving signal from the antenna which enjoys the optimum reception by automatic changeover. The antenna system is composed of a pair of glass antennas disposed on the rear window of the vehicle body and a pair of high frequency pickups disposed on both sides of the vehicle body apart from the glass antennas by a predetermined distance for effectively picking up high frequency surface currents which are induced on a vehicle body by broadcast waves, these four antennas constituting a diversity antenna.
