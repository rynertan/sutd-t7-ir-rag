# PROCESS FOR PRODUCING A CHLOROMETHYLATED POLYMER

## Abstract
A process for producing a chloromethylated polymer by reacting styrene polymer particles with chloromethyl methyl ether in the presence of a catalyst, characterized in that hydrogen chloride is added to the reaction product mixture, followed by distillation to recover a distillate mixture con taining chloromethyl methyl ether.
