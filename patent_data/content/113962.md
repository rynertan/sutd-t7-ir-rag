# Vacuum interrupter.

## Abstract
A vacuum interrupter which enhances current interrup tion capability for large current of high voltage. The inter rupter includes a vacuum envelope 23 , a pair of lead rods which are relatively coaxially movable extending into the envelope from the outside, a pair of contact electrodes 28, 38 each mechanically and electrically connected to the in ner ends of the lead rods at least one of the contact elec trodes being made of material of at most 40 IACS elec trical conductivity and a coil electrode 29 , which is made of material of electrical conductivity higher than that of con tact electrode and all the portions of which are mechani cally and electrically joined to a back surface of the contact electrode, applying an axial magnetic field parallel to arc current across an interelectrode gap. Current paths are shortened in the contact electrode. Currents which reduce the axial magnetic field and impair uniformity of the magne tic flux density are reduced. A direct joining of the contact electrode and the coil electrode allows the interelectrode gap to be increased.
