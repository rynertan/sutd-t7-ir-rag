# Low calcium xanthan gums.

## Abstract
Two novel forms of xanthan gum containing not more than about 400 ppm of calcium are disclosed. Xanthan gum having this low concentration of calcium is prepared from an aqueous fermentation medium substantially free of calcium ion and substantially free of fermentation nutrients which contain calcium. When the fermentation is carried out under conditions of high shear, the low calcium product is characterized in that oil water emulsions of the gum exhibit smooth flow.

## Description
LOW CALCIUM XANTHAN GUMS This invention relates to xanthan gum. The preparation and uses of xanthan gum are well known to those skilled in the field of heteropolysaccharides. While aqueous compositions of xanthan gum have many desirable properties, such compositions have a chunky or non uniform flow. The present invention is based on the discovery that there is a correlation between the calcium of xanthan gum and the flow characteristics of aqueous compositions containing xanthan gum. The invention provides a xanthan gum in which not more than about 1,6 of the xanthan gum carboxyl groups are bound to calcium ions The invention also provides a xanthan gum containing up to about 0.04 weight calcium. The xanthan gum of the present invention, which has not more than abort 400 ppm of calcium, is prepared from an aqueous fermentation medium substantially free of calcium ion and substantially free of calcium containing fermentation nutrients which contain calcium. When prepared under conditions cf high shear the gum provides aqueous oil water compositions having smooth or uniform flow. In the specification the term ppm means parts per million by weight , mesh sizes are U.S. standards, and all parts and percentages are by weight. Aqueous compositions of xanthan gum tend to have a chunky or non uniform flow characteristic. A chunky flow is an uneven, lumpy type of flow such as is encountered with tomato ketchup. A smooth or uniform type of flow is one free of lumps and unevenness such as is encountered with vegetable oil. The aqueous compo sitions include solutions of xanthan gum as well as oil water emulsions. In general, aqueous compositions of xanthan gum containing not more than about 0.04 weight of calcium and fermented under high shear conditions have desirable flow properties, and aqueous compositions of xanthan gum containing not more than about 0.02 weight of calcium and fermented under high shear conditions have best flow properties. The low calcium xanthan gum of the present invention may be prepared by a heteropolysaccharide producing bacterium of the genusXanthomonas by the whole culture fermentation of a medium comprising a fermentable carbohydrate, a nitrogen source, and appropriate other nutrients.The bacterium may be any suitable Xanthomonas species preferably X. campestris. The bacterium is grown in a medium which is substantially free of calcium ions. By substantially free is meant up to about t ppm of calcium ion per each 1 of xanthan gum concentration in the completed fermentation broth, and preferably up to about 2 ppm of calcium per each 1 of xanthan gum concentration in the completed fermentation broth. Thus, if the xanthan gum is to be produced at a final concentration of about 2.1 2.3 , the total calcium ion content of the completed fermentation broth should not exceed about 9 ppm and preferably should not exceed about 5 ppm. To obtain such a low calcium medium the calcium content of the water in the fermentation medium may be reduced to the appropriate level by chemical means, e.g. ion exchange treatment, or by distillation.As commercial sources of organic nitrogen contain appreciable amounts of calcium ion, it is important that the nitrogen source of the present invention be a material which is substantially free of calcium ions. An example of such a nutrient material is Promosoy 100, a soy protein concentrate Central Soya . Use of this material at 500 ppm imparts 1 2 ppm calcium to the medium. The relationship between the total calcium ion content of the fermentation media, the final xanthan gum concentration in the broth, and the calcium ion content of the isolated xanthan gum is expressed in Table 1. TABLE 1 Calcium Ion Relationships Total Final CalciumCalcium Ion Xanthan Gum Content of of Media Concentration Xanthan Gum ppm ppm 12 3 400 8 2 400 4 1 400 6 3 200 4 2 200 2 1 200 Prior art fermentations of xanthan gum failed to appreciate the benefits obtainable by low concentrations of calcium and, indeed, teach the addition of calcium either to the fermentation beer or to the reconstituted xanthan gum. Examples of such prior art teachings are U.S. patents 3,000,790, 3,054,689, 3,096,293, 3,232,929 and 4,053,699 and French patent 2,330,697. In addition the prior art teaches the use of tap water rather than deionized water, not only because of economic considerations, but because tap water contains trace elements required for growth of the gum producing organism. See, for example, Polysaccharide Xanthan of Xanthomonas campestrisNRRL B 1459 Procedures for Culture Maintenance and Polysaccharide Production, Purification and Analysis , Agricultural Research Service, UnitedStates Department of Agriculture ARS NC 51 . Moreover, the prior art teaches the use of distillers solubles or soybean cake as an organic nitrogen source for the fermentation of xanthan gum.See, for example, U.S. patents 3,020,206, 3,281,329 and 3,594,280 and Materials and Methods in Fermentation , pp. 126 127 by G. L. Solomons, AcademicPress, New York 1969 . At a concentration in the fermentation broth of 0.4 weight , DistillersDried Solubles imparts a calcium content of 150.8 ppm to the fermentation broth while at a concentration of 0.45 weight in the fermentation broth soybean meal imparts a calcium content of 16.7 ppm to the fermentation broth.The gum produced at a concentration of about 2.1 2.3 with the use of such organic nitrogen sources would have a calcium content of about 0.66 0.728 calcium in the case of Distillers Dried Solubles and about 0.07 0.08 in the case of soybean meal because xanthan gum binds all available calcium ion up to a maximum level of about 2.6 , assuming that no other calcium is present in the water or other media. com content Xanthan gum is an anionic polysaccharide due to the presence of about 20 glucuronic acid and 4 pyruvate in the molecule. It has been experimentally determined that about 0.026 g calcium will react with all of the carboxyl groups in 1 g of xanthan gum In other words this amount of calcium is the stoichiometric amount based on the carboxyl groups in the xanthan gum molecule. From this relationship it. can be calculated that for each 1 of xanthan gum in the final fermentation broth, a calcium concentration in the broth of 260 ppm is the stoichiometric quantity sufficient to react with all of the carboxyl groups in the xanthan gum molecule. The gum recovered from such a broth will have a calcium content of about 26,000 ppm. The of carboxyl groups that will react with diminishing amounts of calcium can likewise be calculated. The relationship of calcium content to of carboxyl groups bound is shown inTable 2. TABLE 2 Ca Concentration v. Carboxyl BoundTotal Ca Content Xanthan Gum Ca Content of Carboxyl Groups of Media ppm Concentration Xan. Gum ppm Bound 260 1 26,000 100 22 1 2,200 8.5 7 1 700 2.7 4 1 400 1.6 2 1 200 0.8 520 2 26,000 100 44 2 2,200 8.5 14 2 700 2.7 8 2 400 1.6 4 2 200 0.8 650 2.5 26,000 100 55 2.5 2,000 8.5 17.5 2.5 700 2.7 10 2.5 400 1.6 5 2.5 200 0.8 Thus, the xanthan gum of the present invention can be described chemically as xanthan gum in which up to about 1.6 of the carboxyl groups are bound to calcium and the remaining carboxyl groups are bound to sodium, potassium, a mixture of sodium and potassium or other noncalcium cations. The smooth flow obtainable with the low calcium xanthan gum of the present invention is liable, in some cases, to be degraded by high temperature pasteurization conditions. For this reason, it is preferable to pasteurize at temperatures which do not exceed about 800C. During the fermentation of xanthan gum, the fermentation broth is continually monitored to assure good mixing. As the viscosity of. the broth increases with the amount of gum produced, frequent monitoring and a corresponding increase in agitation rate assures that all parts of the broth are properly aerated. The criterion of good mixing, well known to those skilled in the polysaccharide fermentation art, is sufficient to produce the low calcium xanthan gum of this invention. When it is desired to produce the low calcium xanthan gum having smooth flow properties, high shear is required during the fermentation process. The following agitation conditions have been found to be adequate to produce the low calcium, smooth flow xanthan gum of this invention. Agitation comparable to these agitation conditions is defined herein as high shear .Fermentor Size Agitation Conditions 3.8 litres Three 8 cm flat turbine impellors. The initial agitation is set at 400 RItI 32 metres min and is typically increased to 800 1000 RPM 64 to 80 metres min by 16 24 hours.14 litres Three 7.5 cm flat blade impellors. The fermentation is started with an agitation rate of 400 f 30 metres min and is typically increased to 1000 RPM 75 metres min by 16 24 hours. The agitation can be increased as necessary to provide high shear up to 1500 RPM 112 metres min .30 litres Two 12.85 cm V shaped turbine impellors. The initial agitation is 300 RPM 37.5 metres min which is increased to 700 RPM 87.5 metres min by 16 24 hours. 70 litres Two 15 cm flat blad turbine impellors and one 15 25 cm propellor. This fermentor is started with an agitation rate of 300 RPM 45 metres min and increased to 600 RPM 90 metres min by 16 24 hours. It can be increased thereafter as needed to provide high shear to a maximum of 750 RPM 122.5 metres min . The high shear must be imparted to the beer during the fermentation process. If the beer is subjected to high shear after the fermentation is completed, the resulting gum does not exhibit smooth flow. Likewise, it is preferred to continue the high shear conditions throughout the entire fermentation process. A correlation has been found between the smooth flow property of the xanthan gum of this invention and the viscosity of an oil water emulsion made up from the gum. The following test protocol can therefore be followed to determine whether a low calcium xanthan gum can also be characterized as having smooth flow. TEST METHOD 1 3.5 g of low calcium xanthan gum is slurried in 20 g of vegetable oil. The slurry is added. to 300 ml tap water in a Sunbeam solid state Waring blender and mixed for 20 seconds at the lowest speed stir button . Mixing is stopped, 13 g of NaCl is added, and the mix is agitated at the highest speed liquify button for 10 seconds. The entire emulsion is poured into a 400 ml beaker and viscosity readings are obtained at room temperature on a BrookfieldLVF viscometer, spindle 3 at 60 rpm. The xanthan gum used should contain between 86 and 92 solids and should be milled so that at least 98 passes through an 80 mesh screen and less than 40 passes through a 325 mesh screen.A low calcium xanthan gum is smooth flow if under these conditions viscosity readings of less than 1650 cP are obtained. It is preferred that the viscosity be less than 1600 cP. Alternative, although less reliable, tests require visual observations. For example, the emulsion prepared as above is observed while being poured and its flow characteristics noted. A beaker containing such an emulsion is swirled so that its sides are coated and then the sides are observed. If the coating of emulsion on the sides is generally homogenous rather than streaked and uneven, the gum can be considered to be smooth flow. The low calcium xanthan gum of this invention can be used for any of the uses to which xanthan gum can be put. In addition, when still in the fermentation broth it is the intermediary for producing the smooth flow low calcium xanthan gum of this invention. Smooth flow xanthan gum finds applicability in a variety of areas. First, to the extent that its properties are similar to those of xanthan gum, it can be used as a substitute in formulations requiring xanthan gum. However, the smooth flow xanthan gum of this invention is particularly useful in pourable and spoonable salad dressings. Solubility is markedly improved in reconstituted dry mixes such as fruit flavored beverages, cocoa drinks, gravies, and soups. Texture and flow properties are markedly improved in high sugar solids systems such as sugar syrups, toothpaste, shampoo, hand cream, and fruit preserves.

EXAMPLE 1 All the media and media ingredients are prepared sing the following procedure in deionized water to minimize the presence of calcium. The flask seed medium is YM broth Difco . These flasks are inoculated with a loopful of a strain of Xanthomonas campestrisNRRL B 1459 grown on nutrient agar Difco or YM agar plates. The inoculated flasks are placed on a gyrotary shaker New Brunswick Scientific,Inc. at a shaking speed of 200 300 rpm. The temperature is controlled at 28 330C. After 18 40 hours these seeds are used to inoculate a five liter fermentor vessel containing three liters of a medium containing the following ingredients 3.0 Dextrose 0.05 Promosoy 100 Central Soya 0.09 NH4NO3 0.5 Na2HPO4 0.01 MgSO4 7H2O The medium also contains trace elements such as BO3, Mn , Fe , Cu , Zn , Co , MoO 4, and an antifoam agent Sag 471 . The fermentation temperature is controlled at 28 330C with the agitation rate set so that proper mixing of the fermentor contents occurs.Sterile air is supplied at a rate of 0.2 1.0 v v .After 18 4Q hours, this seed is used to inoculate either 50 L of similar medium in a 70L fermentor, or 20L of such medium in a 30L fermentor. This medium is composed of the following ingredients 3.0 Dextrose 0.5 Na2HPO4 0.09 NH4NO3 0.018 MgSO4.7H20 0.05 Promosoy 100 In these fermentors, the pH is controlled in the range of 6.0 7.5 using KOH addition. Aeration is similar to that in the smaller fermentor. The agitation is increased as necessary to maintain high shear. The agitation in the 30L and 70L fermentors is as defined above for high shear .The fermentation is terminated when the carbon source has been fully utilized. The fermentation broth is pasteurized in the fermentation vessel at 750C for 15 minutes. The product is recovered by alcohol precipitation. The recovered fibers are dried for 2 hours in a steam oven at 550C followed by milling through a 20 mesh screen. This product, designated sample 1, is a low calcium, smooth flow xanthan gum. A second batch is prepared following the procedure of sample 1 but using Distillers Solubles as the organic nitrogen source and tap water instead of deionized water. This product, sample 2, is representative of commercially available xanthan gum. A third batch is prepared using the same conditions as those used to prepare sample 1 except that deionized water containing 40 ppm added calcium is used in the media. This product, designated sample 3, is also comparable to commercially available xanthan gum. EXAMPLE 2 1.

Aeration is similar to that in the smaller fermentor. Agitation is as defined above for high shear for a 1 4 litre fermentor Fermentation is terminated when the carbon source is less than 0.1 . The fermentation broth is pasteurized in the fermentation vessel at 75 C for 15 minutes . The product is recovered by alcohol precipitation. The recovered fibers are dried for 2 hours in a steam oven at 550C followed by milling through a 20 mesh screen. The product is a low calcium, smooth flow xanthan gum. EXAMPLE 3 Xanthan gum samples are prepared under varying calcium levels. The viscosities of the gum samples 1 and 2 w w, in deionized D.I. water and 1 w w KC1 solution and low oil emulsions are determined using a Brookfield LVF viscometer, at 60 rpm and appropriate spindle. A slurry of each gum 6.4 g in Kraft vegetable oil specially processed soybean oil 40 g is added to 500 ml of water with stirring.After hydration, sodium chloride 26 g and 10 acetic acid 75 ml are added. The emulsions are milled in a Sterling colloid mill at a setting of 0.015 . Working yield values are determined from the viscosity profiles at low shear rates obtained by using the spring relaxation method on theWells Brookfield RVT plate and cone viscometer. See Jeanes et al., 1973 J. Appl. Polymer Sci.17 pp. 1621 1624. The working yield value is defined as the shear stress dynes cmê required to produce a shear rate of 0.01 sec Visual observation of flow properties are determined by pouring low oil emulsions from container to container. Flow properties are rated as smooth through light chunky , medium chunky to heavy chunky . A quantitative determination of flow properties is carried out by measurement of the flow rate of gum solutions 1 w w in 1 KC1 and emulsions in a Bostwick Consistometer. This instrument which is available from Central Scientific Co., Inc., 26005 Kostner Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60623 determines consistency by measuring the distance that a material flows under its own weight during a given time interval. The distance travelled by the moving front after 5 minutes is a reproducible measure of the flow properties degree of smoothness of the solutions.
