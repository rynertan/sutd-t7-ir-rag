# Display devices.

## Abstract
A display device is described which comprises a liquid crystal host material 1 and an anisotropically emitting fluores cent guest material 13 dissolved in the host material such that the molecules of the guest material 13 align with the molecules of the host material 1 . An electric field applied across the host material 1 causes the direction of radiation emitted by the guest material 13 incident on an interface between two materials 1, 9 of different refractive index to vary so as to control the amount of radiation emitted by the display.
