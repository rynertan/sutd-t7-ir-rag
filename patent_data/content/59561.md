# Highly refractive urethane polymers for use in optical lenses and lenses prepared therefrom.

## Abstract
Highly refractive urethane polymers for use in optical lenses and the lenses produced therefrom are obtained by polymerizing at least one unsaturated urethane compound which is the reaction product of at least one xylylene diisocyanate and at least one compound selected from the group comprising
