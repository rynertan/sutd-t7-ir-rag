# METHOD AND DEVICE FOR TAKING SOIL SAMPLES

## Abstract
A process and device for extracting soil samples, wherein a core sample is extracted from the ground which is to be analysed and part of the soil is removed from the core for subsequent analysis or other after treatment. The core sample is removed from the ground and enclosed in a encasing 32, 34 in which the core sample remains in the form and position it had in the ground prior to extraction. The required volumes of soil samples are removed via openings 46 in the encasing 32, 34 at pre determined points, and collected for further treatment.
