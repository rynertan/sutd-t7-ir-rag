# An electric arc fired blast furnace system.

## Abstract
A blast furnace system for reduction of iron bearing material utilizing electric arc heated air containing a reducing gas or carbon containing fuel allowing for a decrease in the amount of coke normally used in the reduction process. The excess reducing gases exiting the furnace are utilized as a source of power via a system consisting of turbines, compressors and a heat exchanger to drive the electrical generators which are used to provide electricity to the arc heaters.
