# Double carburetor.

## Abstract
A double carburetor including a primary suction conduit 1 and a secondary suction conduit 2 located in a suction passage of an internal combustion engine equipped with a turbosupercharger for supplying supercharged air to a combustion chamber by means of a compressor driven by a turbine rotated by the energy of exhausts has an air fuel ratio correcting control valve 21 for a primary main fuel system of the primary suction conduit 1 and another air fuel ratio correcting control valve 22 for a secondary main fuel system of the secondary suction conduit 2 . The carburetor also has a drive unit 17 which is operative, when the turbosupercharger is put into action, to actuate the air fuel ratio correcting control valves 21, 22 for the primary and secondary main fuel systems to correct the air fuel ratio of fuel air mixtures supplied to the engine by increasing fuel flow or decreasing air flow therethrough.
