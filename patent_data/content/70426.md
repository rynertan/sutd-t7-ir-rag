# Dense dynamic memory cell structure and manufacturing process.

## Abstract
A dynamic memory is provided having a cell with an improved structure and made by an improved process which substantially reduces the capacitance of the bit sense line connected to the cell. The cell has one field effect transistor and a storage node, and the cell structure in cludes a thick insulating segment located under a portion of a conductive layer or field shield and under a portion of the gate electrode of the transistor, while extending over the entire diffusion region of the bit sense line and over sub stantially the entire depletion region surrounding the bit sense line diffusion region.
