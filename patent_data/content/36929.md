# A magnetic bubble device.

## Abstract
This invention relates to a magnetic bubble device including propagation channels 14, 24, 40 and a passive replicator element 10 . The replicator element 10 is a single element which has at least three peripheral areas 18, 20, 32 in spaced relation that are associated with propagation channels 14, 24, 40 . When a rotating in plane magnetic field is applied to the replicator 10 , a first magnetic bubble passes from input channel 14 to the first area 18 and then to second area 20 , where the bubble is split into second and third bubbles 30, 34 . The second bubble 30 passes into second channel 24 and the third bubble 34 passes to the third area 32 and then to third channel 40 .
