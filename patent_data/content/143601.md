# METHOD FOR PRODUCING 1 IODOALKYL ACYLATES

## Abstract
1 Iodoalkyl acylates, which are useful as raw materials for the esterification of cephalosporins and penicillins, are prepared in a high degree of purity and in high yield by reacting a carboxylic acid iodide with an aldehyde. The carboxylic acid iodide may be prepared in situ by reacting a carboxylic acid chloride with a salt of hydriodic acid and then reacting the resulting product with an aldehyde, or by simultaneously reacting a carboxylic acid chloride, a salt of hydriodic acid and an aldehyde with one another.
