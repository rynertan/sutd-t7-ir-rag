# Process for producing infrared light transmitting optical fiber.

## Abstract
A process is disclosed for producing an infra red light transmitting optical fiber by drawing a rod of single crystal or polycrystalline metal halide into a fiber through a die also disclosed is a process for producing an infrared light transmitting optical fiber of step index type by forming around a single crystal or polycrystalline fiber core, an intimate cladding crystal layer having a lower refractive index than the core by working in the temperature range that does not cause recrystallization of the core or cladding during working.
