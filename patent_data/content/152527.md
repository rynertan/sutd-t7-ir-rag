The compounds of formuly I are useful as antioxidants and flame retardants in polymers and in articles of manufacture made of polymers. The compounds of formula I are substantially nonblooming in comparison to most other antioxidants. The present invention is useful in polymers used for electrical insulation, in heat shrinkable tubing and other parts, e.g., and caps made of polyolefins such as polyethylene and use for electrical purposes, as well as in other plastic polymer parts used as utensils or as parts of washing machines to prevent them from becoming brittle due to loss of antioxidant because of soapy water causing the antioxidants commonly used to leach out of the plastic . The compounds of formuly I are particularly useful in heat recoverable heat shrinkable articles of manufacture such as tubing, end caps, boots and other hollow articles to which heat is applied to cause shrinkage because the lack of blooming permits coating with adhesives and inks. Polymers in which the compounds of formula I are useful in this invention include all thermoplastics and thermohardening thermosetting plastics in which antioxidants are employed. Suitable plastics may include polyolefins such as polyethylene high and low density , polypropylene, polybutylene, substituted polyolefins such as halogenated, e.g., grafted polyethylene using a silane such as vinyl trimethoxy silane as the grafting agent. See U.S.Patent No. 3,086,242. The compounds of formula I would also be useful with any polymer whose useful properties are adversely affected by oxidative degradation such as esters, amides e.g. nylon , phenolics, acrylics, rubber, urethanes, vinyls, styrenes e.g. ABS , and others used in the plastics industry. See the Text PLASTICS IN THE MODERN WORLD by E.G. Couzens and V.E. Yarsly 0 1968, published by Pelican Books, Inc.,Maryland U.S.A., for other polymers used in industry and useful in this invention. Prior art patents showing heat recoverable plastics and articles include U.S. Patents 4,048,129, 4,016,356, 3,981,546 and 3, 959,052. It should be understood that heat recoverable articles are meant to include those that are treated by irradiation or chemically treated to produce such articles.

The mixture is stirred and heated to about 550C to effect solution. At this point 80 grams of 95 hydrazine 20 excess is added and heating is continued for three hours.The mixture is cooled and the crystals which separate are filtered and dried. A total of 210 grams of 3,5 di tert butyl 4 hydroxy hydrocinnamic acid hydrazide is obtained 72 yield .
