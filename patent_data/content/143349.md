# APPARATUS FOR PLANT CULTIVATION

## Abstract
A system for the automated cultivation of plants includes a plurality of guide rail pairs 5 which support conveyor driven jigs 6 for carrying individual plants thereon. As the plants are driven by the conveyors 4 , the driving elements or dogs 4a on successive conveyors 4 are increasingly spaced, so as to allow for the steady growth of the plants. The guide rails 5 are arranged in a radial array to allow for increasing side wise plant clearance, and are orificed as a means of providing the plants with air and nutrients.
