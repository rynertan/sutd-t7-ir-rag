# Method of manufacturing a semiconductor device and device manufactured by the use of the method.

## Abstract
A method of manufacturing a semiconductor device, for example an SPS memory having narrow coplanar silicon electrodes. The electrodes are formed by etching grooves or slots 10 having a width in the submicron range into a po lycrystalline silicon layer 3 , the slot width being defined by the oxidized edge 6 of a silicon auxiliary layer 5 . The elec trodes are alternately covered by silicon oxide and by a layer comprising silicon nitride. According to the invention, the electrodes formed covered by silicon oxide 3B, 13B are first interconnected pairwise, whereupon they are separated from each other in a separate etching step and are provided with self aligned contact windows 15 . Thus, the very narrow electrodes can be contacted without technological problems and memory cells of very small dimensions can be obtained.
