# A phase control device for a power converter.

## Abstract
In a phase control device 2B for a power converter 1 having controlled rectifier elements U, V, W, X, Y and Z , a phase detector 10 detects the phase of the AC voltage of the power converter 1 and produces a phase signal ϑ . A pro cessing circuit 11B receives a feedback signal FED of the power converter 1 and compares the feedback signal FED with a reference signal REF to produce a phase control signal Ec enabling the feedback signal FED to become equal to the reference signal REF A firing pulse determination circuit 12 compares the phase signal ϑ with the phase control signal Ec to produce firing pulses TP which are applied to the controlled rectifier elements U, V, W, X, Y and Z . Monitoring circuits 41, 42 judge whether or not the phase control device 2B has failed according to the phase signal ϑ , the phase control signal Ec and a specific firing pulse TPU from the firing pulse determination circuit 12 .
