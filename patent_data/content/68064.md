## Description
SEMICONDUCTOR CIRCUIT INCLUDING A RESONANT QUANTUM MECHANICAL TUNNELLING TRIODE DEVICE This invention relates to semiconductor circuits including resonant tunnelling triode devices. Development of semiconductor devices of the triode, three terminal or transistor type has led to devices having progressively shorter switching times. As the performance advances, however, the standard mode of operation which has involved minority carrier motion by diffusion has been becoming an increasingly significant limitation. The phenomenon of resonant tunnelling has been reported in AppliedPhysics Letters, Vol. 24, No. 12, 15 June 1974, pages 593 to 595. In this type of carrier transport under appropriate conditions the carriers have the same momentum in all places and phonon transitions are not involved. The invention seeks to provide a semiconductor circuit including a triode device the operation of which involves quantum mechanical tunnelling. A semiconductor circuit according to the invention, includes a triode device comprising a monocrystalline semiconductor body having first and third layers on opposite sides of a second layer, each layer being of the same conductivity type, said first and third layers each forming a barrier with said second layer of quantum mechanical tunnelling type, said second layer having such a width and doping that a potential well with a higher and a lower quasistationary energy state is present in said second layer with a Fermi energy level above said lower energy state and a bias voltage source arranged to apply such bias voltages to said second and third layers with respect to said first layer that said higher quasistationary energy state is aligned with the Fermi level in said first layer. How the invention can be carried out will now be described by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which FIG. 1 is a schematic of a triode semiconductor device FIG. 2 is an energy level diagram of the device of FIG. 1 in an unbiased condition, the diagram being dimensionally correlated with the structure of FIG. 1 FIG. 3 is an energy level diagram, similar to that of FIG. 2, but with the device in a biased condition and FIG. 4 is a collector current against base voltage characteristic showing a peak in collector current that is the result of resonant tunnelling in the triode device. In a circuit in accordance with the invention, the physical structure of a triode and the bias applied to it cooperate to permit controllable maj ority carrier flow by the phenomenon of resonant quantum mechanical tunnelling. The combination of a potential well produced between two identical tunnelling barriers, selection of potential well and barrier thicknesses, the provision of a control electrode to the region of the potential well and the establishment of specific biasing related to theFermi level provides a triode device the operation of which involves carrier transport by resonant tunnelling. There are two quasistationary energy states in the potential well region of the device and the bias voltages at which maximum transport occurs are at about twice the energy state values. Under these conditions, majority carriers tunnel through both barriers, the output or collector current vs. collector voltage variation exhibits a substantial peak at the appropriate bias level and conduction is controlled by a signal applied to the potential well region. Since electrons have higher mobility and since most devices are constructed using electrons as majority carriers, the following discussion and illustrations are directed to electron flow it being understood, however, that one skilled in this art could readily make the appropriate substitutions in the light of the principles set forth, for conversion to the use of holes as majority carriers. Referring to FIG. 1, a resonant tunnelling triode device consists of a single crystal semiconductor body 1 having an external region performing the function in a three terminal device of an emitter region 2, a potential well region performing the function of a base region 3, and an external region performing the function of a collector region 4, each region having the same n conductivity type. Ohmic contacts 5, 6 and 7 are provided to the emitter, the base and the collector regions, respectively. In accordance with the invention, the device has a number of dimensional and biasing constraints that in combination produce the controllable resonant tunnelling current flow. The base or potential well region 3 is of a width such that tunnelling majority carriers are not attenuated in traversing the base to the collector barrier and a potential well is established with a high E2 and a low E1 quasistationary energy level. The emitter injecting barrier and the collecting barrier should be identical in width and height as shown in FIG. 2. The barriers should have a width and height suitable for quantum mechanical tunnelling and a height such that a bias on the collector and on the base will align the Fermi level with the higher quasistationary energy state. Referring to FIG. 2, an energy level diagram is illustrated. The potential well or base region is of gallium arsenide doped to 1018 cm and has a width of 50 Angstroms. The emitter region 2 and the cm collector regtion 4 are of GaO 3Alo 7As doped to 10 cm and of 100Angstroms thickness each. Such a structure can be fabricated by the techniques of molecular beam epitaxy MEE or chemical vapour depostion CVD . Under these structural conditions, the Fermi level labelled E in f FIG. 2 in the base region 3 would be approximately 0.15 electron volts above the lower level E1, and the energy level in both the emitter 2 and the collector 4 regions in the vicinity of the ohmic contacts 5 and 7 would be in the vicinity of the Fermi level. In the base region 3, the level of the lower quasistationary state energy E1 is approximately 0.08 electron volts above the lowest level in the base and the value of the higher quasistationary level E2 is approximately 0.28 electron volts above the lowest level. The GaO 3Alo 7As GaAs interfaces would have identical barriers of less than 1 electron volt. The application of bias with the emitter connected to reference voltage as is illustrated in FIG. 3 of approximately 0.3 volts labelled V on the collector 4 and of approximately O.13 volts labelled V on c b the base 3 operates to cause the E2 energy level in the base 3 to be at the same potential as the Fermi level in the emitter and the phenomenon of resonant tunnelling provides carrier flow from emitter to collector under control of an appropriate signal on the base. Referring next to FIG. 4, a graph of the variation in collector current with base voltage is illustrated wherein as the collector voltage is increased, a peak current region is encountered at the level of resonant mechanical tunnelling. The current characteristic curve for the preferred embodiment described where the collector voltage is 0.3 volts exhibits a peak that begins at approximately 0.1 volt base voltage and ends at approximately 0.2 volts. The peak is on average about 0.13 volts in width. What has been described is a technique of applying the phenomenon of resonant quantum mechanical tunnelling to a triode device wherein the base transport is by majority carrier resonant tunnelling through two barriers which serve as emitter and collector of the transistor. The device has three layers of the same conductivity type and exhibits switching speeds of the order of 10 seconds.
