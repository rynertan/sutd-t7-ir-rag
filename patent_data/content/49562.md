# CURVED BEAM APPARATUS

## Abstract
A curved beam apparatus adapted for mounting thereon a scintillation detector. The apparatus comprises a circular C arm which is balanced with a counterweight at one end and a scintillation detector pivotally mounted by means of a yoke at the other end. The C arm is mounted in a carrier member which in turn is attached to a base. The carrier member is rotatable about an axis passing through its center. In addition, the C arm rotates circumferentially along a plane defined by the shape of the C arm and intersecting said axis. The combination of the rotation of the C arm and the rotation of the carrier member permits the scintillation detector to be quickly and easily manually positioned to any desired location on an imaginary sphere surrounding a portion of patient to be examined.
