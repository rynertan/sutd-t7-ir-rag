# Monitor circuit.

## Abstract
A circuit 10 for monitoring digital electrical signals which counts events 40 , compares the event count to a threshold value 44 , generates an equal value signal 50 when the threshold is attained and indicates the time elapsed 59 between an initial value 62 and the generation of the equal value signal 50 . The event counter 12 is automatical ly cleared 18 or reset upon a user enabled automatic clear logic enabling signal 58 . The circuit is preferably configured as a chip employing GaAs Schottky diode field effect transistor logic SDFL gates.
