# A machine having automatic article transport.

## Abstract
In a machine having automatic article transport individ ual identical articles are conveyed along a conveyor path 21 past various processing stations. A clock 12 is asso ciated with the conveyor path. Furthermore, a characteristic detection apparatus 13 is provided which delivers infor mation corresponding to the characteristics of the articles 16 which are moving past to a characteristic shift register 11 , which is pulsed by the clock 1 . An article sorting ap paratus 14 is arranged spaced from the characteristic de tection apparatus and is controlled by the associated stor age 11 of the characteristic shift register. A further pre sence shift register 15 is arranged parallel to the charac teristic shift register 11 and the information contained in the presence shift register 15 is compared with the output of a presence detection apparatus 17 and can be used to stop the machine in the event that a deviation is detected.
