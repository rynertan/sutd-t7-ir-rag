# Sheet like structures and process for producing the same.

## Abstract
A sheet like structure excellent effect of preventing disperse dye migration and sublimation and a process for producing the same are disclosed. The sheet like structure comprising a fibrous structure containing not less than 10 weight percent of disperse dye polyester fibers and having, on at least one side thereof, a resin layer as a coat, with a thin polymer film layer having a thickness of 100 10,000 angstroms. Said thin polymer film layer is formed by low tempera ture plasma polymerization using a monomer having a solubility parameter value smaller than the solubility para meter value of the disperse dye by at least 0.5 cal cmÂ³ 1 2. When the monomer to be used has a smaller solubility parameter value, a greater effect can be produced and the expected effect can be produced even if the thin film layer formed has a smaller thickness.
