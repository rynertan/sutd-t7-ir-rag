# COMPUTER MEMORY SYSTEM WITH PARALLEL GARBAGE COLLECTION INDEPENDENT FROM AN ASSOCIATED USER PROCESSOR

## Abstract
A memory system 10 for association with a user proces sor 20 for operation independently from the user processor 20 includes a physical memory 12 and an interface unit 15 for enabling the associated user processor 20 to access the physical memory 12 . The physical memory 12 is repre sented in a virtuaal address space Area 1, Area 2, Area 3 which is garbage collected in parallel with and concurrently with the operation of the user processor 20 . The garbage col lection process includes reference count deallocation and a garbage collection algorithm for deallocating cyclic structures not deallocated by the reference count process. The reference count process includes providing for a reference count indicat ing the number of pointer references to a memory block 120, 121, 126 129, 122, 132, 133 in the virtual address space Area 1, Area 2, Area 3 . The reference count becomes zero, and no other references to a memory block exists, the block may be deallocated. In the garbage collection algorithm, the virtual memory space is traced in areas OLDSPACE , and com pactly copied into a new area. The OLDSPACE and NEWSPACE are further scavenged to insure that all referenced blocks of memory are copied, and the remaining OLDSPACE is cleaned. The garbage collection process is performed concurrently and in parallel with the operation of the user processor 20 .
