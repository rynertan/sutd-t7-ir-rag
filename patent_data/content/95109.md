# Process for producing expanded particles of a polyolefin resin.

## Abstract
A process for the preparation of expanded particles in which a mixture of water and of polyolefin resin particles, impregnated with a volatile blowing agent, is released from the interior of a pressure resistant container under a con stant temperature and constant pressure, preferably keeping the partial pressure of the blowing agent constant, through at least one orifice having an area of 0.07 to 300 mmÂ², into a low pressure zone. This invention gives various advantages when applied industrially, giving expanded particles with superior prop erties which are free of blocking, showing a remarkably uniform degree of expansion, and being useful for molding.
