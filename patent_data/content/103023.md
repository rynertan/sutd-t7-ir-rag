# SOLID STATE IMAGE PICKUP DEVICE.

## Abstract
Solid state image pickup device having an inter line transfer type of solid state image pickup element with a photodetecting, vertical transfer unit provided with a photosensor 1 , a read out gate 6 and a vertical transfer unit 2 , the photosensor 1 and the transfer unit 2 being formed without being covered with a light shielding unit 11 . A shutter mechanism is opened when light is received by the element when the relationship of Pr Pt Ps holds, where Ps, Pt and Pr are the potentials of the photosensor 1 , the gate unit 6 and the transfer unit 2 , respectively, the mechanism is closed during a charge read out time when the relationship is Ps Pt Pr, and the mechanism is closed during a charge transfer time when the relationship is Pt Ps and Pt Pr, thereby obtaining an image pickup signal based on the charge transferred via the transfer unit 6 .
