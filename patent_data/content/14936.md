## Abstract
A method and a device for connecting an optical fibre with another optical component, for example another optical fibre, by means of three centering elements 22 . The end portion of the optical fibre 6 is positioned and fixed in a sleeve element 12 by means of three centering elements 22 and the sleeve element 12 with the fibre end portion fixed therein and the other optical component 8 are positioned in a coupling device 56 58 with the optical fibre 6 and the other optical component 8 in optical connection with each other. The end portion of the optical fibre 6 is fixed in the sleeve element 12 in an exactly predetermined posi tion in relation to an outer reference surface 25 of the sleeve element and the end portion of the optical fibre 6 is positioned in a correct connection position in the coupling device by positioning said reference surface 25 in engage ment with guiding surfaces in the coupling device.
