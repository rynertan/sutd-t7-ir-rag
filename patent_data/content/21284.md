# Improved ampul and a method for breaking it.

## Abstract
The present invention relates to an improved ampul and to a method of breaking such an ampul. This ampul comprises a hollow tubular or cyclindrical container composed of glass or other breakable material having a reservoir chamber and an upstanding wall portion terminating in a sealable stem or tip portion, and includes a collecting chamber located between the reservoir chamber and stem portion. Upon breaking of the ampul above the collecting chamber, any particles so formed are trapped in the collecting chamber and thus introduction of such matter into the contents of the ampul is markedly reduced.
