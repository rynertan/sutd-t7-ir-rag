# Antiperspirant complexes.

## Abstract
Efficacious, aqueous solution stable antiperspirant complexes comprise an aluminum compound, a zirconium or hafnium compound, a water soluble neutral amino acid, and an inorganic acidic compound. The aluminium compound is preferably an aluminum chlorhydrate having an aluminium to chlorine molar ratio of from about 1.60 to about 2.5 while the zirconium compound is preferably a zirconyl hydroxychloride having a zirconium to chlorine molar ratio of from about 0.67 to about 2.0. In the antiperspirant complex, the aluminium to non aluminium metal molar ratio is from about 2 to about 10, the total metal to chlorine molar ratio is less than about 1.30, and the neutral amino acid to total metal molar ratio is from about 0.09 to about 0.24. The neutral amino acid to total metal molar ratio is from about 0.09 to about 0.75 when the antiperspirant complex is used in non aqueous systems.
