## Description
GLUTAKIMIDE ANTIANXIETY AND ANTIHYPERTENSIVE AGENTS This invention relates to certain glutarimide derivatives and their use as antianxiety and antihypertensive agents. Anxiety has been defined as an apprehension or concern regarding some future event. Most, if not all, people occasionally suffer some symptoms of anxiety in response to appropriate stimuli. In some individuals, these feelings of anxiety or panic in response to the everyday pressures of life can be overwhelming, rendering the individual an unproductive member of society. Whereas individual group counseling represents the preferred primary mode of therapy, the use of cheoterautic agents has proven to be a useful adjunct in the treatment of anxiety, enabling a seriously afflicted individual to regain productive status while undergoing concurrent psychotherapy. Compounds of the class of benzodiazepines are currently the therapeutic agents of choice in the treatment of anxiety. In particular, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and oxazepam are connonly used. However, this class of compounds has a great potential for misuse, particularly among the class of patients undergoing therapy. Moreover, the benzodiazepines generally possess undesir 1 effects and detracting interactions with other drugs, including for example, alcohol. Buspirone, a recently developed non benzodiazepine antianxiety agent, is reported to be largely free of these undesirable characteristics. However, it also suffers certain drawbacks. More particularly, Buspirone is thought to affect dopamine receptors with the resultant manifold display of side effects. Applicants have discovered a class of novel glutarimide antianxiety agents that are generally free from the side effects of Buspirone and the benzodiazepines. Accordingly, this invention is directed to glutarimide derivatives of general Formula IEMI2.1 wherein R1and R2 each independently represent hydrogen, a 1 to 4 carbon alkyl, a 1 to 4 carbon alkoxy, halogen, nitro, hydroxy, SO3H, S02NH2, and when R1 and R2 are taken together, form a fused phenyl group at the 1,2 or 3,4positions, with the proviso that when R1 and R2 are identical they each represent a hydrogen, a 1 to 4 carbon alkyl, a 1 to 4 carbon alkoxy, hydroxy or a halogen group A and B independently represent an oxo, a thio or an imino group having the formula N R6 wherein the R6 group is hydrogen or a 1 to 4 carbon alkyl group R3 is a Ã½odei, a 1 to 4 carbon alkyl or hydroxyethyl group n is an integer of from 2 to 5 and R4 and R5 represent methyl groups or when taken together form a cyclopentane or cyclohexane ring its enantiomers and the pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof. As used herein the term a 1 to 4 carbon alkyl group is taken to mean a straight or branched alkyl group of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Illustrative examples of a 1 to 4 carbon alkyl group as used herein are methyl, ethyl, npropyl, isopropyl, n butyl and isobutyl. Similarly, the term a 1 to 4 carbon alkoxy group is taken to mean a straight or branched alkoxy group of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Illustrative examples of a 1 to 4 carbon alkoxy group as used herein are methoxy, ethoxy, n propoxy, isopropoxy, n butoxy, and isobutoxy. The term halogen group is taken to mean a fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom. The expression pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts is intended to apply to any non toxic organic or inorganic acid addition salt of the base compounds represented by Formula I. Illustrative inorganic acids which form suitable salts include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric and phosphoric acid and acid metal salts such as sodium monohydrogen orthophosphate and potassium hydrogen sulfate. Illustrative organic acids which form suitable salts include the mono, di and tricarboxylic acids. Illustrative of such acids are, for example, acetic, glycolic, lactic, pyruvic, malonic, succinic, glutaric, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, benzoic, hydroxybenzoic, phenylacetic, cinnamic, salicylic, 2 phenoxybenzoic and sulfonic acids such as methane sulfonic acid and 2hydroxyethane sulfonic acid.Either the mono or the di acid salts can be formed, and such salts can exist in either a hydrated or a substantially anhydrous form. In general, the acid addition salts of these compounds are crystalline materials which are soluble in water and various hydrophilic organic solvents, which in comparison to their free base forms, generally demonstrate higher melting points and an increased chemical stability. Preferred compounds of this invention are those compounds of Formula I wherein A and B are oxo. Other preferred compounds are those compounds of Formula I wherein R3 is hydrogen, or compounds wherein n represents the integer 4, or compounds wherein R4 and R5 represent methyl groups or when taken together form a cyclopentane ring. Another preferred group of compounds are those compounds of Formula I wherein A and B are independently an oxo or an imino group having the Formula N R6 , whereinR6 is hydrogen or a 1 to 4 carbon alkylgroup. Yet another preferred group of compounds are those wherein R1 and R2 are taken together to form a fused phenyl ring fused to the 1,2 or 3,4 positions designated at the terminal phenyl ring of Formula I A and B are oxo and R3 represents hydrogen. The most preferred compounds of this invention are those compounds of Formula I wherein R1, R2 and R3 are hydrogen atoms, A and B are both oxo groups, n is either the integer 2 or 4, and R4 and R5 taken together form a cyclopentane ring, that is the compounds 8 1 1,4 benzodioxan 2 ylmethylamino ethyl3 8 azaspi ro C4 , 5J decane 7,9 dione and 8 24 1,4 benzodioxan 2 ylmethylamino butyl 8 azaspiro4, 5decane 7,9 dione, respectively. The Formula I glutarimide derivatives of this invention are prepared in any manner by standard techniques analogously known by those skilled in the art. The compounds of this invention are prepared by condensation of an appropriate heterocyclomethylamino nucleophile ofFormula II with a glutarimide substrate of Formula III as outlined in Scheme IEMI5.1 SCHEME I wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, A, B and n are as defined above in Formula I and L represents a suitable leaving group.This simple nucleophilic condensation reaction is preferably performed by allowing approximately equimolar amounts of the nucleophile II and the substrate III to react from about 1 hour to about 24 hours, depending upon the reactants, the solvent and the temperature at which the reaction is conducted. The reaction temperature can range from 250C to about 15O0C, preferably from about 60 C to about 15O0C. Inasmuch as the reactants employed are typically crystalline solids, the use of solvents in this reaction is preferred. Suitable solvents include any non reactive solvent, preferably those having a boiling point in the range of from 60 C to 1500C, as for example, petroleum ethers chlorinated hydrocarbons such as carbon tetrachloride, ethylene chloride, methylene chloride or chloroform chlorinated aromatics such as 1 ,2,4 trichlorobenzene, or o dichlorobenzene carbon disulfide an ethereal solvent such as diethylether, tetrahydrofuran or p dioxane an aromatic solvent such as benzene, toluene or xylene or an alcoholic solvent such as ethanol. Especially preferred solvents are those known to promote nucleophilic reactions such as dimethysulfoxide and dimethylformamide. The product of Formula I can then be isolated by any appropriate techniques, such as filtering to remove any solid materials and subsequently evaporation the solvent from the filtrate. The glutarimides of Formula I can be purified, for example, using their picric or oxalic acid complexes by standard techniques known to the art. The nucleophilic primary amine of Structure II whereinR3 is hydrogen can readily be prepared, for example, by the reduction of the corresponding cyano derivative ofStructure IVEMI7.1 wherein R1, R2, A and B are as defined above forStructure I.

Suitable solvents include ethereal solvents such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran THF , pdioxane, 1,2 dimethoxyethane DME , diglyme or an aromatic solvent such as benzene, toluene or xylene. Secondary amines of Formula II, wherein R3 is other than hydrogen can be prepared by one of two methods a direct alkylation of the corresponding primary amine Formula II, R3 H with a suitable alkyl halide, tosylate or mesylate in an appropriate solvent, such ds acetonitrile, and in the presence of one equivalent or an excess of an organic or inorganic base such as potassium carbonate or b the acylation of the corresponding primary amine Formula II, R3 H with an appropriate acid chloride in an appropriate solvent such as methylene chloride in the presence of one or more molar equivalents of an organic nitrogen base such as a tri lower alkyl amine, for example triethylamine, or an aromatic amine, such as pyridine. Pyridine can be employed in large excess, and thereby serve also in the capacity of the reaction solvent.The amine so obtained can be reduced to the corresponding secondary amine of Formula II utilizing standard procedures such as via reduction with diborane or lithium aluminum hydride. Many of the cyano derivatives of Structure IV are known in the prior art. Applicants have prepared these cyano derivatives by reacting a compound of Structure VEMI8.1 wherein R1, R2, A and B are as defined in Structure I, with 2 bromo or preferably 2 chloroacrylonitrile. Approximately equimolar amounts of the Structure V compound and the acrylonitrile, are mixed with 2 or more molar equivalents of a base such as potassium carbonate in a suitable solvent.

These mixtures can be readily separated and purified by methods commonly known to those skilled in the art, such as by chromatography on silica gel or fractional recrystalization. Furthermore, when the R1 or R2 groups of a Structure V compound are a hydroxy group, this hydroxy group must be protected prior to undergoing the above described condensation reaction with 2 bromo or 2 chloroacrylonitrile. Suitable protecting groups include benzyl or methyl groups and removal is preferably accomplIshed on the corresponding compound of Structure II.The removal of the protecting group can be by any suitable means generally known to the art, such as by catalytic reduction of the benzyl group or by treatment with an acid such as hydrobromic acid or boron tribromide. The leaving groups of the Structure III compounds can be any group known to those skilled in the art, as for example an ester of a sulfuric or sulfonic acid such as a tosylate OTS or mesylate OMS an iodide, bromide or chloride or a hydroxyl group. Applicants have prepared theStructure III substrates wherein L is a tosylate by treating the corresponding alcohol of structure VIEMI10.1 wherein R4, R5 and n are as defined for Structure I, with a base such as potassium carbonate and subsequently adding a sliqht molar excess of tosyl chloride. The reaction temperature ranges from 780C to about 60 C and preferably from OOC to room temperature. The reaction is allowed to proceed for about 1 hour to about 12 hours depending on the reactants, the temperature and the solvent.Suitable solvents include dimethylformamide dimethylsulfoxide acetone aromatic solvents such as benzene, toluene or xylene or an ethereal solvent such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran THF or 1,2 dimethoxyethane DME . A hydrogen halide acceptor is preferably employed to react with the hydrogen halide that forms during the reaction.For this purpose, one or more .,molar equivalents of an organic nitrogen base can be employed. Suitable organic nitrogen bases include tri lower alkyl amines such as triethylamine, or an aromatic amine such as pyridine, a picoline or a collidine. Pyridine and the picolines and collidines can be utilized in a large excess, serving also as the reaction solvent. Applicants have prepared the Structure VI alcohols by reacting approximately equimolar amounts of an hydroxyalkylamine of Structure VII VII HO CH2 n NH2 wherein n is as defined in Structure I, with a glutaric anhydride of Structure VIIIEMI11.1 wherein R4 and R5 are as defined in Structure I. Preferably a slight excess of either the hydroxyamine or the glutaric anhydride is employed. If one conducts this reaction in a solvent such as benzene or toluene, the water formed during the course of the reaction can be continuously removed, for example, by means of a Dean Stark apparatus, thereby drivinq the amidation reaction to completion. The reaction is allowed to proceed at the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture for a period of fro 12 to 24 hours. The crude product can be subsequently isolated by simple removal of solvent.
