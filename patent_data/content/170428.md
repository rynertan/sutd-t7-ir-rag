# AIR FUEL RATIO DETECTING DEVICE

## Abstract
In an air fuel ratio detecting device with which the air fuel ratio can be accurately detected over the entire range of ratios, both for the lean range and for the rich range, an oxygen pumping element 36 and an oxygen sensing element 32 are arranged opposite one another with a gap therebetween and are disposed in a chamber in which exhaust gas flows. A signal which is symmetric in lean and rich regions can thereby be obtained, and this signal is divided into separate portions in the two regions, which are then composed with a signal from a theoretical air fuel ratio detecting means 40 to obtain a single valued signal accu rately representing the air fuel ratio over the entire operating range.
