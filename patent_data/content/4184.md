# Gas sensing element and method for its production.

## Abstract
Catalytic gas sensors comprise a noble metal filament onto which is applied alumina having a particle size of not greater than 100A and a catalyst material is impregnated into the dried alumina. The alumina may be dried by passage of an electric current through the filament and, prior to coating the filament may be stabilised by coating with a thermally decomposable aluminium salt and decomposed by passing a pulsed electric current.
