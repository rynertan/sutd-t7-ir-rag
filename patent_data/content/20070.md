# Circuit for distinguishing specific pulse patterns in a pulse train.

## Abstract
A circuit for recognising cyclically occurring pulse sequences includes a counter 13 controlled by a D type flip flop circuit 12 to start counting the pulses in the pulse sequence when a specific pulse event occurs. The output of the counter 13 is compared by a comparator 16 with a preset number to provide an output via a gate 26 if the specific pulse event occurs when the number of pulses counted by the counter is equal to a preset number. If the count rises above the preset number the comparator 16 resets the flip flop and no output is produced by the gate 26 .
