# Method of producing electrostrictive effect element.

## Abstract
An electrostrictive element having films or plates of electro strictive material and internal electrode plates superposed alter nately. End surfaces of the electrode plates are exposed at opposed sides of the element. The whole of the exposed end surfaces or the end surfaces of every other electrode layer are surrounded and covered by an insulating layer of an inorganic material, such as glass or glass ceramics. The glass or glass ceramics layer is formed by an electrophoretic process and is then sintered onto the integral body formed of the electrostrictive material and electrode plates.
