# A process of electroforming a metal product and electroformed metal product.

## Abstract
The invention relates to a process of electroforming a met al screen by electrolytically depositing a metal upon a metal matrix having recesses filled with insulating material a separat ing means, such as beeswax, being provided upon the ribs bounding the recesses. The formed first screen skeleton is removed and subject ed to an electrolysis in a second electrolytic bath for deposit ing the same or another metal upon the first screen skeleton. Finally from a third electrolytic bath a top layer of metal is deposited upon the layer deposited from the second electrolyt ic bath. In a preferred process the first electrolytic bath is a nickel bath, the second electrolytic bath is an iron bath or a bath of a nickel iron alloy and the third electrolytic bath a nickel or nickel tin alloy bath. The second and other or third electrolytic bath contain an organic compound improving deposit of metal or metal alloy substantially perpendicular to the surface of the skeleton. The invention also comprises a metal screen comprising a first product skeleton, an intermediate metal layer deposited thereon from a second electrolytic bath and a top layer deposit ed upon the intermediate layer from a third electrolytic bath the inner edges bounding the apertures being substantially free from metal of the intermediate layer and of the top layer.
