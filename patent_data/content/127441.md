# CHARACTER RECOGNITION APPARATUS

## Abstract
A character recognition apparatus has an image data generating section 2 for storing image data corresponding to a character array on a sheet of paper and for generating a series of scan line data constituting one item of image data a segmentation control section 4 for generating starting and end scan line data which define a segment of each character data in accordance with the scan line data sequentially gener ated from the image data generating section 2 and a recog nizing section 6 for detecting any similarities between the reference character data and the character data generated from the data generating section 2 in accordance with the starting and end scan line data and for generating effective data character data which has the largest similarity which is larger than a predetermined value. When none of the similarities exceed the predetermined value, the recognizing section 6 supplies a control signal to the segmentation con trol section 4 to update one item of the starting and end scan line data, thereby allowing the image data generating section 2 to generate character data for a different segment.
