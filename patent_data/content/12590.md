# Non plastic hydraulic cement mixes and process for improving such mixes.

## Abstract
A method is provided for improving the strength and oth er properties of non plastic dry hydraulic cement mixes, such as the dry concrete mixes used for making concrete masonry units. The methods comprises incorporating a synergistic combination of two additives into the cement mix. The first additive is a salified methyl or ethyl substituted benzene or naphthalene sulfonate, and is preferably added in an amount of between about 0.01 and 1 , by weight based upon the weight of the cement. The second additive is a tertiary ali phatic amine oxide, and is preferably added in an amount of between 0.001 and 0.1 .
