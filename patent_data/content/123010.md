# Primary battery.

## Abstract
A primary electrochemical cell 1 capable of selective operation at one of several possible discharge rates. The elec trochemical cell in accordance with the present invention includes a pair of battery stacks 3 and 4 positioned one above the other in a housing 2 of the cell in a spaced apart relationship. One of the battery stacks 3 includes a first plurality of anode structures of first thicknesses and a first plurality of carbon electrode structures 21 of first thicknes ses arranged in alternation with the first plurality of anode structures. Similarly, the other battery stack 4 includes a second plurality of anode structures 22 of second thicknes ses and a second plurality of carbon electrode structures 23 of second thicknesses arranged in alternation with the second plurality of anode structures. The relative thicknesses of the abovementioned components of the two stacks, together with the number of components in the two stacks, can be control led so as to achieve different discharge rates and durations of discharge of the cell at the different rates. The battery stacks may be operated during discharge either individually or together to achieve three possible discharge rates for the cell.
