# Induction furnaces.

## Abstract
An induction furnace has an inner discardable lining 7, 8 formed from one or more preformed shapes of refractory, heat insulating material. The discardable lining is easily replaceable using a minimum of time and effort. The lining provides more efficient furnace operation, as less electrical energy is consumed and less time is required to melt down the solid metallic charge. In addition the molten metal is cleaner i.e. it contains fewer deleterious inclusions compared with a conventional refractory, inner lining.
